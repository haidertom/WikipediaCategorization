Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|270px|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], with an [[empty throne]], 2nd century, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the beginning of the serious study of the history of [[Buddhist art]] in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as [[aniconic]]; the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was only represented through symbols such as an [[Hetoimasia|empty throne]],  [[Bodhi]] tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at [[Sanchi]]), [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], and the [[dharma wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, opening pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] interaction, in particular in [[Gandhara]], a theory first fully expounded by [[Alfred A. Foucher]], but  criticised from the start by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].  Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site.  Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by [[Susan Huntington]], initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZCl3DRN3vsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false note 7 here] for an update on the controversy as of 2007, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Riderless+horse+Buddha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Riderless%20horse%20Buddha&amp;f=false here] for another from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of [[cetiya]] (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred.  Thus the image of the [[empty throne]] shows an actual relic-throne at [[Bodh Gaya]] or elsewhere.  She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE.  Huntington also rejects the association of "aniconic" and "iconic" art with an emerging division between [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.  Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in [[relief]] panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.

== Later periods ==
In later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though [[Theravada]] temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas [[Mahayana]] temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance.  However some schools, such as [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.

'''Baroque painting''' is the [[painting]] associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]]. The movement is often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]], the [[Counter Reformation]] and Catholic Revival,&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=2008-12-11 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of important Baroque art and [[Baroque architecture|architecture]] in non-absolutist and [[Protestant]] states throughout Western Europe underscores its widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S.

Baroque painting encompasses a great range of styles, as most important and major painting during the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, and into the early 18th century is identified today as [[Baroque]] painting. In its most typical manifestations, Baroque art is characterized by great drama, rich, deep colour, and intense light and dark shadows, but the [[classicism]] of French Baroque painters like [[Poussin]] and Dutch [[genre painters]] such as [[Vermeer]] are also covered by the term, at least in English.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in French calling Poussin Baroque would be generally rejected&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[Renaissance art]], which usually showed the moment before an event took place, Baroque artists chose the most dramatic point, the moment when the action was occurring: [[Michelangelo]], working in the [[High Renaissance]], shows his [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] composed and still before he battles [[Goliath]]; [[Bernini]]'s Baroque [[David (Bernini)|David]] is caught in the act of hurling the stone at the giant. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance.

Among the greatest painters of the [[Baroque]] period are [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Caravaggio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 |title=Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name |publisher=Getty.edu |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]],&lt;ref name="Gombrich, p. 420"&gt;Gombrich, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.  Poussin's other contemporary biographer was [[André Félibien]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermeer]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using [[chiaroscuro]] light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]] and [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]].
The Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]] developed a graceful but imposing portrait style that was very influential, especially in England.

The prosperity of 17th century Holland led to an enormous production of art by large numbers of painters who were mostly highly specialized and painted only [[genre painting|genre scenes]], [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[Still-life]]s, [[portrait]]s or [[History painting]]s.  Technical standards were very high, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] established a new repertoire of subjects that was very influential until the arrival of [[Modernism]].

== History ==
[[File:JosefaObidos1.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity of Jesus|''Nativity'']] by [[Josefa de Óbidos]], 1669, [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], [[Lisbon]]]]
The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|addressed the representational arts]] in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees.  This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by a number of clerical authors like [[Molanus]], who demanded that [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].
This return toward a [[Populism|populist]] conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many [[Art history|art historians]] as driving the innovations of [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600, although unlike the Carracci, Caravaggio persistently was criticised for lack of decorum in his work.
However, although [[sacred art|religious painting]], [[history painting]], [[allegories]], and [[portraits]] were still considered the most noble subjects, [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[still life]], and genre scenes were also becoming more common in Catholic countries, and were the main genres in Protestant ones.

===The term===
The term "Baroque" was initially used with a derogatory meaning, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. Others derive it from the mnemonic term "Baroco" denoting, in logical ''Scholastica'', a supposedly laboured form of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | title=What is Baroque? |  journal=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance.  It was first rehabilitated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to [[Renaissance]] art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.

==National variations==
Led by Italy, Mediterranean countries, slowly followed by most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and [[Central Europe]], generally adopted a full-blooded Baroque approach. 

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  Most Dutch art lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including the neighbouring [[Flemish Baroque painting]] which shared a part in Dutch trends, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories in a more clearly Baroque style.

In France a dignified and graceful classicism gave a distinctive flavour to Baroque painting, where the later 17th century is also regarded as a golden age for painting.  Two of the most important artists, [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], remained based in Rome, where their work, almost all in [[easel painting]]s, was much appreciated by Italian as well as French patrons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">[[File:CHOMBEClogo.jpg|frame]]'''CHOMBEC''' stands for the Centre for the History of Music in Britain, the Empire and the Commonwealth.  It was a part of the music department at the [[University of Bristol]] (UK) until the summer of 2017.  It was founded in 2006 by Professor [[Stephen Banfield]]. CHOMBEC's aims were to encourage and provide a focal point for research into the history of music in the [[British Empire]], in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and within the [[West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabmsa.org/newsletters/vol22/page3.htm North American British Music Studies Association, Vol.2, No.2 (Autumn 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

CHOMBEC, in association with the University of Bristol, ran an MA ([[Master of Arts]]) degree in [[Music of the United Kingdom|British music]].  The programme offered the opportunity to specialise in music of the British Empire and music in the West Country.

CHOMBEC also ran seminars and conferences on various aspects of British music.  These have included '[[Vaughan Williams]], [[John Hardy (composer)|Hardy]] and the Ninth Symphony' (spring 2008), '[[Rubbra]] Revived: Sinfonia Sacra and Beyond' (Spring 2008), 'The Sounds of [[Stonehenge]]' (autumn 2008), 'Celebrating [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]]' (spring 2007), and '[[Robert Pearsall]] - Bristol's Forgotten Composer' (autumn 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pearsall2006.org/news/ 2006 - The Anniversary of Robert Lucas Pearsall]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent, 'The Sounds of Stonehenge' explored the multiple soundscapes of the ancient stone's 5,000-year history.  The cultural history of the stones, their acoustics, and Neolithic England's musical instruments were presented in a one-day workshop that brought Stonehenge's legend up-to-date with its depiction and importance in film and rock music.

CHOMBEC still hosts a number of academic archives that have been donated to the Centre since it was founded.  Archives are held at the university's Special Collections section of the Arts and Social Sciences Library and can include manuscript scores, audio recordings, and personal papers relating to the composers and their lives.  In 2008 archives for Edgar Hunt, Sir [[Michael Tippett]], a combined archive for [[Frank Merrick]] and Evelyn Hope Squire, and one for John Raynor were all acquired by the university. These archives join the Stanley Godman archive donated in 2007.

CHOMBEC published a twice-yearly newsletter, ''CHOMBEC News'', with articles on composers, performers, and research projects around the world: archive copies of older editions of ''CHOMBEC News'' can be downloaded from their website as PDF files.

This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.

Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked,&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For religion, behaviors often take the form of [[ritual]]s and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs. Because the religious beliefs distributed in a population are relevant to their behavioral strategies and fine-tuned by natural selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codding|first1=Brian F.|last2=Bird|first2=Douglas W.|title=Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=April 2015|volume=56|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=Lee|title=Human Behavioral Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25; 53|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.20.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; cross-cultural representations of gods and their characteristics are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.&lt;ref name="botero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botero|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Gardner|first2=Beth|last3=Kirby|first3=Kathryn R.|last4=Bulbulia|first4=Joseph|last5=Gavin|first5=Michael C.|last6=Gray|first6=Russell D.|title=The ecology of religious beliefs|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 November 2014|volume=111|issue=47|pages=16784–16789|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408701111|pmc=4250141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, religious beliefs are thought to frequently involve solutions, insofar as evolved cognitive equipment can build them, to social and natural environmental problems faced by a given population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-56025-9|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know? Supernatural Agents' Access to Socially Strategic and Non-Strategic Information|journal=Cognitive Science|date=July 2012|volume=36|issue=5|pages=846–869|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01242.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D. W.|title=Niche construction and Dreaming logic: aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=23 October 2013|volume=280|issue=1772|pages=20132297–20132297|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2297|pmc=3813344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art''' (CIHA) is an international committee that endeavors to improve [[art history|art historical]] research.

It was created in 1930 in order to develop the historical and methodological study of artistic activities and productions; to ensure permanent links between [[art historian]]s of all countries; to improve methods of art historical teaching and research; and to increase the research resources available to art historians, i.e. data bases, bibliographies, photographic and [[Iconography|iconographical]] documentation. It stimulates international meetings of art historians and co-ordinates the dissemination of information about research undertaken under the aegis of the committee. Its conferences, publications and research projects disseminate information and publicity about art historical activities world-wide.

The CIHA is currently directed by Professor LaoZhu from Peking University in China. Former director is Georg Ulrich Großmann, director of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]. Former members of the board included [[Millard Meiss]], [[Herbert von Einem]], [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]], [[Mario Salmi]], [[André Chastel]], [[Jacques Thuillier]], [[Jan Białostocki]] and many other well-known art historians.

Every four years, the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art holds a major Congress. The thirty-fourth Congress in the History of Art, organized by CIHA members, took place in Beijing, China, in September 2016. 

The [[National Committee for the History of Art]] (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art.

{{Communication}}

'''Communication studies''' or '''communication sciences''' is an [[academic discipline]] that deals with processes of [[human communication]]. There are three types of communication: ''verbal'', involving listening to a person to understand the meaning of a message; ''written'', in which a message is read; and ''nonverbal'' communication involving observing a person and inferring meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Communication and Channels|url=https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310233148/https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|website=New Charter University|archivedate=March 10, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to [[mass media]] outlets, such as [[television broadcasting]].

Communication studies shares with [[cultural studies]] an interest in how messages are interpreted through the [[political]], [[cultural]], [[economic]], [[semiotic]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[social]] dimensions of their contexts. In [[political economics]], communication studies examines how the politics of [[ownership]] affects content. Quantitative communication studies examines [[statistics]] in order to help substantiate claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Statistical Methods for Communication Science|last = Hayes|first = Andrew F.|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caffarel-Serra|first=Carmen|last2=Ortega|first2=Félix|last3=Gaitán|first3=Juan-Antonio|date=2018-07-01|title=Communication research in Spain: Weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-06|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-06|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of communication studies}}
Communication science began in earnest when students of [[Wilbur Schramm]]—the founder of the [[Institute for Communications Research]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]—namely [[David Berlo]], came to [[Michigan State University]] and founded the first General Communication Arts department in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It is still one of Michigan State's strongest programs and nationally ranked in the study of human communication.

== Scope ==
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a [[social science]], the discipline overlaps with [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Calhoun|first=Craig|date=2011|title=Communication as Social Science (And More) |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/files/ahcs/communication_as_social_science_and_more.pdf |journal=International Journal of Communication |publisher=McGill University |volume=5 |pages=1479–1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with history, philosophy, english, and cultural studies.

===In the United States===
Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Morreale|first=Sherwyn|last2=Osborn|first2=Michael|last3=Pearson|first3=Judy|date=2000|title=Why Communication is Important: A Rationale for the Centrality of the Study of Communication|url=https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|journal=Journal of the Association for Communication Administration|publisher=National Communication Association|volume=29|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235213/https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Communication Association]] (NCA) recognizes nine distinct but often overlapping sub-disciplines within the broader communication discipline: [[technical communication|technology]], critical-cultural, [[health communication|health]], [[intercultural communication|intercultural]], [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]]-small group, mass communication, [[organizational communication|organizational]], [[political communication|political]], rhetorical, and [[environmental communication]]. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include [[journalism]], [[film criticism]], [[theatre]], [[public relations]], [[political science]] (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as [[radio]], [[television]], [[computer-mediated communication]], [[film production]], and [[new media]].

=== In Canada ===
With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 [[Massey Commission]], which "investigated the overall state of culture in Canada,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/massey-commission-emc|title=Massey Commission {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and [[British Cultural Studies]], Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]. Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include [[Harold Innis]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Florian Sauvageau]], [[Gertrude Joch Robinson|Gertrude Robinson]], [[Marc Raboy]], [[Dallas Smythe]], [[Gail Guthrie Valaskakis]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6673">'''Computational musicology''' is defined as the study of [[music]] with computational modelling and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Coutinho, Gimenes, Martins and Miranda (2005): "Computational Musicology: An Artificial Life Approach", &lt;http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/computationalmusicology.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It saw its beginning in the 1950s and originally did not use computers, but more of statistical and [[mathematical]] methods. Nowadays computational musicology depends mostly on complex [[algorithms]] to either go through vast amounts of information or produce music using given parameters. Several  alternative names and subdisciplines of the field include mathematical music theory, computer music, systematic musicology, music information retrieval, computational musicology, digital musicology, sound and music computing and music informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meredith|first1=David|title=Computational Music Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-3319259291|page=v|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Lejaren Hiller]] acted as one of the foremost pioneers by creating one of the first musical compositions with a computer in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lejaren Hiller Wikipedia article, [[Lejaren Hiller]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s research continued using statistical and mathematical methods, and started to use computers in an increasing manner as their capabilities grew. 1970s and 1980s were especially significant times for computational musicology as many discoveries were made. Since then the field has suffered a general lack of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Laine, Pauli (2005): "Tietokoneavusteisen musiikintutkimuksen menetelmistä" (in Finnish)&lt;http://www.musiikkilehti.fi/1-2005/2.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Most of the work in computational musicology is done with computers that run specifically designed programs. Commonly they employ the theory and methods statistical science, mathematics and music theory. Comprehension of the physics of hearing and sound are also required in analysis of raw audio data.

== Applications ==

=== Music databases ===
One of the earliest applications in computational musicology was the creation and use of musical [[databases]]. Input, usage and analysis of large amounts of data can be very troublesome using manual methods while usage of computers can make such tasks considerably easier.

=== Analysis of music ===
Different computer programs have been developed to analyze musical data. Data formats vary from standard notation to raw audio. Analysis of formats that are based on storing all properties of each note, for example [[MIDI]], were used originally and are still among the most common methods. Significant advances in analysis of raw audio data have been made only recently.

=== Artificial production of music ===
Different algorithms can be used to both [[algorithmic composition|create complete compositions]] and [[machine improvisation|improvise music]]. One of the methods by which a program can learn [[improvisation]] is analysis of choices a human player makes while improvising. [[Artificial neural networks]] are used extensively in such applications.

=== Historical change and music ===
One developing sociomusicological theory in computational musicology is the "Discursive Hypothesis" proposed by Kristoffer Jensen and [[David G. Hebert]], which suggests that "because both music and language are cultural discourses (which may reflect social reality in similarly limited ways), a relationship may be identifiable between the trajectories of significant features of musical sound and linguistic discourse regarding social data."&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Historical-Ethnomusicology-Jonathan-McCollum/dp/0739168266 ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''] Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|0739168266}}; p.62. Some of Jensen and Hebert’s pioneering findings from 2013 on tendencies in US [[Billboard Hot 100]] songs have since been replicated and expanded upon by other scholars (e.g. Mauch M, MacCallum RM,Levy M, Leroi AM. 2015 The evolution of popular music: USA 1960–2010. R. Soc. Open sci. 2: 150081. https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150081).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this perspective, analyses of "[[big data]]" may improve our understandings of how particular features of music and society are interrelated and change similarly across time, as significant correlations are increasingly identified within the musico-linguistic spectrum of human auditory communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffer Jensen and David G. Hebert (2016). Evaluation and Prediction of Harmonic Complexity Across 76 Years of Billboard 100 Hits. In  R. Kronland-Martinet, M. Aramaki, and S. Ystad, (Eds.), [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46282-0_18 ''Music, Mind, and Embodiment'']. Switzerland: Springer Press, pp.283-296. {{ISBN|978-3-319-46281-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-western music ===
Strategies from computational musicology are recently being applied for analysis of music in various parts of the world. For example, professors affiliated with the [[Birla Institute of Technology]] in India have produced studies of harmonic and melodic tendencies (in the [[raga]] structure) of [[Hindustani classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, S., Mazzola, G., Tewari, S., Patra, M. (2014) [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319114712 "Computational Musicology in Hindustani Music"] New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[RISM|RISM's]] [http://www.rism.info/ (Répertoire International des Sources Musicales)] database is one of the world's largest music databases, containing over 700,000 references to musical manuscripts. Anyone can use its search engine to find compositions.&lt;ref&gt;RISM database, &lt;http://www.rism.info/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM) has developed the [[Mazurka Project]],&lt;ref&gt;Mazurka Project, &lt;http://mazurka.org.uk/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which offers "downloadable recordings . . . analytical software and training materials, and a variety of resources relating to the history of recording."

[[File:CILII697.JPG|thumb|200px|Inscription II 697 in the CIL: in the wall of a building in [[Cáceres, Spain]].]]
The '''''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum''''' ('''''CIL''''') is a comprehensive collection of ancient [[Latin]] [[inscription]]s. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving [[epigraphy]] of [[classical antiquity]]. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The ''Corpus'' continues to be updated in new editions and supplements.

CIL also refers to the organization within the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey.

==Aim==
The ''CIL'' collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the [[Roman Empire]], ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time—most of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the ''CIL'' is Latin.

==Beginnings==
In 1847 a committee was created in [[Berlin]] with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was [[Theodor Mommsen]]&lt;ref name="CILhistory"&gt;See the CIL site under External links below.&lt;/ref&gt; (who wrote several of the volumes covering [[Italy]]). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1853.

==Current status==
The ''CIL'' presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices.&lt;ref name="CILhistory"/&gt; The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the [[Roman Republic]]; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to [[milestone]]s. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the ''Carmina Latina Epigraphica'' (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume "Index of Numbers", correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Andreas|editor-last=Fassbender|year=2003|series=CIL Auctarium Series Nova|title=Index Numerorum|volume=Erster Band, Zweiter Band|isbn=3-11-017936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] continues to update and reprint the ''CIL.''

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

'''Digital rhetoric''' is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through [[digital media]]. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through [[multimedia]] platforms. [[Rhetoric]] combines multiple methods such as [[persuasion]], effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, G. (n.d.). What is Rhetoric? Retrieved December 3, 2014, from [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm What is Rhetoric?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal ''[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]'' holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot/article/view/242/153/|title=#DefineRhetoric 2014|work=Harlot of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===

The term digital rhetoric was coined by [[rhetoric]]ian Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, ''The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3661152.html|title=The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts|author=Lanham, R. A.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=9780226468853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, rhetorician [[Elizabeth Losh]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://losh.ucsd.edu/ Elizabeth Losh]&lt;/ref&gt; offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, ''Virtualpolitik'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Losh, E.|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtualpolitik|title=Virtualpolitik|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262123044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
# [[Public rhetoric]],  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
#  The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
# Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losh|first1=Elizabeth|title=Virtualpolitik: An Electronic History of Government Media-Making in a Time of War, Scandal, Disaster, Miscommunication, and Mistakes|date=2009|publisher=MIT|pages=47–48|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023101108/http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book ''Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice'': “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052684|language=en|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: [[digital literacy]], visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}}

===Scope of influence===
As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an [[encyclopedia]]. Teachers can use [[podcast]]s, YouTube videos, and [[social media]] sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of [[visual rhetoric]] on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities.&lt;ref name="Sparby"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparby|first=Erika|date=April 2018|title=Digital Social Media and Aggression: Memetic Rhetoric in 4chan’s Collective Identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516300810|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.

====Education====
The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, "...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J. Elizabeth|date=2010|title=The Digital Imperative: Making the Case for a 21st-Century Pedagogy|url=|journal=Computers and Composition: An International Journal for Teachers of Writing|volume=27|pages=27–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Teaching Digital Rhetoric: Community, Critical Engagement, and Application|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197069/pdf|journal=Pedagogy|volume= 6| issue =  2|pages=231–259|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.

Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceball.com/ Cheryl Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; specializes in areas that consist of [[wikt:multimodal|multimodal]] composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing [[pedagogy]]. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, ''Second Life,'' and blogs. In doing so, she managed to "engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice|last1=Eyman|first=Douglas|first2=|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-472-07268-2|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to multimodality has &amp;nbsp;also influenced ''Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing''  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.

Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.

==== Politics ====
The increase in [[Digitization|digitalization]] of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham &amp; Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

* The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. 
* The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. 
* The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Liang|last1=Jiang|title=Why context matters: the role of campaign context in the relationship between digital media use and political participation|journal=[[Australian Journal of Political Science]]|volume=52|number=4|pages=580–598|doi=10.1080/10361146.2017.1373064|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lisa M.|last1=Kruse|first2=Dawn R.|last2=Norris|first3=Jonathan R.|last3=Flinchum|title=Social Media as a Public Sphere? Politics on Social Media|journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]]|volume=59|number=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1080/00380253.2017.1383143|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, social media has shown to be  useful in the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential  election — which marked a guideline for future elections.&lt;ref&gt;Petros Iosifidis &amp; Mark Wheeler (2018) Modern Political Communication and Web 2.0 in Representative Democracies, Javnost - The Public, 25:1-2, 111-112, DOI:10.1080/13183222.2018.1418962&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people [[demographics]], behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreiss|first2=Shannon C.|last2=McGregor|title=Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=156–157|doi=10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German [[Bundestag]], he found that the types  of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and  law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz &amp; Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Stephen J.|date=December 2015|title=TWITTER AND THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF TWEETS AND MEDIA COVERAGE|url=http://sjmcconnell.com/donaldtrumptwitter/|journal=New York University, Master's Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of "values" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.

Hillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.

Jeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.

[[Digital media]] has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wendy|last2=Tinati|first2=Ramine|last3=Jennings|first3=Will|date=2018-01-05|title=From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267982/|journal=Computer|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1109/mc.2018.1151005|issn=0018-9162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

* Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list|title=A List of Twitter Handles for Members of Congress|work=Social Feed Manager|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the [[United States Senate|Senate]] side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former [[George Miller (California politician)|Congressman George Miller]], Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Rolfe Daus|date=December 2012|title=To tweet or not to tweet: Exploring the determinants of early adoption of Twitter by House members in the 111th Congress|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=49|issue=4|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.002|issn=0362-3319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[John Culberson|Representative John Culberson]] said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to [[Pew Research Center|PEW Research center]] 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_SocialMediaAndPoliticalEngagement_PDF.pdf|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=Rainie, Smith, Schlozman, Brady, Verba|first=Lee, Aaron, Kay Lehman, Henry, Sidney|date=October 2012|website=PEW Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the House of Representatives were active on twitter.
* When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/10/19/social-media-and-political-engagement/|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christine|date=July 2017|title=Introduction : Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=16|issue=3–4|pages=207–211|via=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2017.1345828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called [[Bacău|Bacau]] only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/facts-about-the-changing-digital-news-landscape/|title=10 facts about the changing digital news landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; [[Donald Trump]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

===Rhetoric to digital rhetoric===
[[Rhetoric]] is defined as the art of [[discourse]], and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maryvican.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/cicero%e2%80%99s-classical-canons-of-rhetoric-their-relevance-and-importance-to-the-corporate-workplace/|title=Cicero's Classical Canons of Rhetoric: Their Relevance and Importance to the Corporate Workplace|date=2008-04-23|website=Mary|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the [[database]], the [[hypertext]], the [[cybertext]], and other [[born-digital]] texts. [[Inventio]]n,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Delagrange, Susan|year=2009|title=Wunderkammer, Cornell, and the Visual Canon of Arrangement|journal=Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/delagrange/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dispositio|arrangement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yancey, Kathleen Blake|year=2004|title=Looking for sources of coherence in a fragmented world: Notes toward a new assessment design|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=21|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2003.08.024|url=http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813015840/http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elocutio|style]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brooke, Collin|year=2002|title=''Enculturation: Special Multi-journal Issue on Electronic Publication''|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; take on new meanings while [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]]&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; is elevated to new importance, and [[Memoria|memory]] comes to refer to textual forms like search engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Wysocki|author2=Johndan Johnson-Eilola|author3=Cynthia L.

Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology "support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration".&lt;ref name=Zappen&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zappen, James|title=Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory|year=2005|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=319–325|url=http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Vita/DigitalRhetoric2005.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15427625tcq1403_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.

===Shift from print to digital===
Dennis Baron states, "The first writing technology was writing itself." While previous writing technologies involved pencils and [[hieroglyphics]], the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, D. (n.d.)|title=From Pencils to Pixels: The Stages of Literacy Technology|accessdate=January 1, 2014|publisher=english.illinois.edu|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the [[Greek alphabet]], and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=What is Digital Rhetoric?|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebsoslgfgts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a [[technoculture]]. 
Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the "margins of literate culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bolter, J.|year=1991|title=Writing space: The computer, hypertext, and the history of writing|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Appropriation===
In the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most "contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reyman, J.|year=2013|title=User Data on the Social Web: Authorship, Agency, and Appropriation|journal=College English, |volume=75|issue=5|pages=513–532|accessdate=November 1, 2014|via=ncte.org|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CE/0755-may2013/CE0755User.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.

===Avatar===
James E. Porter defines avatar as a "virtual body".&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a "realm of ideas", there are still [[social issue]]s, such as [[gender discrimination]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Kolko"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kolko, Beth E.|year=1999|title=Representing bodies in virtual space: The rhetoric of avatar design|journal=Information Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1080/019722499128484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a "realm of ideas", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Kolko" /&gt; Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woolums, V.|date=Fall 2011|title=Gendered Avatar Identity. Kairos|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation===
[[Rhetorical circulation|Circulation]] theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated.  Henry Jenkins "sticky vs. spreadable media" applies to circulation.  Essentially, "sticky" media is media that can be spread. 
A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.

"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what [[Karl Marx]] calls a "one-sided" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001|via=|isbn=978-0-472-05268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a [[collaborative writing|co-authorship]] directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book "Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating ecologies for digital media work: The case of English studies|last=Braun|first=Chaterine, C|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is scholarship", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Catherine, C|last2=Gilbert|first2=Kenneth, L|date=|title=This is Scholarship|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/braun_gilbert/index.html|journal=Kairos|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Daren Brabham defines [[Crowdsourcing]] as, "using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Brabham, Daren. ''Crowdsourcing''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] and [[Copyright]] are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bashayr|first=A. (Et al.)|date=|title=Legal and Ethical Issues of Crowdsourcing|url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume167/number10/alqahtani-2017-ijca-914324.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery===
For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term "delivery" is often aligned with the term "performance".  The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word "hypokrisis", or "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;

===Electracy===
[[Electracy]] is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.&lt;ref&gt;''Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print'' —Gregory Ulmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, "Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of &amp;nbsp;'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Composition: Video Culture, Writing and Electracy.|last=Arroyo|first=Sarah|publisher=SIU Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0809331468|location=|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Kairos ===
''[[Kairos]],'' in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Cynthia|date=1993|title=Kairos and Kenneth Burke's Psychology of Political and Social Communication|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=291–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kairos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotles Rhetorical Situation|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/625/03/|accessdate=2018-04-22|first1=Ethan|last1=Sproat|first2=Dana Lynn|last2=Driscoll|first3=Allen|last3=Brizee|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a more modern definition expands that view to include [[Multimodality|multimodal]] texts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M. Sheridan|author2=Jim Ridolfo|author3=Anthony J. Michel|lastauthoramp=y|date=March 19, 2012|title=The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric|location=Anderson, South Carolina|publisher=Parlor Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with [[mnemonics]] (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind."&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite web|author=Burton, G. (n.d.)|title=What is Rhetoric?|accessdate=December 3, 2014|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind sharing ===
Mind sharing is a way to get [[collective intelligence]]—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing Everything|last=Zoref|first=Lior|publisher=Portfolio|year=2015|isbn=978-1591846659|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodality===
[[Multimodality]] means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies|last=Ball|first=Cheryl|last2=Charlton|first2=Colin|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Adler-Kassner|editor-first=Linda|location=|pages=|chapter=All Writing is Multimodal|editor2-last=Wardle|editor2-first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
[[Remix]] is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Virginia|date=|title=The Rhetoric of Remix|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/358/279|journal=Transformative Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern [[technology]] develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Remediation_and_Remix|title=Digital Rhetoric/Remediation and Remix - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in ''Kairos'' as "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|last=DeVoss|first=Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole|date=2009-01-15|website=kairos.technorhetoric.net|language=English|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of [[meme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

===Rhetorical velocity===
[[Rhetorical velocity]] is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as "a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ridolfo, J.|author2=Devoss, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|journal=Kairos|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual rhetoric ===
[[Visual rhetoric]] relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states "the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hocks, M.|year=2003|title=Understanding Visual Rhetoric in Digital Writing Environments|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=54|issue=4|pages=629–656|jstor=3594188|doi=10.2307/3594188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images "do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Handa, C.|year=2004|chapter=Reading the Visual in College Writing Classes By Charles Hill|title=Visual rhetoric in a digital world: A critical sourcebook|location=Boston|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.

==Controversies==

===Access===
Referred to as the [[digital divide]], issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in [[computers and writing]] circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reynolds, Thomas J.|author2=Charles R. Lewis|lastauthoramp=y|title=The changing topography of computer access for composition students|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=14|issue=2|pages=269–278|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S8755-4615(97)90027-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hea, Amy C.K.|year=2009|title=Going Wireless: A Critical Exploration of Wireless and Mobile Technologies for Composition Teachers and Researchers|location=Cresskill, N.J.|publisher=Hampton Press|pages=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright issues===
Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." Zappen's statement of "infinite" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright.  These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zappen" /&gt; 

=== Cyberbullying ===
One controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is [[Cyberbullying]].  An example can be seen in the TLC television series, [[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as "hillbillies") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Carissa|date=Spring 2018|title=The rhetoric of the real: stereotypes of rural youth in American reality television and stock photography|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sparby"/&gt;

===Legitimacy===

There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Borgman, Christine|title=Scholarship in a Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Gary|title=What are Trends in Scholarly Publishing?|url=http://www.asha.org/Academic/questions/Trends-Scholarly-Publishing/}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=MiguelAngelFimbres |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars struggle to "claim academic legitimacy" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball, Cheryl E.|year=2004|title=Show, not tell: The value of new media scholarship|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|volume=21|issue=4|pages=403–425|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2004.08.001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023081524/http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like ''Kairos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/ Kairos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harlot of the Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enculturation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enculturation.net/ Enculturation]&lt;/ref&gt; are already available through open access.

===Open access===
Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21759">'''Educational robotics''' is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy. There are many schools which are using the robot teacher. 

== Definition ==
The primary of objective of educational robotics is to provide a set of experience to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots.  The term robot here is used quite broadly and may include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles of any scale.   The rigor of the approach can be scaled based on the background of the target audience and may be suitable for students across the entire educational spectrum—from elementary school or graduate programs.

An alternate, or secondary, objective is to use robotics as a tangible and exciting application to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design.

==Education and training==

Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students. First-year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering-based coursework.&lt;ref name=MKG12&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://romisatriawahono.net/lecture/rm/survey/software%20engineering/Software%20Construction/Major%20-%20teaching%20novices%20programming%20using%20robots%20-%202012.pdf |title=Systematic Literature Review: Teaching Novices Programming using Robots |first1=L |last1=Major |first2=T |last2=Kyriacou |first3=O.P. |last3=Brereton |format=pdf |journal=IET Software |publisher=IEEE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502-513 |doi=10.1049/iet-sen.2011.0125 |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG13&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/9656489/Enhancing_Practice_and_Achievement_in_Introductory_Programming_with_a_Robot_Olympics |title=Enhancing Practice and Achievement in Introductory Programming with a Robot Olympics |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Counsell |first3=Stasha |last3=Lauria |first4=Stephen |last4=Swift |first5=Allan |last5=Tucker |first6=Martin |last6=Shepperd |first7=Gheorghita |last7=Ghinea |format=pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |publisher=IEEE |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=249–254 |doi=10.1109/TE.2014.2382567 |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives in schools===
[[File:Rero-robots.jpg|thumb|rero reconfigurable robots, designed as easy to assemble and easy to program]]
Since 2014, companies like Cytron Technologies has been making inroads into schools and learning centers with their rero reconfigurable robot.  Designed to be easy and safe to assemble and easy to program, robotics became very accessible to young children with no programming skills and even up to advance users at tertiary level.  Robotics education was heavily promoted via roadshows, science fairs, exhibitions, workshops, camps and co-sponsored classes, bringing robotics education to the masses.

===Post-secondary degree programs===
From approximately 1960 though 2005, robotics education at post-secondary institutions took place through elective courses, thesis experiences and design projects offered as part of degree programs in traditional academic disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering or computer science.

Since 2005, more universities have begun granting degrees in robotics as a discipline in its own right, often under the name "Robotic Engineering".  Based on a 2015 web-based survey of robotics educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7970162/ |title=The State of Robotics Education: Proposed Goals for Positively Transforming Robotics Education at Postsecondary Institutions |first1=Joel M. |last1=Esposito |journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine  |publisher=IEEE |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=157-164 |doi=10.1109/MRA.2016.2636375 |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the degree programs and their estimates annual graduates are listed alphabetically below.  Note that only official degree programs where the word "robotics" appears on the transcript or diploma are listed here; whereas degree programs in traditional disciplines with course concentrations or thesis topics related to robotics are deliberately omitted.

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A.

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O. (2000) Técnicas Difusas en la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental. Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Granada&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using a software tool (TDEIA).&lt;ref&gt;ARAI Research Group, Granada, Spain.

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D. Paul |last2=Emond|title=Environmental Impact Assessment|editor=John Swaigen|series=Environmental Rights in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1981 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D.

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

A wide range of instruments exist in the [[Environmental policy of the European Union]]. Among them the [[European Union]] has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web

The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 [[Aarhus Convention]], and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment] from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907140138/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ |date=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

=== India ===
The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014734/http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MCL LLC|title=Evaluation of impact on surroundings|url=http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|website=MCL LLC|publisher=Eric Firado|accessdate=1 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043929/http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J. Peyton |year=2012 |title=Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User's Guide to Best Professional Practices |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439808825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thissen and Agusdinata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thissen |first1=WIH |last2=Agusdinata |first2=DB |year=2008 |title=Handling deep uncertainties in impact assessment|url= |journal=In proceedings of the 28th annual conference of the IAIA May 5–9, 2008, Perth, Australia. |publisher=IAIA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

'''Global intellectual history''' is the history of thought in the world across the span of human history, from the [[invention of writing]] to the present. For information about the methodology of [[intellectual history]], please see the [[intellectual history|relevant article]].

In recent years, historians such as [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] have been calling for a ''global intellectual history'' to be written. They stress that to understand the history of ideas across time and space, it is necessary to study from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or global point of view the connections and the parallels in intellectual development across the world. Yet these separate histories and their convergence in the modern period have yet to be brought together into a single historical narrative. Nonetheless, some global histories, like Bayly's own ''Birth of the Modern World'' or [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]]'s ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History'' offer contributions to the huge and necessarily collaborative project of writing the history of thought in a comparative and especially connective way. Other examples of transnational intellectual histories include [[Albert Hourani]]'s ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age''.

The origins of human intellectual history arguably began before the [[invention of writing]], but historians are by definition only concerned with the eras in which writing was present. In the spirit of a historiographic project that is relevant to all human beings and that has yet to be completed, the sections that follow briefly review currents of thought in pre-modern and modern history of the world, and are organized by geographic area (and within each section, chronologically).

==Europe and the Americas==
The modern intellectual history of Europe cannot be separated from various bodies of ancient thought, from the works of classical Greek and Latin authors to the writings of the fathers of the Christian Church. Such a broad survey of topics is not attempted here, however. A debatable but defensible starting point for modern European thought might instead be identified with the birth of [[scholasticism]] and [[humanism]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both of these intellectual currents were associated with classical revivals (in the case of scholasticism, the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]; in the case of humanism, of Latin antiquity, especially [[Cicero]]) and with prominent founders, [[Aquinas]] and [[Petrarch]] respectively. But they were both significantly original intellectual experiences, as well as self-consciously modern, so that they make an appropriate starting point for this survey.

What follows below is a selective and far from complete listing of significant trends and individuals in the history of European thought. While movements such as the Enlightenment or Romanticism are relatively imprecise approximations, rarely taken too seriously by scholars, they are good starting points for approaching the enormous complexity of the history of Europe's intellectual heritage. It is hoped that interested readers will pursue the listed topics in greater depth by consulting the respective articles and the suggestions for further reading.

The intellectual history of western [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] includes:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Scholasticism]]: Associated especially with [[Aquinas]] and the [[recovery of Aristotle]], a movement that was popular in universities and provided a new way of reasoning especially in law, philosophy, theology.
*[[Humanism]]: Humanists were associated with the discipline of [[rhetoric]] but they were not just orators, they also learned ancient languages, especially [[classical Greek]] and created new knowledge about the secular past. The revival of ancient literature and philosophy was of immense importance for the further development of European thought. The first humanist is considered to be [[Petrarch]]. Later exponents of note were [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Lorenzo Valla]], and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].
*[[The Renaissance]]: A movement in the arts and letters, it is associated particularly with humanism, but also with new trends in painting and with the efflorescence of a new courtly culture that from [[Italy]] (c.1350) spread across Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries.
*[[Scientific Revolution|The New Philosophy]]: The 20th century dubbed this the [[Scientific Revolution]], but in the 17th century, the new science was more often considered to be a new way of doing philosophy. It is associated mainly with the thought of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Descartes]]. Other important philosophers were: [[Hobbes]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Advances in [[astronomy]] were made by [[Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe|Brahe]], [[Kepler]] and [[Galileo]].
*[[The Royal Society]]: A secular creation of an intellectual world led by figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christopher Wren]], [[Joseph Addison]], and [[Bishop Sprat]].
*[[The Enlightenment]]: Key developments in thought included [[Human rights|The rights of man]], [[representative democracy|political representation]], [[political economy]], [[deism]]. Notable participants counted [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[David|Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the [[Comte de Buffon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Diderot]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].
*[[The Encyclopaedists]]: The creation of central repositories of knowledge available to all outside of academies, including mass-market encyclopaedias and dictionaries: [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Ephraim Chambers]].
*[[Romanticism]] : Individual, subjective, imaginative, personal, visionary (scholarly sources [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Sidney Hook|Hook]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]).
*[[Post-romanticism]]: Reaction to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], opposes external-only observations by adding internal observations (scholarly sources [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Leopold von Ranke|von Ranke]]).
*[[Modernism]] : Rejects Christian academic scholarly tradition (scholarly sources [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]]).
*[[Pragmatism]] : Links the meaning of beliefs to the actions of a believer, and the truth of beliefs to success of those actions in securing a believer's goals. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]], [[Richard Rorty]]. Originated in late nineteenth century America.
*[[Existentialism]]: Pre- and post-WW2 rejection of Western norms and cultural values.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Edmund Husserl]]. Engaged with the intellectual prominence of fascism and socialism in Europe during in the 1930s and 1940s, which they saw needed both repudiation and study, as a way to re-establish the individual against the values of a hostile and destructive series of communities creating alienation, isolation, and individual meaninglessness.
*[[Postmodernism]] : Rejects Modernism, [[meta-narrative]] - multiple perspective, role of individual (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]]).
*[[Structuralism]] : Many phenomena do not occur in isolation but in relation to each other (scholarly sources [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]).
*[[Poststructuralism]] :[[Deconstruction]], destabilizes the relationship between language and objects the language refers to (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]).

==South and East Asia==
''Pre-Modern East Asia''

The intellectual history of China is connected to the birth of scholarship in ancient China, the creation of [[Confucianism]] with its extensive exegesis of the texts of [[Confucius]], and the active part of scholars in governments. In Korea, the [[yangban]] scholar movement drove the development of [[Traditional Korean thought|Korean intellectual history]] from the late [[Goryeo]] to the golden age of intellectual achievement in the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

In [[China]], ''literati'' referred to the government officials who formed the ruling class in China for over two thousand years. These ''[[scholar-bureaucrats]]'' were a [[status group]] of educated [[laymen]], not ordained [[priest]]s. They were not a [[hereditary]] group as their position depended on their knowledge of writing and literature. After 200 B.C. the system of selection of candidates was influenced by [[Confucianism]] and established its ethic among the literati.

Confucianism (儒家, literally "scholarly tradition") is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius is seen as the founder of the teachings of Confucianism, although he claimed to follow the ways of people before him. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious thought which has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some people in Europe have considered it to have been the "state religion" in East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucianist values and needs.

Other ancient intellectual currents in East Asia include [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]].

''Modern East Asia''

The modern intellectual history of [[China]] is considered to begin with the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in the sixteenth century. The Jesuits brought with them new astronomical and cartographic knowledge, and were responsible for new developments in [[Chinese science]]. Science in modern China has been the subject of the work of the historian [[Benjamin Elman]].

''Pre-Modern South Asia''

Indian thought is a broad topic that includes the ancient epics of South Asia, the development of what is now called [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] and the rise of [[Buddhism]], as well as many other topics relating to the political and artistic lives of pre-modern South Asia.

[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s work ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in India'' ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] is the most authoritative account of ancient Indian political ideas and institutions. It deals with the intellectual standards in ancient India in terms of political institutions.

==Africa and the Middle East==
''Pre-Modern History''

The culture of the ancient [[Near East]] and eventually of much of Africa as well was modified significantly by the arrival of [[Islam]] beginning in the seventh century CE. The history of [[Islam]] has been the work of many scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and including such luminaries as [[Ignác Goldziher]], [[Marshall Hodgson]] and in more recent times [[Patricia Crone]]. Islamic culture is not a simple and unified entity. The history of Islam, like that of other religions, is a history of different interpretations and approaches to Islam. There is no a-historical Islam outside the process of historical development.

[[Islamic thought]] includes a variety of different intellectual disciplines, including theology, the study of the [[Qur'an]], the study of [[Hadith]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For more information see the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

Classical Islamic scholars and authors include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Ali al-Masudi]]
*[[Ibn Khaldūn]]
*[[Al-Ma'arri]]
*[[Taftazani]]
*[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]
*[[Ibn Sina]]
*[[Ibn Rushd]]
*[[Ibn Arabi]]
*[[Ibn Hisham]]

[[Persian philosophy]] can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and  thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by  [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol]] invasions of Persia a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

''Modern Near and Middle East''

[[Islam and modernity]] encompass the relation and compatibility between the phenomenon of modernity, its related concepts and ideas, and the religion of Islam. In order to understand the relation between Islam and modernity, one point should be made in the beginning. Similarly, modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent phenomenon. It has historically had different schools of thoughts moving in many directions.

[[Intellectual movements in Iran]] involve the Iranian experience of [[modernism]], through which Iranian modernity and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures have been evolving since the 19th century. [[Religious intellectualism in Iran]] develops gradually and subtly. It reached its apogee during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–11). The process involved numerous philosophers, sociologists, political scientists and cultural theorists. However the associated art, cinema and poetry remained to be developed.

''Modern Africa''

Recent concepts about African culture include the [[African Renaissance]] and [[Afrocentrism]]. The [[African Renaissance]] is a concept popularized by [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] who called upon the African people and nations to solve the many problems troubling the [[Africa]]n continent.  It reached its height in the late 1990s but continues to be a key part of the post-[[apartheid]] intellectual agenda in South Africa. The concept however extends well beyond intellectual life to politics and economic development.

With the rise of [[Afrocentrism]], the push away from [[Eurocentrism]] has led to the focus on the contributions of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their model of world civilization and [[history]]. Afrocentrism aims to shift the focus from a perceived European-centered history to an [[Africa]]n-centered history. More broadly, Afrocentrism is concerned with distinguishing the influence of [[Demography of Europe|European]] and [[Oriental]] peoples from African achievements.

Notable modern African intellectual include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The so-called '''Hamburg School of Art History''' (''Hamburger Schule der Kunstgeschichte'') was a school of art historians primarily teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]], who were closely connected with the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) at the [[Warburg Haus, Hamburg]]. Its main members were scholars such as [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], who had been schooled to see images as cultural documents and inculcated in the investigation of pictorial types.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sears, "American Iconography: Assessing FSA Photographs, 1945", ''Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation'', Volume 30, Issue 3, 2014, pp. 239-254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamburg School of Art History is celebrated for the theoretical interpretations of subject matter known as [[iconography]] and [[iconology]]. It was soon established and attracted brilliant students such as [[Edgar Wind]], [[Hugo Buchthal]], [[Adolf Katzenellenbogen]], [[Walter Horn]], [[Charles de Tolnay]], [[Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich]], [[Lotte Brand Philip]], [[William S. Heckscher]], [[Klaus Hinrichsen]], [[Liselotte Müller]] and [[H. W.

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Are there broad patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any meaning?

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.

However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.

** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.

** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of India]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humanities Indicators''' is a project of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that equips researchers and policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the [[humanities]], the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/First-National-Picture-of/1437 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', "First National Picture of Trends in the Humanities Is Unveiled"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/system/inTheNews.aspx Indicators in the News].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Data from the Humanities Indicators has been widely discussed in recent conversations about a "crisis in the humanities", in light of a national decline in the number of college majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/05/analysis-finds-significant-drop-humanities-majors-gains-liberal-arts-degrees|title=Humanities Majors Drop|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=June 5, 2017|work=Inside Higher Ed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/liberal-arts-majors-are-a-dying-breed-2017-06-05|title=Liberal arts majors are a dying breed|last=Berman|first=Jillian|date=July 30, 2017|work=MarketWatch|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address questions about the workforce outcomes of humanities graduates (which are often cited as playing a role in the falling number of majors as of 2015), the Indicators issued [https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/HI_Workforce-2018.pdf ''The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond''], which examined not only their employment and earnings relative to other fields, but also graduates’ satisfaction with their work after graduation and their lives more generally. The data reveal that despite disparities in median earnings, humanities majors are quite similar to graduates from other fields with respect to their ''perceived'' well-being. The report was widely cited in the media as an important intervention in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/report-busts-myth-of-unemployable-humanities-grads/|title=Report busts myth of unemployable humanities grads|last=Long|first=Katherine|date=February 12, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/07/study-finds-humanities-majors-land-jobs-and-are-happy-them|title=Shocker: Humanities Grads Gainfully Employed and Happy|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Over-Time-Humanities-Grads/242461|title=Over Time, Humanities Grads Close the Pay Gap With Professional Peers|last=Carlson|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">An '''interpolation''', in relation to [[literature]] and especially ancient [[manuscript]]s, is an entry or passage in a text that was not written by the original author. As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.

Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, {{bracket|[[sic]]}}), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to [[forgery]] of this kind.  In the 13th century a medieval romance, the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', inserted another prose romance, the [[Vulgate]] ''Queste del Saint Graal'', in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]] through the optics of the Tristan story.&lt;ref&gt;On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'' and the ''Prose Tristan'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31.  Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a [[scribe]] made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).

Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.

Modern scholars have developed techniques{{Which|date=August 2010}} for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.

The [[Comma Johanneum]], for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as [[Christian interpolation]].

'''Kurt Aland''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (28 March 1915 – 13 April 1994) was a [[Germany|German]] theologian and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholar]] who specialized in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism]]. He founded the ''[[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]]'' (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in [[Münster]] and served as its first director from 1959–83. He was one of the principal editors of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' for the [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

== Life ==

Aland was born in [[Berlin]]-[[Steglitz]]. He started studying theology in 1933 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Berlin (he also studied philology, archaeology, and history). On 23 March that year he was examined before the ''Bruderrat'' (council of brothers) in the ''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' (Confessing Church). During his studies, he worked for the journal of the Confessing Church, ''Junge Kirche'' (Young Church). In an ideological brochure, ''Wer fälscht?'' (Who is lying?), written against [[Mathilde Ludendorff]], he confirmed the position of the Confessing Church and identified with them. In 1939 he studied for his bachelor's degree under the guidance of [[Hans Lietzmann]]. In 1940 he was released from military service; and in 1941, after Lietzmann's death, he took over the responsibilities of editing the ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' (the only German theological magazine at that time). He graduated that same year, and in 1944 was ordained as minister of the parish of [[Berlin-Steglitz]].

After [[World War II]], Aland became a lecturer on the theological faculty of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1947 he was appointed professor ordinarius in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle (Saale)]].

Aland disapproved of the Marxist government of [[East Germany]], and was persecuted as a result. In 1953 he was accused of smuggling watches to [[West Berlin]] and was kept under arrest for three months. Aland frequently spoke out against various forms of state oppression directed at churches and also demanded freedom of speech in East Germany. In July 1958, he lost his job at the university. However, in September of that year, he successfully escaped to West Berlin. His 8000-volume library was incorporated into the University Library.

In 1958 he became a professor at the [[University of Münster]], Germany. Aland rejected a professorship of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Kurt Aland - In Memoriam'', 1995, p. 15'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archive of the University of Münster/Germany''&lt;/ref&gt; In Münster he founded the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] ("Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung") in 1959, which he directed until 1983. Furthermore, he founded the world's first "[[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]]" in 1979, which was unique in the world for many years. His institute achieved worldwide recognition by publishing the ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland - Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

Aland was married twice. His first marriage was to Ingeborg Aland (they had three children together). In 1972 he married [[Barbara Aland]]. He died in [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], [[Germany]] in 1994.

Kurt Aland was representative of increasing specialism within theological-historical studies.&lt;ref name= "odin"&gt;{{Citation | first = Karl-Alfred | last = Odin | contribution = Entdecker und Wissenschaftorganisator von hohen Gnaden | title = Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | date = 28 March 1985 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of New Testament research, his work (and also the work that he did together with his wife [[Barbara Aland]] in the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in Münster) is internationally acclaimed.

The focus of his work began as an intense and adventurous search for old manuscripts on several expeditions to abbeys in Russia and Greece (amongst others). He discovered numerous manuscripts of the New Testament, whose evaluation is still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | URL = http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Horst-Koehler/Reden/2009/12/20091209_Rede2_Anlage.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 | title = Speech of the President of Germany | first = Horst | last = Köhler | date = 2009-12-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable among his work was the newly arranged edition of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (Greek New Testament) in 1979 (also called Nestle-Aland).&lt;ref name= "odin" /&gt; This textual foundation for the New Testament exemplifies a scholarly mentality aimed at achieving the highest possible convergence with the "original text."

Furthermore, he acted in the Hermann-Kunst-Stiftung, which was founded in 1964 by Hermann Kunst, a good friend of Aland. Many important figures within politics and economics participated in the sponsorship of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]].

Another priority in his life was church history, being concerned with the early church, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and movements such as [[pietism]] and revivalism.

Aland received critical acclaim for his profundity and comprehensive knowledge of the textual sources for the New Testament. His contemporary presence is relevant, having contributed to modern scientific methodology.&lt;ref name= "odin"/&gt; Aland was of the opinion that every work within historical research stands on its adherence to reliability and accessibility.

The archives (''[[Nachlass]]'') of Kurt Aland are provided in the University Archives of the [[University of Münster]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Uni Münster | language = de | URL = http://www.uni-muenster.de/Archiv/jahresbericht2014.html | title = Jahresbericht | year = 2014}}.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Massing''' is a term in [[architecture]] which refers to the perception of the general [[Shape and form (visual arts)|shape and form]] as well as size of a building.&lt;ref name=jacoby52&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Sam|title=Drawing Architecture and the Urban|location=Chichester, West Sussex|publisher=Wiley|date=2016|isbn=9781118879405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zgh0CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Born|first=George Walter|title=Preserving Paradise: The Architectural Heritage and History of the Florida Keys|location=Charleston, S.C.|publisher=History Press|date=2006|isbn=9781596291522|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifw1LxfSSGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massing in architectural theory==
Massing refers to the structure in three dimensions (form), not just its outline from a single perspective (shape).&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Arthur|title=Architectural Design Procedures|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=1999|isbn=9780415502849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttErBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massing influences the sense of space which the building encloses, and helps to define both the interior space and the exterior shape of the building.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt; The creation of massing, and changes to it, may be additive (accumulating or repeating masses) or subtractive (creating spaces or voids in a mass by removing parts of it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dietsch|first=Deborah K.|title=Architecture for Dummies|location=New York|publisher=Hungry Minds|date=2002|isbn=9780764553967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_SXC6RER-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=30-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massing can also be significantly altered by the materials used for the building's exterior, as transparent or layered materials are perceived differently.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;

It is widely accepted that architectural design begins by studying massing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyton|first=Michael|title=A generative theory of shape|location=Berlin|publisher=Heidelberg Springer|date=2001|isbn=9783540454885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8hrCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance, massing, more than any architectural detail, is what creates the most impact on the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charleson|first=Andrew|title=Structure As Architecture: A Source Book for Architects and Structural Engineers|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=2015|isbn=9780415644594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROkABAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural details or ornaments serve to reinforce massing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassie|first=Henry H.|title=Vernacular Architecture|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|publisher=Material Culture|date=2000|isbn=9780253213952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PgXZOVUVoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it has a direct relation to the visual impact a building makes, massing is one of the most important architectural design considerations.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;

A '''mating call''' is the auditory signal used by animals to attract mates. It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of [[mate choice]], in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in [[sympatric speciation]] of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment.

There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the [[larynx]] and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs.

== Vocalizations ==

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song Sparrow (8381415679).jpg|thumb|Song sparrow]]
[[File:SND 4458a.ogg|thumb|Mating call of Japanese bush warbler,  ''Horornis diphone'']]The use of vocalizations is widespread in avian species and are often used to attract mates. Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=E|author2=Kempenaers, B |author3=Matessi, G |author4= Brumm, H |title=Rock sparrow song reflects male age and reproductive success.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e43259|pmid=22927955|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043259 |pmc=3426517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfaff|first=JA|author2=Zanette, L |author3=MacDougall-Shackleton, SA |author4= MacDougall-Shackleton, EA |title=Song repertoire size varies with HVC volume and is indicative of male quality in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=Aug 22, 2007|volume=274|issue=1621|pages=2035–40|pmid=17567560|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0170 |pmc=2275172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's [[HVC (avian brain region)|song control nucleus]] (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In [[song sparrow]]s, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's "quality". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007 /&gt;

[[Japanese bush warbler]] songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamao|first=Shoji|title=Acoustic structure of songs in island populations of the Japanese bush warbler, Cettia diphone, in relation to sexual selection|journal=Journal of Ethology|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/s10164-012-0341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in [[purple-crowned fairywren]]s; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=ML|author2=Kingma, SA |author3=Peters, A |title=Male songbird indicates body size with low-pitched advertising songs.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56717|pmid=23437221|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056717|pmc=3577745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[rock sparrow]], song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012/&gt;[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|Red deer stag during rut]]

Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] bird species. In one experimental population of [[zebra finch]]es, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding.&lt;ref name="bolund2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Elisabeth|author2=Schielzeth, Holger |author3=Forstmeier, Wolfgang |title=Singing activity stimulates partner reproductive investment rather than increasing paternity success in zebra finches|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=6|pages=975–984|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1346-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger [[Bird egg|eggs]] with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females.&lt;ref name="bolund2012" /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
During the [[breeding season]], mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male [[koala]]s that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlton | first1 = B. D. | last2 = Ellis | first2 =  | last3 = Brumm | first3 = J. | last4 = Nilsson | first4 = K. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = W. T. | year = 2012 | title = Female koalas prefer bellows in which lower formants indicate larger males | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 1565–1571 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.09.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-sires and females do not vary in their body mass and can reject a male by screaming or hitting him. Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = W. A. H. | last2 = Bercovitch | first2 = F. B. | year = 2011 | title = Body size and sexual selection in the koala | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 1229–1235 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-1136-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Seddon | first2 = N. | last3 = Safran | first3 = R. J. | year = 2013 | title = Evolutionary divergence in acoustic signals: causes and consequences | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 156–66 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sac-winged bat]]s display acoustic signaling, which is often interpreted as songs. When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own.

=== Amphibians ===
Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B.

In the [[Tungara frog|túngara frog]], males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Animal communication: Complex call production in the túngara frog|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7089/full/441038a.html|journal = Nature|date = 2006-05-04|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 38-38|volume = 441|issue = 7089|doi = 10.1038/441038a|first = M.|last = Gridi-Papp|first2 = A. S.|last2 = Rand|first3 = M. J.|last3 = Ryan|pmid=16672962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common toad]], sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive mate searching in male common toads, Bufo bufo|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900708|journal = Animal Behaviour|pages = 1253–1267|volume = 27|doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90070-8|first = N.B.|last = Davies|first2 = T.R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5672/abs/274683a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1978-08-17|pages = 683–685|volume = 274|issue = 5672|doi = 10.1038/274683a0|first = N. B.|last = Davies|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer]], males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's "freezing" response to mate with the female.

In the [[Arctiinae (erebid moths)|Japanese lichen moth]], however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators.As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the "deceptive" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution of deceptive and true courtship songs in moths|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02003|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-06-20|pmc = 3687589|pmid = 23788180|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep02003|first = Ryo|last = Nakano|first2 = Takuma|last2 = Takanashi|first3 = Annemarie|last3 = Surlykke|first4 = Niels|last4 = Skals|first5 = Yukio|last5 = Ishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical calls==
Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates.

=== Crickets ===
[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|Mating call of field cricket, ''Gryllus pennsylvanicus'']]

In the field cricket, ''Gryllus integer'', males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. V. | year = 2000 | title = Crickets with extravagant mating songs compensate for predation risk with extra caution | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1444| pages = 671–675 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1054 | pmid=10821611 | pmc=1690585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = AV | year = 1986 | title = Female preferences for male calling bout duration in a field cricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1007/bf00303845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths.

Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. | last2 = Perez | first2 = D. | last3 = Lichti | first3 = N. | last4 = Yew | first4 = J. | year = | title = Temperature preferences of male field crickets (Gryllus integer) alter their mating calls | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A| volume =  188| issue = | pages =  799–805| doi=10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"/&gt; This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation.

=== Sonation ===
{{main|Sonation}}
As described in [[Sonation]], "the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates.

As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown.
[[File:Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl).jpg|thumb|Feather of male ''Pavo cristatus'' (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.]]

==== Birds ====
The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a [[drumming (snipe)|"drumming"]] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a "rattle" or "throbbing" noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, P. H. "On the "bleating" or "drumming" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis)." Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Patricia M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1915 | title = Enhanced: The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music | url = | journal = Science Online | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bustards]] are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = Juan C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = 10| pages = 1589–1600 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-0972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mirafra apiata]]'', commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maclean | first1 = Gordon L | year = 1970 | title = Breeding behaviour of larks in the Kalahari Sandveld | url = | journal = Annals of the Natal Museum | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 388–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of birds use sonation for mating calls such as manakins and hummingbirds. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infrasound in mating displays: a peacock's tale|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000391|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 241–250|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.029|first = Angela R.|last = Freeman|first2 = James F.|last2 = Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males move their feathers to produce low-frequency sonations ([[infrasound]]) and sonate more frequently in response to sonations by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Fish ====

While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In [[Gadidae|Gadoid fish]], special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Just Rasmussen | first2 = Knud | year = 1978 | title = The calls of gadoid fish | url = | journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom | volume = 58 | issue = 04| pages = 891–911 | doi=10.1017/s0025315400056848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lepidoptera ====
In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer ([[Ostrinia scapulalis]]), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takanashi|first=Takuma|last2=Nakano|first2=Ryo|last3=Surlykke|first3=Annemarie|last4=Tatsuta|first4=Haruki|last5=Tabata|first5=Jun|last6=Ishikawa|first6=Yukio|last7=Skals|first7=Niels|date=2010-10-04|title=Variation in Courtship Ultrasounds of Three Ostrinia Moths with Different Sex Pheromones|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13144|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation due to mating call differences ==

Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors.These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species.

This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research. 
[[File:Gastrophryne olivacea01a.jpg|thumb|Two ''Microhyla olivacea'' in a mating position]]

=== ''Microhyla olivacea'' and ''Microhyla carolinensis'' ===
These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the ''Microhyla olivacea'' mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of ''M. olivacea and M. carolinensis'' act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mating Call in the Speciation of Anuran Amphibians|last = Blair|first = Frank|date = 1958|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/282007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Engystomops petersi 1.jpg|thumb|

]]

=== ''Engystomops petersi'' ===
Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species.

In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the [[Reproductive isolation|behavioral isolation]] and speciation of the túngara frog (''Engystomops petersi)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual selection drives speciation in an Amazonian frog|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1608/399|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2007-02-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 1702375|pmid = 17164204|pages = 399–406|volume = 274|issue = 1608|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3736|first = Kathryn E.|last = Boul|first2 = W. Chris|last2 = Funk|first3 = Catherine R.|last3 = Darst|first4 = David C.|last4 = Cannatella|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species.

=== ''Pseudacris triseriata'' ===
[[File:Western Chorus Frog (6922520670).jpg|thumb|A Chorus Frog making a mating call]]
Several studies have shown that the species ''Pseudacris triseriata'' (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, ''P. t. maculata'' and ''P. t. triseriata,'' due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Speciation within the Chorus Frog Pseudacris triseriata: Morphometric and Mating Call Analyses of the Boreal and Western Subspecies|journal = Copeia|date = 1989-08-08|pages = 704–712|volume = 1989|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1445498|first = James E.|last = Platz|jstor=1445498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.

'''Mensural notation''' is the musical notation system used for European vocal [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term "mensural" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like ''musica mensurata'' ("measured music") or ''cantus mensurabilis'' ("measurable song") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to ''musica plana'' or ''musica choralis'', i.e., Gregorian [[plainchant]]. Mensural notation was employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, whereas plainchant retained its own, older system of [[neumes|neume notation]] throughout the period. Besides these, some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific [[tablature]] notation.

Mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called [[rhythmic modes]], which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1280}}). A much expanded system allowing for greater rhythmic complexity was introduced in France with the stylistic movement of the [[Ars nova]] in the 14th century, while [[Trecento music|Italian 14th-century music]] developed its own, somewhat different variant. Around 1400, the French system was adopted across Europe, and became the standard form of notation of the [[Renaissance music]] of the 15th and 16th centuries. After around 1600, mensural notation gradually evolved into modern [[bar (music)|measure]] (or bar) notation.

The decisive innovation of mensural notation was the systematic use of different note shapes to denote rhythmic durations that stood in well-defined, hierarchical numerical relations to each other. While less context dependent than notation in rhythmic modes, mensural notation differed from the modern system in that the values of notes were still somewhat context-dependent. In particular, a note could have the length of either two or three units of the next smaller order, whereas in modern notation these relations are invariably binary. Whether a note was to be read as ternary ("perfect") or binary ("imperfect") was a matter partly of context rules and partly of a system of mensuration signs comparable to modern time signatures. There was also a complex system of temporarily shifting note values by proportion factors like 2:1 or 3:2. Mensural notation used no bar lines, and it sometimes employed special connected note forms (ligatures) inherited from earlier medieval notation. Unlike in the earliest beginnings of the writing of polyphonic music, and unlike in modern practice, mensural notation was usually not written in a [[Sheet music|score]] arrangement but in individual parts.

Mensural notation was extensively described and codified by contemporary theorists. As these writings, like all academic work of the time, were usually in Latin, many features of the system are still conventionally referred to by their Latin terms.

The system of note types used in mensural notation closely corresponds to the modern system. The mensural ''brevis'' is nominally the ancestor of the modern [[double whole note|double whole note (breve)]]; likewise, the ''semibrevis'' corresponds to the [[whole note|whole note (semibreve)]], the ''minima'' to the [[half note|half note (minim)]], the ''semiminima'' to the [[Quarter note|quarter note (crotchet)]], and the ''fusa'' to the [[Eighth note|eighth note (quaver)]]. Very rarely, mensural notation also used yet smaller subdivisions, such as the ''semifusa'' (corresponding to the [[sixteenth note]] or semiquaver). On the other hand, there were also two larger values, the ''[[Longa (music)|longa]]'' (quadruple whole note or long) and the ''[[Maxima (music)|maxima]]'' (or ''duplex longa'', called a ''large'' in Britain), which are no longer in regular use today.

Despite these nominal equivalences, each note had a much shorter temporal value than its modern counterpart. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, composers repeatedly introduced new note shapes for ever smaller temporal divisions of rhythm, and the older, longer notes were slowed down in proportion. The basic metrical relationship of a long to a short beat shifted from longa–breve in the 13th century, to breve–semibreve in the 14th, to semibreve–minim by the end of the 15th, and finally to minim–semiminim (i.e., half and quarter notes, or minim and crotchet) in modern notation. Thus, what was originally the shortest of all note values used, the semibreve, has become the longest note used routinely today, the whole note.

Originally, all notes were written in solid, filled-in form ("black notation"). In the mid-15th century, scribes began to use hollow note shapes ("white notation"), reserving black shapes only for the smallest note values. This change was probably motivated by the change from [[parchment]] to paper as the most common writing material, as paper was less suited to holding large dots of ink.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the notes, the shapes of the rest symbols in mensural notation are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced in the course of the period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.

Ligatures are groups of notes written together, usually indicating [[melisma]]tic singing of the same syllable over several notes. Ligature forms exist only for the larger note values from the semibreve upwards. Their use in mensural notation was a holdover from the earlier [[Modal notation|modal rhythmic system]], of which they inherited some of their rhythmic meaning.

The rhythmic values of ligatures in modal notation had been based on a metric reinterpretation of the ligature [[neume]]s used since much earlier in the notation of [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian plainchant]]. In modal notation, ligatures represented stereotyped rhythmic sequences of short and long notes, typically involving groups of one or more initial short notes (i.e., breves) and one final long note (i.e., a longa). In mensural notation, this rule was generalized, with all other rhythmic combinations being classified in terms of deviation from this basic pattern. In medieval terminology, a ligature possessed ''perfectio'' ("perfection")&lt;ref&gt;Note that the term "perfection" is here used in a different sense than that of the ternary versus binary note durations. Whether any breve or longa in a ligature was itself of perfect or imperfect duration was a matter independent of the ligature forms.&lt;/ref&gt; if its final note was a longa (L), and it had ''proprietas'' ("its [normal] property") if its first note was a breve (B).&lt;ref&gt;Eggebrecht 1991: 152f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a note pair of B–L ''(cum proprietate et cum perfectione)'' could be written with the most basic of ligature shapes, those inherited from plainchant, namely the descending ''[[clivis]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the left]]) and the ascending ''[[podatus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right]]). Likewise, three-note groups of B–B–L could be written with some of the inherited ternary neumes, such as the ''[[porrectus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black porrectus.svg|x20px]], direction down–up), the ''[[torculus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black torculus.svg|x20px]], direction up–down), or the ''[[scandicus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black scandicus.svg|x20px]], direction up–up).

If, by way of exception, the first note was to be a longa, this was signaled by a reversal of its visual "property", namely the use of initial stems: the descending clivis had its downward stem removed ([[File:Mensural ligature descending LL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke]]), while, conversely, the ascending podatus had one added to it ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the left]] or [[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the right]]).

On the other hand, if the final note was to be a breve ''(sine perfectione)'', this was signaled by a change in the noteheads themselves: the descending sequence of square heads was replaced with a single diagonal beam ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=black downward rhomboid with a descending stroke on the left]]), while the ascending podatus had its second note folded out to the right ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order connected by a vertical stroke]]). Both sequences correspond to the initial B–B segments of the ternary porrectus and torculus respectively.

If both exceptions co-occurred ''(sine proprietate et sine perfectione)'', both graphical alterations were combined accordingly.

In addition to sequences of longa and breve, ligatures could also contain pairs of semibreves (but not normally a single one).&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 100 mentions some rare exceptions&lt;/ref&gt; These were called ''cum opposita proprietate'', and always marked by an upward-pointing stem to the left of the note pair.

There were also some alternate versions of the ascending ligatures. Thus, the basic ascending B–L podatus shape was replaced by one where the second note was both folded out to the right and marked with an extra stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the right]]), as if these two modifications were meant to cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The ascending L–L ''(sine proprietate)'' was modified accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Some rare variants also existed for ascending ligatures with a final breve ''(sine perfectione)'', involving a reversed form of the descending oblique stroke, either with or without an initial stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 1.svg|x20px]][[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 2.svg|x20px]]). However, contemporary theorists could not agree which of these two was supposed to be the B–B and which the L–B version (Apel 1962: 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligatures could contain any number of notes. In multi-note ligatures, the rules about initial and final values are applied in analogy to those in the binary forms. In addition, the following rules hold for notes in all positions:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any notehead with an upward stem to its left is the first of a pair of semibreves ''(cum opposita proprietate)''.
*Any medial notehead with a downward stem to its right is a longa.
*A prolonged, double-width notehead with or without a downward stem to its right is a maxima.
*Any other notehead not covered by any of the rules above is a breve.

Mensural notation distinguished between several basic metric patterns of a piece of music, which were defined as combinations of ternary and binary subdivisions of time on successive hierarchical levels and roughly correspond to modern [[bar (music)|bar]] structures. The division of the semibreve into minims was called ''prolatio'', that of the breve into semibreves was called ''tempus'', and that of the longa into breves was known as ''modus''. The division of the maxima into longas was called ''modus maximarum'' or ''modus maior''; in the modern literature it is also sometimes called ''maximodus''. Each of these levels could be either perfect (ternary) or imperfect (binary). The two types of prolatio were also known as "major prolation" and "minor prolation" respectively.

The perfect modus and maximodus became rare in practice after the 14th century. Of most practical importance were the subdivisions from the breve downwards, as by that time the semibreves rather than the breves had taken over the function of the basic counting unit. The four possible combinations of tempus and prolatio could be signaled by a set of mensuration signs at the beginning of a composition: a circle for tempus perfectum, a semicircle for tempus imperfectum, each combined with a dot for prolatio maior, or no dot for prolatio minor. These correspond to modern measures of {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|6|8}}, and {{music|time|2|4}} respectively (assuming a reduction factor of 1:4 in transcription, i.e., mapping mensural minims to modern quavers), or alternatively {{music|time|9|4}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, {{music|time|6|4}} and {{music|time|2|2}} respectively (with a reduction factor of 1:2). In each case, one breve corresponds to one modern bar. In addition, each of these basic patterns had a diminished (''diminutum'') variant, indicated by a vertical stroke through the sign ([[File:Tempus perf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus perf prol min dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]). These so-called "cut signs" indicated a reduction of all temporal values by a factor of two. (The signs [[File:Tempus impf prol min.svg|x22px]] and [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]] are the source of the modern "[[common time]]" and "[[alla breve]]" signatures {{music|common-time}} and {{music|cut-time}} respectively.) A reversed semicircle [[File:Tempus impf rev.svg|x22px]] was usually understood to be the same as [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]].

There were normally no special signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests at the beginning of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if no voice happened to have a sufficiently long rest at the beginning of the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.

==Imperfection and alteration==

The time value of some notes could change according to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed on the basis of the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift {{music|time|6|4}} (or {{music|time|6|8}}) meter.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 242f.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern notation, dotted minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was "imperfected"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve ''(brevis altera)'' to a value of two, while the first ''(brevis recta)'' kept its normal value.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two breves in m.&amp;nbsp;22 would normally imply alteration (s-l), but harmonic considerations lead most editors to assume the scribe simply forgot to add a stem to the first note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} {{audio|Sumer is icumen.ogg|play}}]]

[[File:Dufay Ave Regina cantus.svg|thumb|right|400px|Upper voice of "Ave Regina" by [[Guillaume Dufay]], a mid-15th century piece in largely homophonic tempus perfectum. Arrows are added to indicate imperfection of breves by subsequent semibreves and alteration in pairs of semibreves. Breves marked with a blue cross are perfect. Note the separator dots in the second line, enforcing a syncopated rhythm on the Sb groups. ([[:File:Dufay Ave Regina.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Dufay Ave Regina.ogg|listen}})]]

At the earliest stage, this basic principle applied only to the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with [[Franco of Cologne]], the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves,&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 344.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, with [[Philippe de Vitry]]'s theory of the [[Ars nova]], it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen on the level of breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for when and how to apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.&lt;ref&gt;The following overview is based on Apel 1962: 115–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a note was imperfected by one of the next smaller order, e.g., a breve (B) by a semibreve (Sb), and thereby lost one third of its own nominal value (ex. [a–c]). This was called "full imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad totum)''. It could be induced either backwards (''a parte post''), or forwards (''a parte ante'', ex. [c]). If both readings were possible, backwards imperfection took precedence. The smaller unit could also be replaced by a group of yet smaller notes of equivalent length, e.g., a semibreve's worth of minims or semiminims (ex. [d]). Imperfection could also apply recursively, for instance with an Sb imperfecting a preceding B and being itself imperfected by a following minim (ex. [e]), if the meter was suitable (e.g., tempus perfectum and prolatio maior).

Imperfection typically occurred if two larger notes were separated by a single smaller unit, as in a sequence of B–Sb–B–Sb. If, however, they were separated by a group of either two or three of the smaller units, there was no imperfection: in the case of two, alteration was applied instead (ex. [f]); while in the case of three the group was simply left to fill the space of a perfect unit by themselves (ex. [g]). If, in turn, there was a longer sequence of four or more smaller units before the next longer value, then the first of them induced imperfection (ex. [h]). Imperfection was barred on any note that was followed directly by another of the same order ''(similis ante similem perfecta)''. Thus, the middle part of a sequence like [[File:Mensural alteration modern.svg|x25px|alt=dotted half + quarter + half + dotted half in modern 3/4 time]] could only be written using alteration (as shown in ex.[f]); the use of imperfection like in ex.(c) was excluded, because the presence of the subsequent breve blocked it.

The normal reading of the groups could be overridden by placing a separator dot ''(punctus divisionis)'' between the notes to indicate which of them were meant to form a ternary unit together (ex. [i]). If the separator dot was placed after a potentially ternary note (e.g., a breve in tempus perfectum), it typically had the effect of keeping it perfect, i.e., overriding an imperfection that would otherwise have applied to it. In these cases it was also called ''punctus perfectionis''. Besides this, a dot could also be used in the same way as today: when it was placed after a note that was nominally binary (e.g., a breve in tempus imperfectum), it augmented it by one half ''(punctus augmentationis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 122–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, imperfection could be induced not by a note of the next smaller order but by an even smaller one. For instance, a breve in prolatio maior, which could be thought of as being composed of two perfect semibreves, could be imperfected by an adjacent minim, taking away one third of one of its two halves, thus reducing its total length from 6 to 5 (ex.[j]). This was called "partial imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad partem)''. Imperfection involving note values two orders apart (e.g., a breve by a minim, or a longa by a semibreve) was called "imperfection of an immediate part" ''(ad partem propinquam)''; while the (rarer) case where it occurred across even greater distances (e.g., between a longa and a minim) was known as "imperfection of a remote part" (''ad partem remotam'', ex. [k]). Finally, partial imperfection could also apply from both sides of a long note at once (''ad partes'', ex [l–m]). In this way, a note that was nominally 9 beats long could be reduced to any value down to 4, or a note that was 12 beats long to any value down to 7.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 118, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rests, unlike notes, had an invariable duration and could not be imperfected or altered; however, they could induce imperfection or alteration on a neighboring note.
{{clear}}
==Proportions and colorations==

An individual composition was not limited to a single set of tempus and prolatio. Meters could be shifted in the course of a piece, either by inserting a new mensuration sign, or by using numeric proportions. A "3" indicates that all notes will be reduced to one-third of their value; a "2" indicates double tempo; a fraction "{{sfrac|3|2}}" indicates three in the time of two, and so forth. The proportion 2 is usually understood to have the same effect as the use of a cut sign with a vertical stroke ([[File:Tempus impf prol min duplum.svg|x22px]] = [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]).

The use of numeric proportions can interact with the use of different basic mensurations in fairly complex ways. This has led to a certain amount of uncertainty and controversy over the correct interpretation of these notation devices, both in contemporary theory and in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Busse Berger 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of altering the metrical value of notes was coloration. This refers to the device of literally marking a note as rhythmically exceptional by writing it in a different color. In the earlier period, when normal notes were black, the exceptional ones were written in red, or sometimes hollow. In the later period, the practice was reversed; as the normal notes were now hollow, the exceptional ones were filled out in black. In either case, "colored" notes are understood to have {{frac|2|3}} of their normal duration, and are always imperfect with respect to their next smaller sub-divisions.

Coloration applied to a group of breves (ex. [a]) was known as ''color temporis'', while that of a group of semibreves (ex. [b–c]) was called ''color prolationis''. The resulting rhythmic effect, as expressed in modern notation, differs somewhat according to whether the affected notes were normally perfect or imperfect according to the basic mensuration of the music. Applied to perfect notes (ex. [a–b]), coloration creates the effect of a [[hemiola]]: three binary rhythmic groups in the space normally taken up by two ternary ones, but with the next smaller time units (semibreves in [a], minims in [b]) remaining constant. When applied to notes that were already imperfect according to their normal values (ex. [c]), coloration results in the effect of a group of triplets, with all rhythmic units reduced by two thirds.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 134f.&lt;/ref&gt; Another special form of coloration was that applied to a group of a single semibreve and a following minim, called ''minor color'' (ex. [d]). Whereas it would logically be expected to result in a triplet group ([[File:Figure rythmique noire croche en triolet.svg|x20px]]), it was instead conventionally executed as a dotted group equivalent to a dotted minim and a semiminim (note that in the context of white notation, the colored – i.e., blackened – version of the minim in the ''minor color'' group happened to look just like a normal semiminim [[File:Black mensural minim.svg|x20px]] anyway, even though nominally it was considered a different type of note.)&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of colored notes (at that time written in red) was introduced by Philippe de Vitry and flourished in the so-called [[ars subtilior]] of the late 14th century.

The example above, the chanson "Belle, bonne, sage" by [[Baude Cordier]], written in a heart-shaped manuscript, is a rhythmically complex piece of [[ars subtilior]]. It uses several notation techniques for shifting between rhythms:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 482f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*red notes: diminution {{frac|2|3}}
*shift to ''prolatio maior'': here with implied augmentation minim→semibreve
*white notes: diminution {{frac|1|2}} (two breves in the time of one)
*proportion "3": diminution {{frac|1|3}}
*proportion "{{sfrac|8|9}}": eight notes in the time of nine notes of the preceding bar

===Mensural canons===
Sometimes, music was written in such a way that the same line of music had to be performed under two or more mensuration schemes, typically leading to slower (augmented) and faster (diminished) versions of the same passage. In such cases, the music was typically notated only once, and several different mensuration signs were placed in front of it together, often supplemented with a verbal instruction of how it should be executed (called a "canon").

This technique could be applied both successively and simultaneously. Successive mensural canons were a characteristic feature of late 14th and early 15th century [[isorhythmic motet]]s. A famous example is ''[[Nuper rosarum flores]]'' by [[Guillaume Dufay]], where the tenor (notated all in longa and a few breve values) is performed first as tempus perfectum ({{music|time|3|2}}), then tempus imperfectum ({{music|time|2|2}}), then tempus imperfectum diminutum ({{music|time|2|4}}), and finally tempus perfectum diminutum ({{music|time|3|4}}), leading to length relations of 6:4:2:3 between the four repetitions.

Pieces that demanded simultaneous execution of versions of the same music, i.e., [[Prolation canon|contrapunctal canons]], were written by several composers of the [[Franco-Flemish school]] in the late 15th and early 16th century, such as [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]] or [[Pierre de la Rue]]. Ockeghem's ''[[Missa prolationum]]'' is famous for systematically exploring different ways of combining pairs of voices in mensural canons. In the example given below, from the first "Kyrie" of this mass, both upper voices sing the same notated line, one reading it as "tempus imperfectum" and the other as "tempus perfectum". The two lower voices are similarly coupled with each other. Each of the four voices thus starts the piece in a different mensuration, leading to different bar length in the modern transcription. (The lower voices, which are written in prolatio maior, later shift to a meter where all semibreves are imperfected through black coloration, which means they end up having the same length as those of the upper voices after all.)

==Pitch notation==

Whereas the rules of notating rhythm in Mensural notation were in many ways different from the modern system, the notation of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] already followed much the same principles. Notes were written on [[staff (music)|staves]] of five (sometimes six) lines, prefixed with [[clef]]s, and could be altered by [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s.

===Clefs===
[[File:Clef ranges.svg|thumb|right|377px|Clefs and their typical voice ranges]]
Mensural notation generally uses C and F [[clef]]s, on various lines. G-clefs, while used infrequently throughout the period,  did not come into completely routine use until the later 16th century. Clefs were generally chosen to match the vocal range of a given voice, so as to avoid the need of [[ledger line]]s. Since [[middle C]] lies within that range for most voices, the C-clef is the one most frequently used. For mixed voices, a typical combination of clefs would have the bass clef ([[f (musical note)|F]] on the fourth staff line) in the lowest voice, and tenor clef, alto clef and soprano clef ([[middle C]] on the fourth, third, and first staff line respectively) in the remaining voices. An alternative arrangement, known as ''[[chiavette]]'', had the range of each voice shifted one third up, leading to a combination of F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clefs.

Clefs originally bore shapes more or less closely resembling the letter they represented, but came to develop more ornamental shapes over time. In the F-clef, the two arms of the "F" were changed into two dots sitting to the right of a vertical stem. All three elements could be further modified; in particular, they were often styled as if they were note heads. The C-clef remained a simple, often square, "C"-like shape in most manuscripts, but its arms tended to become hollow rectangles or [[rhomboid]]s in later manuscripts and especially in music prints of the 16th century. The G-clef developed a curved ornamental [[swash (typography)|swash]] typically attached to the top of the letter, which ultimately evolved into the loop shape of the modern form.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidentals===

The use of [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] in medieval and renaissance music differs significantly from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the "[[b molle]]" ([[File:B molle.svg|x20px]]) and the "[[b durum]]" ([[File:B durum.svg|x20px]]). While the former was identical in form to the modern [[flat (music)|flat]] sign ({{music|flat}}), the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}) or the modern [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}), but these functions were not distinguished from each other as they are today. The ''b molle'' served to pick out the lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B{{music|flat}} as opposed to a B{{music|natural}}), while the ''b durum'' served to pick out the higher one (e.g., B{{music|natural}} as opposed to B{{music|flat}}, but also F{{music|sharp}} as opposed to F{{music|natural}}, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=accidentals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as [[key signature]]s at the beginning of a staff (one or at most two flats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=key signature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knighton|first1=Tess|last2=Fallows|first2=David|title=Companion to Medieval and Renaissance Music|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of [[counterpoint]] and [[musica ficta]].

==Miscellaneous symbols==

Mensural notation may contain a number of other symbols.

===Custos===

The custos (pl. custodes) appears at the end of the staff on or between the staff lines. It indicates the pitch of the first note that occurs on the following staff that belongs to that part relative to the clef of the current staff. This helps performers to prepare to sing the next note. If the next staff for the part occurs on the following page, two custodes may appear immediately next to each other.

===Corona===

The corona appears above the last note of the piece (or section). It is similar to the [[fermata]] in modern notation. It typically appears above the last note at each part of a piece to indicate the note should be held longer that its value indicates. If it does not appear at the end of a piece, typically a short pause is expected before proceeding with the notes after the note with the corona.

===Signum Congruentiae===

The signum congruentiae indicates the position of entry of another voice. This is used to denote [[Canon (music)|canons]]. Instead of writing out all parts, only one part is written out. The signum congruentiae indicates that when the previous part has progressed up to the point where the signum congruentiae appears, the next part should enter (from the start).

There is some variation in the way signum congruentiae are denoted.

==History==

The most important early stages in the historical development of mensural notation are the works of [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1260}}), [[Petrus de Cruce]] ({{nowrap|c. 1300}}), and [[Philippe de Vitry]] (1322). Franco, in his ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'', was the first to describe the relations between maxima, longa and breve in terms that were independent of the fixed patterns of earlier [[rhythmic mode]]s. He also refined the use of semibreves: while in earlier music, one breve could occasionally be replaced by two semibreves, Franco described the subdivision of the breve as ternary (perfect), dividing it either into three equal or two unequal semibreves (resulting in predominantly triplet rhythmic micro-patterns.)

Petrus de Cruce introduced subdivisions of the breve into even more short notes. However, he did not yet define these as separate smaller hierarchy levels (minim, semiminim etc.), but simply as variable numbers of semibreves. The exact rhythmic interpretation of these groups is partly uncertain. The technique of notating complex groups of short notes by sequences of multiple semibreves was later used more systematically in the notation of [[Music of the Trecento|Italian Trecento]] music.

The decisive refinements that made notation even of extremely complex rhythmic patterns on multiple hierarchical metric levels possible were introduced in France during the time of the [[Ars nova]], with [[Philippe de Vitry]] as the most important theoretician. The Ars nova introduced the shorter note values below the semibreve; it systematicized the relations of perfection and imperfection across all levels down to the minim, and it introduced the devices of proportions and coloration.

During the time of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school in [[Renaissance music]], use of the French notation system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern notation system.

==Modern use==

[[File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.svg|thumb|right|350px|Beginning of a modern score of a Renaissance piece, [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]]'s "Domine, ne in furore", showing the use of mensural incipits and [[mensurstrich]] layout. ([[:File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Josquin Domine ne in furore.mid|listen}})]]
Today, music from the mensural period is normally transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, bar lines and often a modernized choice of clefs. A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.

While 19th and early 20th century editions of Renaissance music often preserved the large note values of the originals, including breves and longs, most modern editions will use scaled-down note values in order to match modern reading habits regarding tempo and beat structure. For 16th century music, a frequent scheme is diminution by a factor of 2 (i.e., rendering semibreves as modern minims), in a modern ''alla breve'' bar. Older music might be diminished by a factor of 4 (rendering semibreves as crotchets) or sometimes 8 (rendering breves as crotchets). For 13th-century pieces, diminution by 16 (rendering breves as quavers) is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julie E.|last=Cumming|chapter=Motet and cantilena|editor-last=Duffin|editor-first=Ross W.|title=A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2000|pages=55, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 15th and 16th century music, bar divisions are usually chosen to match the time of a breve, while 14th century Ars nova pieces may be written in measures the length of a longa, and 13th century music in measures the length of a maxima.

To account for these editorial changes, scholarly editions often print a brief notation fragment in the original form in front of each staff at the beginning of a piece, called an "incipit", including the original clefs, mensuration signs, accidentals, and often the first few notes.&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an annotation defining the mapping scheme may be provided over the staff, e.g., "[[File:White mensural semibrevis.svg|x20px|alt=semibreve]]={{music|halfnote}}".

Where ligatures occur in the original text, this is conventionally marked by square brackets over the transcribed notes, while the use of coloration is sometimes marked by broken brackets (⌜...⌝). Flats or sharps that are not written in the original but suggested by the editor are typically indicated by placing them above the note rather than in front of it.

A special issue in representing Renaissance music is how to deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, where modern bar lines can seem to overly highlight what is part of the natural articulation points of the melodic units. To avoid the excessive use of [[tie (music)|ties]] and to allow for a notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print bar lines not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term ''[[Mensurstrich]]''), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Werner|last=Breig|chapter=Die Editionsgeschichte der ''Geistlichen Chormusik'' von Heinrich Schütz|editor-first=Helga|editor-last=Lühning|title=Musikedition: Mittler zwischen Wissenschaft und musikalischer Praxis|location=Tübingen|publisher=Niemeyer|year=2002|pages=237–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 165f.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15794">'''Misattribution of arousal''' is a term in [[psychology]] which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel [[arousal|aroused]]. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to [[fear]], people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased [[blood pressure]] or [[shortness of breath]].

One of the initial studies looking into this phenomenon conducted by Schachter and Singer (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the idea that the experience of arousal could be ambiguous and therefore misattributed to an incorrect stimulus. Operating under this assumption, the researchers developed the [[two factor theory of emotion]]. Misattribution of arousal, which is an influence on emotion processing, can be found in multiple situations, such as romantic situations and physiological responses from exercise.

An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress. A study done by White et al. (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this phenomenon and found that those in an unrelated aroused state will rate an attractive confederate more highly than a rater without arousal. The researchers also found that aroused raters would dislike an unattractive confederate more than those without arousal.

== Initial demonstration ==

=== Experiment ===
[[Donald Dutton]] and [[Arthur Aron]]'s  (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=D.G.|last2=Aaron|first2=A. P.|title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1974|volume=30|issue=4|pages=510–517|doi=10.1037/h0037031|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt; study to test the causation of misattribution of arousal incorporated an attractive confederate female to wait at the end of a bridge that was either a suspension bridge (that would induce fear) or a sturdy bridge (that would not induce fear). After the males crossed the bridge, they were stopped by a female confederate and took a [[Thematic Apperception Test]] wherein they had to compose a short story based on an ambiguous image; the image chosen was purposefully not sexual at all. Afterward, the story was analyzed for sexual content. The female confederate, who was not aware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, then gave her phone number to the males if they had any more questions about the experiment and the researchers documented how many males called the confederate. As the men finished the survey, the woman explained she would be available to answer any questions regarding her project, giving her [[phone number]] and name to the male subjects. Dutton and Aron wondered if the participants were more likely to call the woman because they were physically attracted to her or not. However, Dutton and Aron had to take into consideration that some factors of the men, such as the possibility of some men already being involved in a relationship or how an individual male interpreted the woman's body gestures.
Therefore, Dutton and Aron had the woman survey the men under two conditions:  immediately after they crossed a {{convert|450|ft|m|sing=on}}-long bridge or after they had crossed and had enough time to rest. In the first condition, the men who were surveyed during their cross over the bridge would have had their arousal level increased as they were speaking to the woman. Conditions such as experiencing winds during their walk and the nervous feeling may have contributed to their fast-paced [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]s and rapid [[breathing]].

In the other condition, the woman had approached the men after they had crossed the bridge. They had enough time to rest and get their heartbeat and breathing back to normal.

=== Results ===
More males contacted the female experimenter when they had just walked down the suspension bridge, which was thought to be due to their misattribution of their arousal (they believed that they were feeling sexual arousal at the sight of the female instead of feeling the leftover physiological arousal from the fear of walking across the suspension bridge). This was interpreted by the researchers to mean that the men found the woman more attractive when they had more anxiety about crossing the bridge. There were no significant differences on either bridge when the researchers used a male confederate to give the Thematic Apperception Test and his phone number for any further questions about the experiment.

== Subsequent research ==

=== Experiment: expansion on initial demonstration ===

Fear is not the only emotion that can be a result of misattribution of arousal. One of the earlier studies that focused on misattribution of arousal was done by Schachter and Singer in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers told the participants in their study that they were testing how their vision responded to a shot of vitamins called Suproxin. Suproxin was actually a shot of epinephrine or a placebo. Epinephrine activated the sympathetic nervous system and produced systems such as an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The researchers then either told the participants the effects of the epinephrine, said nothing about any potential effects of the epinephrine, or told them they may feel some effects that had nothing to do with the epinephrine (for example, the researchers told the participants they could experience a headache from the shot). The participants were told that they had to wait 20 min for the Suproxin to get into their bloodstreams. While they were waiting, a confederate (a participant who is also covertly collaborating with/an associate of the researchers) who was either euphoric or angry waited with the participant to see if the emotion of the participant could be manipulated by the epinephrine and the emotion of the confederate. The confederate played basketball with pieces of balled up scrap paper while in the euphoric state or had to take a questionnaire and became very angry with the personal questions in the anger state.The participants then were observed to see if they appeared to be angry or euphoric and took a self-reported survey about their mood.

They found that if someone was physiologically aroused without being aware of it, they would attribute their arousal to a recent thought in their memory.The researchers also found that emotions (in this study, euphoria and anger) could be manipulated by providing a participant with a shot of epinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: influence on confidence ===

Misattribution of arousal can also influence how much confidence one feels before completing a task. One study conducted by Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, and Gilovich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title=What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on how confidence can be affected by misattribution of arousal. Typically people feel more confident before they are supposed to do a task, but the closer they get to having to perform that task, the less confident they feel, which could be due to the arousal from the expectation of the performance. The researchers told participants that they would be exposed to a subliminal noise and were then asked if they could predict how well they would do on two tasks. After they made their predictions, the researchers either told them that the noise could make them nervous, the noise would have no effect on them, or they were told that they would not have to do the tasks until the next session a month away after they were exposed to the noise. The tasks were to unscramble anagrams or to recall as many nonsense syllables as they could after seeing them briefly. They could earn money for the tasks (more money was earned for each anagram unscrambled or each syllable correctly recalled). The participants then predicted how well they did on the tasks, and how well they believed everyone else did on the task. A second experiment replicated this first experiment.The researchers had participants attribute their arousal to noises that they heard, which resulted in those participants feeling more confident that they did well on the tasks than those that attributed their arousal to the performance anxiety from the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title='What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: polarity ===
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein generated further research on the misattribution of arousal with their 1981 study, “Passionate Love and the Misattribution of Arousal.” The researchers performed their study using two experiments. In the first experiment, 54 male participants were placed under varying degrees of physical exertion, in order to create a state of arousal. The participants were then asked to view a video of a female confederate either manipulated to be attractive or unattractive. The video was a self-disclosure statement where the female discussed hobbies and other typically dating related material. After completing the video, participants were given thirteen attraction trait criteria on which to rate the female. The experiment confirmed the researcher's hypothesis that individuals in a neutral aroused state were more likely to rate a target as attractive than an unaroused individual.
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein hypothesized that the polarity of an individual's arousal could influence the impact of the misattribution of arousal. To test this hypothesis the researchers created three separate videos to prime the subjects with a positive, negative, or neutral arousal. Sixty six male participants were asked to watch one of the videos and then rate the female as in the first study. The study found that regardless of the stimuli's polarity, the participants in the aroused state found the attractive confederate more attractive and the unattractive confederate as less attractive than the unaroused participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: conditional emotional responses ===

A study done by Loftis and Ross in 1974 looked at the effects of misattribution of arousal upon acquisition and extinction of a conditional emotional response. They conducted two experiments with 89 female undergraduates to show that misattribution procedures can alter physiological response to a conditioned source of a fear or arousal. The results suggested that self perception and attribution play a major role in emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftis|first=Jack|author2=Ross|title=Effects of misattribution of arousal upon the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned emotional response|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=November 1974|volume=30|issue=5|pages=673–682|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/614269444/|doi=10.1037/h0037414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: alternate model ===

Additionally, a study conducted by Allen, Kenrick, Linder and McCall in 1989 suggested an alternative explanation to the misattribution of arousal in terms of attraction-arousal (as there are other types of arousal that can be misattributed). The original model of misattribution of arousal essentially states that the person who is aroused will only be attracted to the target person, so long as they are unaware of the true cause of arousal.  Allen et al. propose a different model called Response-Facilitation, in which they suggest that the subject that is aroused will be more attracted to the target person (compared to people who are unaroused), regardless of if they know the true source of the stimulation. To test this new model, they ran two studies in which they manipulated the type of arousal the participants experienced and the salience (awareness) of the arousal. In one study, they put the participants into three different groups: control (no arousal), arousal-awareness (where they were put in front of an attractive person, but knew what the actual cause of arousal (exercise) was), and arousal-unaware (where they were put in front of an attractive person but didn't realize the true cause of arousal). After conducting the study, the researchers found that regardless of whether the person was aware of the true cause of arousal, they were still more attracted to the target person than those in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=J|last2=Kenrick|first2=D|last3=Linder|first3=D|last4=McCall|first4=M|title=Arousal and attraction: A response-facilitation alternative to misattribution and negative-reinforcement models|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=2|pages=261–270|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the original theory of misattribution of arousal said that people could only misattribute their arousal if they were unaware of the true cause, the Response-Facilitation model states that it is possible that people could be aware of the true cause of arousal and still find themselves attracted to someone, compared to people who are unaroused.  This demonstrates another potential model that could explain the attraction-arousal component of the misattribution of arousal theory.

The '''Modulor''' is an [[anthropometric]] [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s devised by the [[List of Swiss people|Swiss-born]] [[List of French people|French]] [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] (1887–1965).

It was developed as a visual bridge between two incompatible scales, the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and the [[metric system]]. It is based on the height of a man with his arm raised.

It was used as a system to set out a number of Le Corbusier's buildings and was later codified into two books.

==History==
Le Corbusier developed the Modulor in the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci's]] [[Vitruvian Man]], the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and other attempts to discover mathematical proportions in the human body and then to use that knowledge to improve both the appearance and function of [[architecture]].{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}  The system is based on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], the double unit, the [[Fibonacci numbers]], and the [[golden ratio]].  Le Corbusier described it as a "range of harmonious measurements to suit the human scale, universally applicable to architecture and to mechanical things".

With the Modulor, Le Corbusier sought to introduce a scale of visual measures that would unite two virtually incompatible systems: the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo Saxon]] [[Foot (length)|foot]] and [[inch]] and the French metric system.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=17}} Whilst he was intrigued by ancient civilisations who used measuring systems linked to the human body: elbow ([[cubit]]), finger ([[Digit (length)|digit]]), thumb (inch) etc., he was troubled by the [[metre]] as a measure that was a forty-millionth part of the meridian of the earth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=20}}

In 1943, in response to the French National Organisation for Standardisation's ([[AFNOR]]) requirement for standardising all the objects involved in the construction process, Le Corbusier asked an apprentice to consider a scale based upon a man with his arm raised to 2.20&amp;nbsp;m in height.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=36}} The result, in August 1943 was the first graphical representation of the derivation of the scale. This was refined after a visit to the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in Sorbonne on 7 February 1945 which resulted in the inclusion of a golden section into the representation.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=43}}

Whilst initially the Modulor Man's height was based on a French man's height of {{convert|1.75|m|ftin}} it was changed to 1.83&amp;nbsp;m in 1946 because "in English detective novels, the good-looking men, such as policemen, are always six feet tall!"{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=56}} The dimensions were refined to give round numbers and the overall height of the raised arm was set at 2.262&amp;nbsp;m.

Of the works leading to the creation of the Modulor, Robin Evans notes that the female body "was only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony".{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}

==Promotion==
On the 10 January 1946, Le Corbusier on a visit to New York met with [[Henry J. Kaiser]], an American industrialist whose [[Kaiser Shipyard]] had built [[Liberty ship|Liberty Ships]] during [[World War II]]. Kaiser's project was to build ten thousand new houses a day, but he had changed his mind and decided to build cars instead.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=52}} During the interview, Le Corbusier sympathised with Kaiser's problems of coordinating the adoption of equipment between the American and British armies because of the differences in units of length and promoted his own ''harmonious scale''.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=115}}

On the same trip he met with [[David E. Lilienthal]] of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to promote the use of his ''harmonious scale'' on further civil engineering projects.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=53}}

He also applied the principle of the Modulor to the efficient design of distribution crates in post war France.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=122}}

==Graphic representation==
The graphic representation of the Modulor, a stylised human figure with one arm raised, stands next to two vertical measurements, a red series based on the figure's navel height (1.08&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 1.13&amp;nbsp;m in the revised version) then segmented according to [[Phi]], and a blue series based on the figure's entire height, double the navel height (2.16&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 2.26&amp;nbsp;m in the revised), segmented similarly.  A [[spiral]], graphically developed between the red and blue segments, seems to mimic the volume of the human figure.

The Modulor 2 was drawn by [[André Maissonier]] and [[Justino Serralta]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Nudelman, [http://www.farq.edu.uy/patio/institucion/en-recuerdo.html "En recuerdo: Justino Serralta, 'arquitecto de comunidades', 1919–2011"], ''Boletín Facultad de Arquitectura UDELAR'' (30 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical application==
Le Corbusier used his Modulor scale in the design of many [[Le Corbusier#Key buildings|buildings]], including:

===Unité d'Habitation à Marseille===

In his first book on the subject ''The Modulor'', Le Corbusier has a chapter on the use of the modular in the [[Unité d'Habitation]]. The modular governs: the plan, section and elevations; the [[Brise soleil|brise-soleil]]; the roof; the supporting columns and the plan and section of the apartments. It was also used for the dimensions of the commemorative stone laid on 14 October 1947.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=131}} A version of the Modulor Man was [[casting|cast]] in [[concrete]] near the entrance.

===Church of Sainte Marie de La Tourette===

In the Church of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] Le Corbusier floors the majority of the church in pale concrete panels set to Modulor dimensions.{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=62}} Also, the engineer [[Iannis Xenakis]] applied the Modulor system to the design of the exterior vertical ventilators or "ondulatoires".{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=83}}

===Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts===

In the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts|Carpenter Center]] the Modulor system was used for the brise-soleil distances, the floor to floor heights, the bay distances and the column thicknesses.{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=158}} Le Corbusier conceived that the dimensioning of the entrance ramp would be "''visible essay on the mathematics of the human body''".{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=182}}

==Publication==
Le Corbusier published ''Le Modulor'' in 1948, followed by ''Modulor 2'' in 1955.  These works were first published in English as ''The Modulor'' in 1954 and ''Modulor 2 (Let the User Speak Next)'' in 1958.

The 2004 reprinted box set including both books was printed in a square format using the Modulor with the series twenty seven to one hundred and forty reduced in size to one tenth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=back cover}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12429">Throughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject.

==Early 20th century==

Apart from the work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century, that was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject, the first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="valdes"&gt;Valdés Cantero, Alicia, Determined women ready to succeed. The ''International Journal of Cuban Studies'', 2 December 2008. http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/i18088_3.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] (b. 1881) or composer [[Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes]] (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando. Africanía de la Música Folklórica de Cuba. Editora Universitaria, La Habana, Cuba. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another important personality, María Muñoz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal “Musicalia” and founded the Havana Choral Society.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P.145&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the [[Havana University]] from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as [[María Teresa Linares Savio]] (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

One of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in [[Cuba]] was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer [[Eliseo Grenet]].
 
Emilio Grenet was born in [[Havana]] in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied [[Sight-reading]] and [[Music theory]] with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in [[New York City]] in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer [[Joaquín Turina]] who introduced him to his professor of [[Harmony]], [[Conrado del Campo]].

Grenet returned again to [[Cuba]] where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to [[New York City]] to record with the orchestra of his brother [[Eliseo Grenet]]. He taught [[Musical composition]] to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique González Mántici and [[Harmony]] to the composer and guitarist Vicente González Rubiera ([[Guyún]]).

In 1939, Grenet published his important work "Cuban popular music", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in [[Cuba]], from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Grenet. EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Emilio_Grenet. Retrieved: 07-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1940s and 1950s==

[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|right|100px|&lt;center&gt;Alejo Carpentier.]]
In 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist [[Alejo Carpentier]] (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work “La música en Cuba” (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known “Son de la Mateodora” and the “Cuban Contradanza”, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before.
 
Coincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as [[Argeliers León]] (b. 1918) and Hilario González (b. 1920) were diligently working along with [[José Ardévol]]  at “Grupo de Renovación Musical” to improve and renovate  the Cuban musical panorama.&lt;ref&gt;EcuRed. Grupo de Renovación Musical. http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Grupo_de_Renovaci%C3%B3n_Musical&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[Argeliers León]] continued offering the musicology summer courses started by María Muñoz and [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs “Cancionero Infantil de Hispanoamérica.” Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were María Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and [[Lydia Cabrera]], an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

==Post revolutionary period (1959)==

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hernández Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feliú Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the “Ethnographic Atlas of Cuba,” which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;


[[Argeliers León]] and his wife María Teresa Linares were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, León was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the José Martí National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Américas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in “generic complexes” to study the musical styles in Cuba.&lt;ref name="orovio"&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

María Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

During the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the José Martí National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The “Son de la Ma Teodora” origins. In his famous book “La música en Cuba”, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition.  In a brilliant article about this subject: “Teodora Ginés: ¿Mito o realidad histórica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

In turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the “Contradanza Cubana”. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: “Aportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.”  &lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés. Panorama de la Música Popular Cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1995. P. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members of this generation are: Cristóbal Díaz Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Cañizares (b. 1936), Raul Martínez Rodríguez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radamés Giro (b. 1940), [[Danilo Orozco]] (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944).&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

==The second generation (1970s) and beyond==

The members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;
From this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).

[[File:Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández, musicólogo, violonchelista y profesor cubano.]]
Two other important musicologists from this generation are: [[Alberto Alén Pérez]]  (b. 1948) and [[Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández]] (b. 1947). Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: “La forma de las formas musicales” and “Diagnosticar la musicalidad”. Rolando Pérez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: “Proceso de binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina (1987).”&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

Olavo Alén (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers León in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded León's theory of “generic complexes”, in works such as: “Géneros de la música cubana” from 1976.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt; 

Those theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article “De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones”: 

{{Cita|“Fortunately, the theology [sic] of generic complexes has been viewed with skepticism in musicological circles of several countries, including Cuba, where quite a few musicologists have oscillated [in his opinion]&lt;ref&gt;Note by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt;between rejection, disbelief and disdain …” &lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo. De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones. Clave. Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. Año 4, No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Other members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jesús Gómez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956).

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the humanities:

'''[[Humanities]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[speculative philosophy|speculative]], as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[Science|natural sciences]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What types of thing are the humanities? ==

The humanities can be described as all of the following:
* a branch of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is a field of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* study of the [[human condition]] &amp;ndash; unique and inescapable features of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.
** [[Theatre]] ([[Outline of theatre|outline]]) &amp;ndash; collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place.
** [[Music]] ([[Outline of music|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form the medium of which is sound and silence.
** [[Opera]] ([[List of opera topics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Stagecraft]] ([[Outline of stagecraft|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).
* [[Linguistics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of linguistics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of natural languages.
* [[Psychology]] &amp;nbsp; research of psychological pathology and therapeutic treatments separate from, but complementary to, [[Psychiatry|psychiatric medicine]]
* [[Sociology]] &amp;nbsp; study of social interaction between and among groups of people
* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.

=== Interdisciplinary humanities ===
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary approach to studying a geographic area.
* [[Ecological humanities]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the humanities over the past several decades (in particular environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology).

'''Palaeography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|UK]]) or '''paleography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|US]]; ultimately from {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|παλαιός}}}}, ''palaiós'', "old", and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|γράφειν}}}}, ''graphein'', "to write") is the study of ancient and historical [[handwriting]] (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing; not the textual content of documents). Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;'Palaeography', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiceducationproject.org/legacy/projects/paleography/index.html |title=Latin Palaeography Network |publisher=Civiceducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts. However, it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision.

== Application ==
Palaeography can be an essential skill for [[historian]]s and [[philology|philologists]], as it tackles two main difficulties. First, since the style of a single [[alphabet]] in each given language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual characters as they existed in various eras. Second, [[scribe]]s often used many [[abbreviation]]s, usually so as to write more quickly and sometimes to save space, so the specialist-palaeographer must know how to interpret them. Knowledge of individual [[Letterform|letter-forms]], [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], [[punctuation]], and [[abbreviation]]s enables the palaeographer to read and understand the text. The palaeographer must know, first, the language of the text (that is, one must become expert in the relevant earlier forms of these languages); and second, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal or [[notary|notarial]] abbreviations. [[Philology|Philological knowledge]] of the language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time or place can help palaeographers identify ancient or more recent [[forgeries]] versus authentic documents.

Knowledge of [[writing material]]s is also essential to the study of handwriting and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced.&lt;ref name=fn_3&gt;Robert P. Gwinn, "Paleography" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], [[Micropædia]], Vol. IX, 1986, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin: this is why the palaeographer must take into account the style and formation of the manuscript and the handwriting used in it.&lt;ref name=fn_4&gt;Fernando De Lasala, ''Exercise of Latin Paleography'' ([[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University of Rome]], 2006) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Document dating ===
Palaeography can be used to provide information about the date at which a document was written. However, "paleography is a last resort for dating" and, "for book hands, a period of 50 years is the least acceptable spread of time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Eric G. |year=1987 |title=Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Institute of Classical Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nongbri24"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |last=Nongbri |first=Brent |year=2005 |title=The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel |journal=Harvard Theological Review |volume=98 |pages=23–48 (24) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216200012/http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being suggested that "the 'rule of thumb' should probably be to avoid dating a hand more precisely than a range of at least seventy or eighty years".&lt;ref name="nongbri24" /&gt; In a 2005 e-mail addendum to his 1996 "The Paleographical Dating of P-46" paper Bruce W. Griffin stated "Until more rigorous methodologies are developed, it is difficult to construct a 95% confidence interval for [[New Testament|NT]] manuscripts without allowing a century for an assigned date."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Bruce W.

Scholars also tend to oversimplify diachronic development, assuming models of simplicity rather than complexity".&lt;ref name="Schniedewind, William M. 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schniedewind |first=William M. |authorlink=William Schniedewind |year=2005 |chapter=Problems of Paleographic Dating of Inscriptions |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Levy |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Higham |title=The Bible and Radiocarbon Dating: Archaeology, Text and Science |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-84553-057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aramaic palaeography ==
[[File:Mandaic Alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Table showing the [[Mandaic alphabet]] (Abagada) with some of the mysteries represented by the letters]]

The [[Aramaic language]] was the international trade language of the [[Ancient Middle East]], originating in what is modern-day [[Syria]], between 1000 and 600&amp;nbsp;BC. It spread from the [[Mediterranean coast]] to the borders of [[India]], becoming extremely popular and being adopted by many people, both with or without any previous writing system. The [[Aramaic script]] was written in a [[Abjad|consonantal form]] with a direction from right to left. The [[Aramaic alphabet]], a modified form of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], was the ancestor of the [[Arabic alphabet|modern Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s, as well as the [[Brāhmī script]], the parent writing system of most modern [[abugida]]s in [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Tibet]], and [[Mongolia]]. Initially, the Aramaic script did not differ from the Phoenician, but then the [[Aramaeans]] simplified some of the letters, thickened and rounded their lines: a specific feature of its letters is the distinction between '''d''' and '''r'''. One innovation in Aramaic is the ''[[matres lectionis]]'' system to indicate certain vowels. Early Phoenician-derived scripts did not have letters for vowels, and so most texts recorded just consonants. Most likely as a consequence of phonetic changes in North Semitic languages, the Aramaeans reused certain letters in the alphabet to represent long vowels. The letter ''[[aleph]]'' was employed to write /'''ā'''/, ''he'' for /'''ō'''/, ''yod'' for /'''ī'''/, and ''vav'' for /'''ū'''/.

Aramaic writing and language supplanted [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] [[cuneiform]] and [[Akkadian language]], even in their homeland in [[Mesopotamia]]. The wide diffusion of Aramaic letters led to its writing being used not only in monumental inscriptions, but also on [[papyrus]] and [[potsherds]]. Aramaic papyri have been found in large numbers in Egypt, especially at [[Elephantine papyri|Elephantine]]—among them are official and private documents of the [[Jewish military history|Jewish military settlement]] in 5&amp;nbsp;BC. In the Aramaic papyri and potsherds, words are separated usually by a small gap, as in modern writing. At the turn of the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, the heretofore uniform Aramaic letters developed new forms, as a result of dialectal and political fragmentation in several subgroups. The most important of these is the so-called [[Hebrew square script|square Hebrew block script]], followed by [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]], [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], and the much later [[Syriac script]].

Aramaic is usually divided into three main parts:&lt;ref name="Bey" /&gt;
# Old Aramaic (in turn subdivided into Ancient, Imperial, Old Eastern and Old Western Aramaic)
# Middle Aramaic, and
# Modern Aramaic of the present day.

The term Middle Aramaic refers to the form of Aramaic which appears in pointed texts and is reached in the 3rd century AD with the loss of short unstressed vowels in open syllables, and continues until the triumph of [[Arabic]].

Old Aramaic appeared in the 11th century BC as the official language of the first [[Syro-Hittite states|Aramaean states]]. The oldest witnesses to it are inscriptions from northern [[Syria]] of the 10th to 8th centuries BC, especially extensive state treaties (c. 750 BC) and royal inscriptions. The early Old Ancient should be classified as "Ancient Aramaic" and consists of two clearly distinguished and standardised written languages, the Early Ancient Aramaic and the Late Ancient Aramaic. Aramaic was influenced at first principally by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], then from the 5th century BC by [[Persian language|Persian]] and from the 3rd century BC onwards by [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], especially in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bey"&gt;Cf. Klaus Beyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZ53zpMQNLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Aramaic Language''], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986, pp. 9- 15; Rainer Degen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nrRcQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Altaramäische Grammatik der Inschriften des 10-8 Jh.v.Chr.''], [[Wiesbaden]], repr. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; As Aramaic evolved into the imperial language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], the script used to write it underwent a change into something more cursive. The best examples of this script come from documents written on papyrus from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;This script was also used during the reign of King [[Ashoka]] in his edicts to spread early [[Buddhism]]. Cf. [http://www.ancientscripts.com/aramaic.html "Ancient Scripts: Aramaic"]. Accessed 05/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 BC, [[Darius I]] (522–486) made the Aramaic used by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid imperial administration]] into the official language of the western half of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This so-called "Imperial Aramaic" (the oldest dated example, from Egypt, belonging to 495 BC) is based on an otherwise unknown written form of Ancient Aramaic from [[Babylonia]]. In orthography, Imperial Aramaic preserves historical forms—[[alphabet]], [[orthography]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]] and [[Style (sociolinguistics)|style]] are highly standardised. Only the formularies of the private documents and the [[Ahiqar|Proverbs of Ahiqar]] have maintained an older tradition of sentence structure and style. Imperial Aramaic immediately replaced Ancient Aramaic as a written language and, with slight modifications, it remained the official, commercial and literary language of the [[Near East]] until gradually, beginning with the fall of the Persian Empire (331 BC) and ending in the 4th century AD, it was replaced by Greek, Persian, the eastern and western dialects of Aramaic and Arabic, though not without leaving its traces in the written form of most of these. In its original Achaemenid form, Imperial Aramaic is found in texts of the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. These come mostly from Egypt and especially from the [[Jewish temple at Elephantine#Jewish temple at Elephantine|Jewish military colony]] of [[Elephantine]], which existed at least from 530 to 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Greek palaeography ==
{{See also|History of the Greek alphabet}}

A history of Greek handwriting must be incomplete owing to the fragmentary nature of evidence. If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of {{small caps|[[epigraphy]]}}, we are practically dependent for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD on the [[papyri]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (cf. {{small caps|[[papyrology]]}}), the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few [[manuscript]]s not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from [[Avroman]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. E. H. Minns, ''Journ. of Hell. Stud.'', xxxv, pp.22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''New Pal. Soc.'', ii, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Herculaneum papyri]], and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]]; but some differences can be discerned, and it is probable that, were there more material, distinct local styles could be traced.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;In creating and expanding the following sections on {{small caps|Greek palaeography}}—inclusive of the "Vellum and Paper Manuscripts" subsection—specialist sources have been consulted and thoroughly perused for the relevant text and citations, as follows: primarily the article on ''general palaeography'' by renowned [[United Kingdom|British]] [[papyrology|papyrologist]] and scholar Sir [[Harold Idris Bell]], present in  {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Palaeography#Greek Writing I|display=Palaeography § Greek Writing}} |volume=20 |pages=557–567}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/557/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; [[Barry B.

These texts will be referred to throughout the present article with relevant inline citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, any given period several types of hand may exist together. There was a marked difference between the hand used for literary works (generally called "[[uncials]]" but, in the [[papyrus]] period, better styled "book-hand") and that of documents ("[[cursive]]") and within each of these classes several distinct styles were employed side by side; and the various types are not equally well represented in the surviving papyri.

The development of any hand is largely influenced by the materials used. To this general rule the Greek script is no exception. Whatever may have been the period at which the use of papyrus or leather as a writing material began in Greece (and papyrus was employed in the 5th century BC), it is highly probable that for some time after the introduction of the [[alphabet]] the characters were incised with a sharp tool on stones or metal far oftener than they were written with a pen. In cutting a hard surface, it is easier to form angles than curves; in writing the reverse is the case; hence the development of writing was from angular letters ("capitals") inherited from [[epigraphy|epigraphic style]] to rounded ones ("uncials"). But only certain letters were affected by this development, in particular '''E''' (uncial '''ε'''), '''Σ''' ('''c'''), '''Ω''' ('''ω'''), and to a lesser extent '''A''' ('''α''').

=== Ptolemaic period ===
[[File:P.Berol. inv. 9875 col. v coronis.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Berlin]] papyrus 9875 showing the 5th column of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus']] ''Persae'', with a [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]] symbol to mark the end.]]

The earliest Greek papyrus yet discovered is probably that containing the ''Persae'' of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus]], which dates from the second half of the 4th century BC and its script has a curiously archaic appearance. '''E''', '''Σ''', and '''Ω''' have the capital form, and apart from these test letters the general effect is one of stiffness and angularity.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Timotheus' poetry survive, published in T. Bergk, ''Poetae lyrici graeci''. The cit. papyrus-fragment of his ''Persae (Persians)'' was discovered at [[Abusir]] and has been edited by [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], ''Der Timotheos-Papyrus gefunden bei Abusir am 1. Februar 1902'', Leipzig: Hinrichs (1903), with content discussion. Cf. V. Strazzulla, ''Persiani di Eschilo ed il nomo di Timoteo'' (1904); S. Sudhaus in ''Rhein. Mus.'', iviii. (1903), p. 481; and T. Reinach and M. Croiset in ''Revue des etudes grecques'', xvi. (1903), pp. 62, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; More striking is the hand of the earliest dated papyrus, a contract of 311 BC. Written with more ease and elegance, it shows little trace of any development towards a truly [[cursive]] style; the letters are not linked, and though the uncial '''c''' is used throughout, '''E''' and '''Ω''' have the capital forms. A similar impression is made by the few other papyri, chiefly literary, dating from about 300 BC; '''E''' may be slightly rounded, '''Ω''' approach the uncial form, and the angular '''Σ''' occurs as a letter only in the Timotheus papyrus, though it survived longer as a numeral (= 200), but the hands hardly suggest that for at least a century and a half the art of writing on papyrus had been well established. Yet before the middle of the 3rd century BC, one finds both a practised book-hand and a developed and often remarkably handsome cursive.

These facts may be due to accident, the few early papyri happening to represent an archaic style which had survived along with a more advanced one; but it is likely that there was a rapid development at this period, due partly to the opening of Egypt, with its supplies of papyri, and still more to the establishment of the great [[Alexandrian Library]], which systematically copied literary and scientific works, and to the multifarious activities of [[Hellenistic]] bureaucracy. From here onward, the two types of script were sufficiently distinct (though each influenced the other) to require separate treatment. Some literary papyri, like the roll containing [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', were written in cursive hands, and, conversely, the book-hand was occasionally used for documents. Since the scribe did not date literary rolls, such papyri are useful in tracing the development of the book-hand.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The documents of the mid-3rd century BC show a great variety of [[cursive]] hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]], the finance minister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]], to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestianian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the [[Chancery hand]] of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. '''H''', with the cross-stroke high, '''Π''', '''Μ''', with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, '''Υ''', and '''Τ''', with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than to the right of the up-stroke, '''Γ''' and '''Ν''', whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; '''ε''', '''c''', '''θ''' and '''β''', which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; '''ω''' is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.

[[File:The Derveni Papyrus.jpg|thumb|The [[Derveni Papyrus]], a Greek Macedonian philosophical text dating around 340 BC, considered Europe's oldest manuscript]]

Besides these hand of Chancery type, there are numerous less elaborate examples of cursive, varying according to the writer's skill and degree of education, and many of them strikingly easy and handsome.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In some cursiveness is carried very far, the linking of letters reaching the point of illegibility, and the characters sloping to the right. '''A''' is reduced to a mere acute angle (&lt;big&gt;'''∠'''&lt;/big&gt;), '''T''' has the cross-stroke only on the left, '''ω''' becomes an almost straight line, '''H''' acquires a shape somewhat like &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt;, and the last stroke of '''N''' is extended far upwards and at times flattened out until it is little more than a diagonal stroke to the right. The attempt to secure a horizontal line along the top is here abandoned. This style was not due to inexpertness, but to the desire for speed, being used especially in accounts and drafts, and was generally the work of practised writers. How well established the cursive hand had now become is shown in some wax tablets of this period, the writing on which, despite the difference of material, closely resemble the hands of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Wax tablets of this period are preserved at the [[University College London]], cf. ''Speaking in the Wax Tablets of Memory'', Agocs, PA (2013). In: Castagnoli, L. and Ceccarelli, P, (eds.), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents of the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BC show, perhaps partly by the accident of survival (there is nothing analogous to the Apollonius letters, a loss of breadth and spaciousness. In the more formal types the letters stand rather stiffly upright, often without the linking strokes, and are more uniform in size; in the more cursive they are apt to be packed closely together. These features are more marked in the hands of the 2nd century. The less cursive often show am approximation to the book-hand, the letters growing rounder and less angular than in the 3rd century; in the more cursive linking was carried further, both by the insertion of coupling strokes and by the writing of several letters continuously without raising the pen, so that before the end of the century an almost current hand was evolved. A characteristic letter, which survived into the early Roman period, is '''T''', with its cross-stroke made in two portions (variants:[[File:Greek cursive variants Tau.svg|70px]]). In the 1st century, the hand tended, so far as can be inferred from surviving examples, to disintegrate; one can recognise the signs which portend a change of style, irregularity, want of direction, and the loss of the feeling for style. A fortunate accident has preserved two Greek [[parchment]]s written in [[Parthia]], one dated 88 BC, in a practically unligatured hand, the other, 22/21 BC, in a very cursive script of Ptolemaic type; and though each has non-Egyptian features the general character indicates a uniformity of style in the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The development of the Ptolemaic book-hand is difficult to trace, as there are few examples, mostly not datable on external grounds. Only for the 3rd century BC have we a secure basis. The hands of that period have an angular appearance; there is little uniformity in the size of individual letters, and though sometimes, notably in the [[Flinders Petrie|Petrie papyrus]] containing the ''[[Phaedo]]'' of [[Plato]], a style of considerable delicacy is attained, the book-hand in general shows less mastery than the contemporary cursive. In the 2nd century the letters grew rounder and more uniform in size, but in the 1st century there is perceptible, here as in the cursive hand, a certain disintegration. Probably at no time did the Ptolemaic book-hand acquire such unity of stylistic effect as the cursive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lewis Campbell, "On the Text of the Papyrus Fragment of the Phaedo", ''Classical Review'', Volume 5, Issue 10, December 1891, pp. 454–457, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3766440 published online: 27 October 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman period ===
[[File:HARRIS HOMER - 1st CENTURY B.C..JPG|thumb|left|Greek papyrus with [[Homer]]'s verses, 1st century BC]]

Papyri of the Roman period are far more numerous and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken appearance, part of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign (=&lt;big&gt;⅛&lt;/big&gt;) is '''η''' in the shape [[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]. By the end of the 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the [[Chancery hand]], with tall and laterally compressed letters, '''ο''' very narrow and '''α''' and '''ω''' often written high in the line. This style, from at least the latter part of the 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.

[[File:Herculanean Rolls - Papyrus 157-152.JPG|thumb|Copy of Herculanean Rolls, Greek papyrus 157–152]]

Several different types of book-hand were used in the Roman period. Particularly handsome{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} is a round, upright hand seen, for example, in a [[British Museum]] papyrus containing ''[[Odyssey]]'' III. The cross-stroke of '''ε''' is high, '''Μ''' deeply curved and '''Α''' has the form '''α'''. Uniformity of size is well attained, and a few strokes project, and these but slightly, above or below the line. Another type, well called by palaeographer Schubart the "severe" style, has a more angular appearance and not infrequently slopes to the right; though handsome, it has not the sumptuous appearance of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wilhelm Schubart, ''Griechische Palaeographie'', C.H. Beck, 1925, vol. i, pt. 4; also 1st half of new ed. of Muller's ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft''; and Schubart's ''Das Buch bei den Griechen und Römern'' (2nd ed.); ''ibid.'', ''Papyri Graecae Berolinenses'' (Boon, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; There are various classes of a less pretentious style, in which convenience rather than beauty was the first consideration and no pains were taken to avoid irregularities in the shape and alignment of the letters. Lastly may be mentioned a hand which is of great interest as being the ancestor of the type called (from its later occurrence in [[vellum]] codices of the [[Bible]]) the biblical hand. This, which can be traced back at least the late 2nd century, has a square, rather heavy appearance; the letters, of uniform size, stand upright, and thick and thin strokes are well distinguished. In the 3rd century the book-hand, like the cursive, appears to have deteriorated in regularity and stylistic accomplishment.

In the charred rolls found at [[Herculaneum]] and dating from about the beginning of our era, are specimens of Greek literary hands from outside Egypt; and a comparison with the Egyptian papyri reveals great similarity in style and shows that conclusions drawn from the henads of Egypt may, with caution, be applied to the development of writing in the Greek world generally.

=== Byzantine period ===
{{See also|Byzantine text-type}}
[[File:Codex Alexandrinus 1 Tim 3,16.jpg|thumb|left|Section of the [[Codex Alexandrinus]], the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the [[Gospels]].]]
The cursive hand of the 4th century shows some uncertainty of character. Side by side with the style founded on the [[Chancery hand]], regular in formation and with tall and narrow letters, which characterised the period of [[Diocletian]], and lasted well into the century, we find many other types mostly marked by a certain looseness and irregularity. A general progress towards a florid and sprawling hand is easily recognisable, but a consistent and deliberate style was hardly evolved before the 5th century, from which unfortunately few dated documents have survived. [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] cursive tends to an exuberant hand, in which the long strokes are excessively extended and individual letters often much enlarged. But not a few hands of the 5th and 6th centuries are truly handsome and show considerable technical accomplishment. Both an upright and a sloping type occur and there are many less ornamental hands, but there gradually emerged towards the 7th century two general types, one (especially used in letters and contracts) a current hand, sloping to the right, with long strokes in such characters at '''τ''', '''ρ''', '''ξ''', '''η''' (which has the &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt; shape), '''ι''', and '''κ''', and with much linking of letters, and another (frequent in accounts), which shows, at least in essence, most of the forms of the later minuscule. (cf. [[#Minuscule Hand|below]].) This is often upright, though a slope to the right is quite common, and sometimes, especially in one or two documents of the early [[Arabic alphabet|Arab]] period, it has an almost [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] effect.

In the Byzantine period, the book-hand, which in earlier times had more than once approximated to the contemporary cursive, diverged widely from it.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

=== Vellum and paper manuscripts ===
The change from papyrus to [[vellum]] involved no such modification in the forms of letters as followed that from metal to papyrus. The justification for considering the two materials separately is that after the general adoption of vellum, the Egyptian evidence is first supplemented and later superseded by that of [[manuscript]]s from elsewhere, and that during this period the hand most used was one not previously employed for literary purposes.

==== Uncial hand ====
{{See also|Uncial script}}
{{double image|right|Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg|160|Codex Marchalianus Pg 71.JPG|160|Pages from [[Codex Vaticanus]] (left) and [[Codex Marchalianus]] (right)}}

The prevailing type of book-hand during what in [[papyrology]] is called the Byzantine period, that is, roughly from AD 300 to 650, is known as the biblical hand. It went back to at least the end of the 2nd century and had had originally no special connection with [[Christian literature]]. In [[manuscript]]s, whether vellum or paper, of the 4th century found in Egypt are met other forms of script, particularly a sloping, rather inelegant hand derived from the literary hand of the 3rd century, which persisted to at least the 5th century; but the three great early codices of the Bible are all written in uncials of the biblical type. In the [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], placed in the 4th century, the characteristics of the hand are least strongly marked; the letters have the forms characteristic of the type but without the heavy appearance of later manuscripts, and the general impression is one of greater roundness. In the [[Sinaiticus]], which is not much later, the letters are larger and more heavily made; and in the [[Alexandrinus]] (5th century) a later development is seen, with emphatic distinction of thick and thin strokes. By the 6th century, alike in vellum and in papyrus manuscripts, the heaviness had become very marked, though the hand still retained, in its best examples, a handsome appearance; but after this it steadily deteriorated, becoming ever more mechanical and artificial. The thick strokes grew heavier; the cross strokes of '''T''' and '''Θ''' and the base of '''Δ''' were furnished with drooping spurs. The hand, which is often singularly ugly, passed through various modifications, now sloping, now upright, though it is not certain that these variations were really successive rather than concurrent. A different type of uncials, derived from the [[Chancery hand]] and seen in two papyrus examples of the Festal letters despatched annually by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], was occasionally used, the best known example being the [[Codex Marchalianus]] (6th or 7th century). A combination of this hand with the other type is also known.

==== Minuscule hand ====
The uncial hand lingered on, mainly for liturgical manuscripts, where a large and easily legible script was serviceable, as late as the 12th century, but in ordinary use it had long been superseded by a new type of hand, the [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]], which originated in the 8th century, as an adaptation to literary purposes of the second of the types of Byzantine cursive mentioned above. A first attempt at a calligraphic use of this hand, seen in one or two manuscripts of the 8th or early 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P.F. de' Cavalieri &amp; J. Lietzmann, ''Specimina Codicum Graecorum Vaticanorum'' No. 5, Bonn, 1910; G. Vitelli &amp; C. Paoli, ''Collezione fiorentina di facsimili paleografici'', Florence (rist. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; in which it slopes to the right and has a narrow, angular appearance, did not find favour, but by the end of the 9th century a more ornamental type, from which modern Greek script descended, was already established. It has been suggested that it was evolved in the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. T.W. Allen, "Notes on Abbreviations in Greek Manuscripts", ''Joun. Hell. Stud.'', xl, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest examples it is upright and exact but lacks flexibility; accents are small, [[Greek diacritics|breathings]] square in formation, and in general only such [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] are used as involve no change in the shape of letters. The single forms have a general resemblance (with considerable differences in detail) both to the minuscule cursive of late papyri, and to those used in modern Greek type; uncial forms were avoided.

In the course of the 10th century the hand, without losing its beauty and exactness, gained in freedom. Its finest period was from the 9th to the 12th century,{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} after which it rapidly declined. The development was marked by a tendency
# to the intrusion, in growing quantity, of uncial forms which good scribes could fit into the line without disturbing the unity of style but which, in less expert hands, had a disintegrating effect;
# to the disproportionate enlargement of single letters, especially at the beginnings and ends of lines;
# to ligatures, often very fantastic, which quite changed the forms of letters;
# to the enlargement of accents, breathings at the same time acquiring the modern rounded form.
But from the first there were several styles, varying from the formal, regular hands characteristic of service books to the informal style, marked by numerous abbreviations, used in manuscripts intended only for a scholar's private use. The more formal hands were exceedingly conservative, and there are few classes of script more difficult to date than the Greek minuscule of this class. In the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries a sloping hand, less dignified than the upright, formal type, but often very handsome, was especially used for manuscripts of the classics.

Hands of the 11th century are marked in general (though there are exceptions) by a certain grace and delicacy, exact but easy; those of the 12th by a broad, bold sweep and an increasing freedom, which readily admits uncial forms, ligatures and enlarged letters but has not lost the sense of style and decorative effect. In the 13th and still more in the 14th centuries there was a steady decline; the less formal hands lost their beauty and exactness, becoming ever more disorderly and chaotic in their effect, while formal style imitated the precision of an earlier period without attaining its freedom and naturalness, and often appears singularly lifeless. In the 15th century, especially in the West, where Greek scribes were in request to produce manuscripts of the classical authors, there was a revival, and several manuscripts of this period, though markedly inferior to those of the 11th and 12th centuries, are by no means without beauty.

=== Accents, punctuation, and division of words ===
[[File:Paragraphos.png|thumb|Variants of [[paragraphos]]]]
{{See also|Punctuation}}
In the book-hand of early papyri, neither accents nor breathings were employed. Their use was established by the beginning of the Roman period, but was sporadic in papyri, where they were used as an aid to understanding, and therefore more frequently in poetry than prose, and in lyrical oftener than in other verse. In the cursive of papyri they are practically unknown, as are marks of punctuation. Punctuation was effected in early papyri, literary and documentary, by spaces, reinforced in the book-hand by the [[paragraphos]], a horizontal stroke under the beginning of the line. The [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]], a more elaborate form of this, marked the beginning of lyrics or the principal sections of a longer work. Punctuation marks, the [[comma]], the high, low and middle points, were established in the book-hand by the Roman period; in early Ptolemaic papyri, a double point (''':''') is found.

In vellum and paper manuscripts, punctuation marks and accents were regularly used from at least the 8th century, though with some differences from modern practice. At no period down to the invention of printing did Greek scribes consistently separate words. The book-hand of papyri aimed at an unbroken succession of letters, except for distinction of sections; in cursive hands, especially where abbreviations were numerous, some tendency to separate words may be recognised, but in reality it was phrases or groups of letters rather than words which were divided. In the later minuscule word-division is much commoner but never became systematic, accents and breathings serving of themselves to indicate the proper division.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

{{See also|Linguistic history of the Indian subcontinent}}
The view that the art of writing in [[India]] developed gradually, as in other areas of the world, by going through the stages of pictographic, ideographic and transitional phases of the phonetic script, which in turn developed into syllabic and alphabetic scripts was challenged by Falk and others in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|first=Harry|last=Falk|date=1993|publisher=G. Narr|isbn=3823342711|location=Tübingen|oclc=29443654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new paradigm, Indian alphabetic writing, called [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]], was discontinuous with earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and was invented specifically by King [[Ashoka]] for application in his royal [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]]. In the subcontinent, three scripts like Indus, [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] became prevalent. In addition, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic script]]s were also added to the Indian context after their penetration in the early centuries of the [[common era]] (CE). The decipherment and subsequent development of Indus glyphs is also a matter for continuing research and discussion. After a lapse of a few centuries the Kharoṣṭhī script became obsolete; the Greek script in India went through a similar fate and disappeared. But the Brāhmī and Arabic scripts endured for a much longer period. Moreover, there was a change and development in the Brāhmī script which may be traced in time and space through the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], [[Kushan Empire|Kuṣāṇa]], [[Gupta script|Gupta]] and early medieval periods. The present day [[Nāgarī script]] is derived from Brāhmī. The Brāhmī is also the ancestral script of many other Indian scripts, in northern and southern South Asia. Legends and inscriptions in Brāhmī are engraved upon leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Arabic got an important place, particularly in the royalty, during the medieval period and it provides rich material for history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1995|title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts|jstor=604670|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=2|pages=271–279|doi=10.2307/604670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the available inscriptions and manuscripts written in the above scripts—in languages like [[Prakrit|Prākrita]], [[Pali|Pāḷi]], [[Sanskrit|Saṃskṛta]], [[Apabhraṃśa]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]—have been read and exploited for history writing, but numerous inscriptions preserved in different museums still remain undeciphered for lack of competent palaeographic Indologists, as there is a gradual decline in the subcontinent of such disciplines as palaeography, [[epigraphy]] and [[numismatics]]. The discipline of ancient Indian scripts and the languages they are written needs new scholars who, by adopting traditional palaeographic methods and modern technology, may decipher, study and transcribe the various types of epigraphs and legends still extant today.&lt;ref&gt;There are few available texts relating to "Indian palaeography", among which Ahmad Hasan Dani, ''Indian Palaeography'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1997; A. C. Burnell, ''Elements of South-Indian Palaeography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century AD'', repr. 2012; Rajbali Pandey, ''Indian Palaeography'', Motilal Banarasi Das, 1957; Naresh Prasad Rastogi, ''Origin of Brāhmī Script: The Beginning of Alphabet in India'', Chowkhamba Saraswatibhawan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195099842|location=New York|oclc=252595337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the earliest written records, that is, the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], is [[Prakrit]]. Besides Prakrit, the Ashokan edicts are also written in Greek and Aramaic. Moreover, all the edicts of [[Ashoka]] engraved in the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts are in the Prakrit language: thus, originally the language employed in the inscriptions was Prakrit, with Sanskrit adopted at a later stage. Past the period of the [[Maurya Empire]], the use of Prakrit continued in inscriptions for a few more centuries. In north India, Prakrit was replaced by Sanskrit by the end of the 3rd century, while this change took place about a century later in south India. Some of the inscriptions though written in Prakrit, were influenced by Sanskrit and vice versa. The epigraphs of the Kushana kings are found in a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit, while the Mathura inscriptions of the time of Sodasa, belonging to the first quarter of the 1st century, contain verses in classical Sanskrit. From the 4th century onwards, the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] came to power and made Sanskrit flourish by supporting it in language and literature.

In western India and also in some regions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]], Prakrit was used till the 4th century, mostly in the [[Buddhist]] writings though in a few contemporary records of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]], Sanskrit was applied. The inscription of [[Yajna Sri Satakarni]] (2nd century) from [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] is considered to be the earliest so far. The earlier writings (4th century) of Salankayanas of the [[Telugu people|Telugu region]] are in Prakrit, while their later records (belonging to the 5th century) are written in Sanskrit. In the [[Kannada language|Kannada speaking area]], inscriptions belonging to later Satavahanas and Chutus were written in Prakrit. From the 4th century onwards, with the rise of the Guptas, Sanskrit became the predominant language of India and continued to be employed in texts and inscriptions of all parts of India along with the regional languages in the subsequent centuries. The copper-plate charters of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Pandyas]] documents are written in both Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Kannada is used in texts dating from about the 5th century and the [[Halmidi inscription]] is considered to be the earliest [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] written in the [[Kannada language]]. Inscriptions in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] began to appear from the 6th or 7th century. [[Malayalam]] made its beginning in writings from the 15th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Indi"&gt;For this section cf.

=== North India ===
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|[[Rigveda]] manuscript in [[Devanāgarī]] (early 19th century)]]
{{See also|Kharosthi|Devanagari}}
In north India, the [[Brahmi]] script was used over a vast area; however, [[Ashoka]]n inscriptions are also found using [[Kharoshthi]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek script]]s. With the advent of the [[Saka]]-[[Western Kshatrapas|Kshatrapas]] and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] as political powers in north India, the writing system underwent a definite change due to the use of new writing tools and techniques. Further development of the Brahmi script and perceivable changes in its evolutionary trend can be discerned during the Gupta period: in fact, the [[Gupta script]] is considered to be the successor of the Kushana script in north India.

From the 6th to about the 10th century of the [[common era]], the inscriptions in north India were written in a script variously named, e.g., Siddhamatrika and Kutila ("Rañjanā script"). From the 8th century, Siddhamatrika developed into the [[Śāradā script]] in [[Kashmir]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]], into [[Bengali language|Proto-Bengali]] or Gaudi in [[Bengal]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and into [[Devanagari|Nagari]] in other parts of north India. [[Nāgarī script]] was used widely in northern India from the 10th century onwards. The use of [[Nandinagari]], a variant of [[Nagari script]], is mostly confined to the [[Karnataka]] region.

In central India, mostly in [[Madhya Pradesh]], the inscriptions of the [[Vakatakas]], and the kings of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sarabhapura]] and [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]] were written in what are known as "box-headed" and "nail-headed" characters. It may be noted that the early [[Kadambas]] of [[Karnataka]] also employed "nail-headed" characters in some of their inscriptions. During the 3rd–4th century, the script used in the inscriptions of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]] developed a unique style of letter-forms with elongated verticals and artistic flourishes, which did not continue after their rule.&lt;ref name="Indi" /&gt;

=== South India ===
The earliest attested form of writing in [[South India]] is represented by inscriptions found in caves, associated with the [[Chalukya]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the [[Cave character]], and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of [[Vatteluttu]], the exact origins of which are unknown, and [[Nandinagari]], which is a variant of [[Devanagari]] that developed due to later Northern influence. In south India from the 7th century of the common era onwards, a number of inscriptions belonging to the dynasties of Pallava, Chola and Pandya are found. These records are written in three different scripts known as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Vattezhuttu]] and [[Grantha script]]s, the last variety being used to write Sanskrit inscriptions. In the [[Kerala]] region, the Vattezhuttu script developed into a still more cursive script called [[Kolezhuthu]] during the 14th and 15th centuries. At the same time, the modern [[Malayalam]] script developed out of the Grantha script. The early form of the [[Telugu-Kannada script]] is found in the inscriptions of the early [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]] of [[Banavasi]] and the early [[Chalukyas of Badami]] in the west, and [[Salankayana]] and the early Eastern Chalukyas in the east who ruled the Kannada and Telugu speaking areas respectively, during the 4th to 7th centuries.

== Latin ==
{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet}}
Attention should be drawn at the outset to certain fundamental definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads to changes in the size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, '''ADPL''', is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, '''adpl'''. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by the subject matter of the text; the writing used for books (''scriptura libraria'') is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (''epistolaris, diplomatica''). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to stabilise the forms of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.

This being granted, a summary survey of the morphological history of the [[Latin alphabet]] shows the zenith of its modifications at once, for its history is divided into two very unequal periods, the first dominated by majuscule and the second by minuscule writing.&lt;ref name="Bouar"&gt;The contents of the following sections on {{small caps|Latin palaeography}}—especially the parts relating to "Minuscule writing"—are mainly based on the specialist writings consulted and cited throughout the text, from the following sources: primarily the article on ''Latin handwriting'' by French palaeographist A. de Bouard, present {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Palaeography#Latin Writing I |display=Palaeography § Latin Writing |volume=20 |pages=567–573}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/567/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; the requisite [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf ''Fonts for Latin Palaeography – User's manual''], by Juan-Jose Marcos, 2011; Schiapparelli, ''La scrittura latina nell'età romana'', 1921; Giorgio Cencetti, ''Paleografia latina'', Jouvence, 2002; [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Paleografia latina.

=== Overview ===
[[Jean Mabillon]], a French Benedictine monk, scholar and [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], whose work ''De re diplomatica'' was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and [[diplomatics]]. However, the actual term "palaeography" was coined (in Latin) by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], a [[Benedictine monk]], in the title of his ''Palaeographia Graeca'' (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard de Montfaucon et al., ''Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum'', Paris, Ludovicum Guerin (1708).&lt;/ref&gt; With their establishment of palaeography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit [[Daniel Papebroch]], who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'' Fourth Edition (Oxford University, 2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century such scholars as [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]], [[Leopold Delisle]] and [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the 'New French School' of palaeographers, especially [[Jean Mallon]], gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.&lt;ref name=fn_2&gt;R. Marichal, "Paleography" in New Encyclopaedia New York: Gale-Thomson, 2003 Vol. X, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Majuscule writing ===
==== Capital writing ====
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 [[recto]] of the [[Vergilius Romanus]] written in [[rustic capitals]], also contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]]

The [[Latin alphabet]] first appears in the epigraphic type of [[majuscule]] writing, known as capitals. These characters form the main stem from which developed all the branches of Latin writing. On the oldest monuments (the ''inscriptiones bello Hannibalico antiquiores'' of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum = CIL]]''), it is far from showing the orderly regularity of the later period. Side by side with upright and square characters are angular and sloping forms, sometimes very distorted, which seem to indicate the existence of an early cursive writing from which they would have been borrowed. Certain literary texts clearly allude to such a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry B. Van Hoesen, [https://archive.org/details/romancursivewri00hoesgoog ''Roman Cursive Writing''], Princeton University Press, 1915, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the characters of the cursive type were progressively eliminated from formal inscriptions, and capital writing reached its perfection in the [[History of Rome|Augustan Age]].

Epigraphists divide the numerous inscriptions of this period into two quite distinct classes: ''tituli'', or formal inscriptions engraved on stone in elegant and regular capitals, and ''acta'', or legal texts, documents, etc., generally engraved on bronze in cramped and careless capitals. Palaeography inherits both these types. Reproduced by scribes on papyrus or parchment, the elegant characters of the inscriptions become the square capitals of the manuscripts, and the ''actuaria'', as the writing of the ''acta'' is called, becomes the [[rustic capital]].

Of the many books written in square capitals, the ''éditions de luxe'' of ancient times, only a few fragments have survived, the most famous being pages from manuscripts of [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Chatelain]], [http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/classics/index.asp ''Paléographie des classiques latins''], pl. LXI-II, LXXV; ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', viii, 1,098.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest examples of rustic capitals, the use of which is attested by papyri of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl Zangemeister &amp; Wilhelm Wattenbach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wuTEXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Exempla codicum Latinorum''], Koester, 1876, pl. I-II.&lt;/ref&gt; are to be found in manuscripts of Virgil&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 113-117; ''Archivio paleografico italiano'', i, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc.'', pl. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these forms of capital writing offers any difficulty in reading, except that no space is left between the words. Their dates are still uncertain, in spite of attempts to determine them by minute observation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHM2QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Untersuchungen über ausgewählte Kapitel des antiken Buchwesens''], BiblioBazaar, repr. 2010; E.A. Lowe, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3572504 "More Facts about our Oldest Latin Manuscripts"], in the ''Classical Quarterly'', vol. xix, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rustic capitals, more practical than the square forms, soon came into general use. This was the standard form of writing, so far as books are concerned, until the 5th century, when it was replaced by a new type, the uncial, which is discussed below.

==== Early cursive writing ====
While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, was used for the copying of books, the writing of everyday life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the [[graffiti]] on walls at [[Pompeii]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (''CIL'', iv, supplement), a similar series found at [[Verespatak]] in [[Transylvania]] (''CIL'', iii) and a number of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Carl Wessely]], [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001159476 ''Schrifttafeln zur älteren lateinischen Palaeographie''], Leipzig, E. Avenarius; ''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, passim''; Vincenzo Federici, ''Esempi di corsivo antico''; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Franz Steffens, [http://www.paleography.unifr.ch/schrifttafeln.htm ''Lateinische Paläographie'' – digital version''], 2nd ed., pl. 3 {{de icon}}; Wessely, ''Studien'', xiv, pl. viii; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the [[Uncial script|uncial]] and the [[minuscule cursive]]. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the main strokes are prolonged upwards ([[File:Hand 1 sample b 1.png|20px]]= '''b'''; [[File:Hand 10 sample d 2.png|20px]]= '''d''') or downwards ([[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]= '''q'''; [[File:Hand 4 sample s 2.png|15px]] = '''s'''). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== Uncial writing ====
Although the characteristic forms of the uncial type appear to have their origin in the early cursive,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft ''Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography''], ''s.v.''; Van Hoesen, ''The Parentage and Birthdate of the Latin Uncial'', in ''Transactions and Proceedings'' of the [[American Philological Association]], xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a ''libraria'', closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally [[File:Hand 1 sample A mag 2.png|28px]] [[File:Uncial d.png|15px]] [[File:Uncial e.png|15px]] [[File:Hand 2 sample m 1.png|30px]]. It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (''Exempla'', pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;A list is given in Traube, ''Vorlesungen'', i, pp. 171–261, and numerous reproductions in Zangemeister &amp; Wattenbach's ''Exempla'', and in Chatelain, ''Uncialis scriptura''.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Chatelain, ''Unc. script., explanatio tabularum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.

=== Minuscule cursive writing ===
[[File:Chronica archiepiscoporum Magdeburgensium 1r 25-C-4 (16764) Hs Kynžvart 91.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from the [[Magdeburg]]'s ''Chronica archiepiscoporum'']]

==== Early minuscule cursive ====
In the ancient cursive writing, from the 1st century onward, there are symptoms of transformation in the form of certain letters, the shape and proportions of which correspond more closely to the definition of minuscule writing than to that of majuscule. Rare and irregular at first, they gradually become more numerous and more constant and by degrees supplant the majuscule forms, so that in the history of the Roman cursive there is no precise boundary between the majuscule and minuscule periods.

The oldest example of minuscule cursive writing that has been discovered is a letter on papyrus, found in Egypt, dating from the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', iii, pl. i.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a highly important date in the history of Latin writing, for with only one known exception, not yet adequately explained—two fragments of imperial rescripts of the 5th century&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Fragmente zweier Kaiserrescripte'' in ''Jahrbuch des gemeinen deutschen Rechts'', vi, 398; Preisigke in ''Schriften der wissensch. Gesellsch. in Strassburg'', xxx; ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;—the minuscule cursive was consequently the only ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world. The ensuing succession of documents&lt;ref&gt;For example, a certificate of AD 400 in Wessely, ''Studien, cit.'', xiv, pl. xiii; a letter of AD 444 in Wessely, ''Schrifttafeln, cit.'', pl. xii, No. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; show a continuous improvement in this form of writing, characterised by the boldness of the strokes and by the elimination of the last lingering majuscule forms. The [[Ravenna]] deeds of the 5th and 6th centuries&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gaetano Marini, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBF4CR_Ax1kC&amp;redir_esc=y ''I Papiri diplomatici''], Lightning Source UK Ltd, repr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit this hand at its perfection.

At this period, the minuscule cursive made its appearance as a ''[[book hand]]'', first as marginal notes, and later for the complete books themselves. The only difference between the book-hand and that used for documents is that the principal strokes are shorter and the characters thicker. This form of the hand is usually called ''[[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]]''.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== National hands ====
The fall of the Empire and the establishment of the barbarians within its former boundaries did not interrupt the use of the Roman minuscule cursive hand, which was adopted by the newcomers. But for gaps of over a century in the chronological series of documents which have been preserved, it would be possible to follow the evolution of the Roman cursive into the so-called "national hands", forms of minuscule writing which flourished after the barbarian invasions in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]], and which are still known as [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]], [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Insular script|Irish]]. These names came into use at a time when the various national hands were believed to have been invented by the peoples who used them, but their connotation is merely geographical. Nevertheless, in spite of a close resemblance which betrays their common origin, these hands are specifically different, perhaps because the Roman cursive was developed by each nation in accordance with its artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luigi Schiapparelli, ''Note paleografiche'' in ''Archivio storico italiano'', lxxiv, p. 55; also his [https://archive.org/details/lascritturalatin00schi ''La scrittura latina nell' età romana (note paleografiche)''] (with 32 facsimiles), Como, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Lombardic writing''
[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A 10th-century [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'' from [[Reims]]]]
In Italy, after the close of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the writing is known as [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic]], a generic term which comprises several local varieties. These may be classified under four principal types: two for the ''scriptura epistolaris'', the old Italian cursive and the [[pope|papal]] [[chancery hand]], or ''littera romana'', and two for the ''libraria'', the old Italian book-hand and Lombardic in the narrow sense, sometimes known as ''Beneventana'' on account of the fact that it flourished in the principality of [[Benevento]].

The oldest preserved documents written in the old Italian cursive show all the essential characteristics of the Roman cursive of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Giuseppe Bonelli,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiYQAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Codice paleografico lombardo''], Hoepli, 1908; [https://archive.org/details/bullettino0102archuoft ''Archivio paleografico italiano, cit.''], i, iii, vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Italy, this hand began in the 9th century to be influenced by a minuscule book-hand which developed, as will be seen later, in the time of [[Charlemagne]]; under this influence it gradually disappeared, and ceased to exist in the course of the 12th century. In southern Italy, it persisted far on into the [[later Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Michele Russi, [https://archive.org/details/paleografiaedip00russgoog ''Paleografia e diplomatica de' documenti delle Province napolitane''], Naples, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; The papal chancery hand, a variety of Lombardic peculiar to the vicinity of [[Rome]] and principally used in papal documents, is distinguished by the formation of the letters ''a, e, q, t''. It is formal in appearance at first, but is gradually simplified, under the influence of the [[Carolingian minuscule]], which finally prevailed in the [[papal bull|bulls]] of [[Honorius II]] (1124–1130). The [[notaries public]] in Rome continued to use the papal chancery hand until the beginning of the 13th century. The old Italian book-hand is simply a semi-cursive of the type already described as in use in the 6th century. The principal examples are derived from ''[[scriptoria]]'' in northern Italy, where it was displaced by the Carolingian minuscule during the 9th century.  In southern Italy, this hand persisted, developing into a [[calligraphy|calligraphic form]] of writing, and in the 10th century took on a very artistic angular appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elias Avery Lowe, [https://archive.org/details/beneventanscript00loweuoft ''Beneventan Script''], Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1914; [[facsimile]]s in O. Piscicelli Taeggi, ''Paleografia artistica di Monte Cassino'', [[Montecassino]], 1876–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Exultet]]'' rolls provide the finest examples.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In the 9th century, it was introduced in [[Dalmatia]] by the [[Benedictine monks]] and developed there, as in [[Apulia]], on the basis of the [[archetype]], culminating in a rounded ''[[Beneventan script|Beneventana]]'' known as the ''Bari type''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Viktor Novak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RWhzXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Scriptura Beneventana''], [[Zagreb]], 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Merovingian''
[[File:Merov.jpg|160px|left|thumb|8th-century [[Merovingian script]].]]
The offshoot of the Roman cursive which developed in [[Gaul]] under the first dynasty of kings is called [[Merovingian script|Merovingian writing]]. It is represented by thirty-eight royal diplomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lauer |first1=P. |last2=Samaran |first2=C. |oclc=461176420 |title=Les diplômes originaux des Mérovingiens: fac-similés phototypiques avec notices et transcriptions |location=Paris |publisher=E. Leroux |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of private charters&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jules Tardif, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fac-simile-de-chartes-et-diplomes-merovingiens-et-carlovingiens-sur-papyrus-et-sur-parchemin-compris-dans-linventaire-des-monuments-historiques/oclc/12953061 ''Fac-similé de chartes et diplômes mérovingiens et carlovingiens: sur papyrus et sur parchemin compris dans l'inventaire des Monuments historiques''], Paris: J. Claye, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt; and the authenticating documents of relics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurice Prou, ''Manuel de paléographie: Recueil de fac-similés d'écritures du Ve au XVIIe siècle'', Paris: A. Picard et fils, 1904, pl. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less than a century intervenes between the Ravenna cursive and the oldest extant Merovingian document (AD 625), there is a great difference in appearance between the two writings. The facile flow of the former is replaced by a cramped style, in which the natural slope to the right gives way to an upright hand, and the letters, instead of being fully outlined, are compressed to such an extent that they modify the shape of other letters. Copyists of books used a cursive similar to that found in documents, except that the strokes are thicker, the forms more regular, and the heads and tails shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1887_num_48_1_462552 ''Album paléographique de la Société de l'École des chartes''], pl. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merovingian cursive as used in books underwent simplification in some localities, undoubtedly through the influence of the minuscule book-hand of the period. The two principal centres of this reform were [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] and [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Traube, ''Perrona Scottorum'' in ''Sitzungsberichte'' of the [[Munich Academy]], 1900; Liebart, ''Corbie Scriptorum'' in W.M. Lindsay's ''Palaeogr. Lat.'', i.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Visigothic''
[[File:AlfabetoVisigodo.png|thumb|160px|left|Alphabet in [[Visigothic script]].]]
In Spain, after the Visigothic conquest, the Roman cursive gradually developed special characteristics. Some documents attributed to the 7th century display a transitional hand with straggling and rather uncouth forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla scripturae visigothicae'', pl. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive features of Visigothic writing, the most noticeable of which is certainly the q-shaped '''g''', did not appear until later, in the book-hand. The book-hand became set at an early date. In the 8th century it appears as a sort of semi-cursive; the earliest example of certain date is [[manuscript|ms]] lxxxix in the [[Capitulary|Capitular]] [[Library]] in [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clark, ''Collectanea hispanica'', 63, pp. 129–130; Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital, cit.'', lxxxii, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century the calligraphic forms become broader and more rounded until the 11th century, when they become slender and angular.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous reproductions exists in the literature, cf. ''int. al.'', Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla, cit.''; Burnam, ''Paleogr. iberica''; Clark, ''Collectanea, cit.''; Garcia Villada, ''Paleogr. española''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Visigothic minuscule appears in a cursive form in documents about the middle of the 9th century, and in the course of time grows more intricate and consequently less legible.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Munoz, ''Paleogr. visigoda''; Garcia Villada, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It soon came into competition with the Carolingian minuscule, which supplanted it as a result of the presence in Spain of French elements such as [[Cluniac monks]] and warriors engaged in the campaign against the [[Moors]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hessel, ''Ausbreitung der karolingischen Minuskel'' in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', vii, viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish and Anglo-Saxon hands, which were not directly derived from the Roman minuscule cursive, will be discussed in a [[#Irish and Anglo-Saxon Writing|separate sub-section below]].

=== Set minuscule writing ===
One by one, the national minuscule cursive hands were replaced by a set minuscule hand which has already been mentioned and its origins may now be traced from the beginning.

==== Half-uncial writing ====
The early cursive was the medium in which the minuscule forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following the development of the minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, cit.'', iv, pl. vi, No. 668; xi, pl. vi, No. 1,379.&lt;/ref&gt; and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century&lt;ref&gt;''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 127-8; ''Arch. pal. ital., cit.'', v, pl. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until by the end of the 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some [[manuscript]]s. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the "half-uncial"&lt;ref&gt;Cf. many examples in [[Émile Chatelain]], ''Semiuncial Script, passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a synoptic chart of [[Latin script]]s, would appear close to the oldest ''librariae'', and between them and the ''epistolaris'' (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental ''scriptura libraria'' of the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Irish and Anglo-Saxon writing ====
The half-uncial hand was introduced in Ireland along with Latin culture in the 5th century by priests and laymen from [[Gaul]], fleeing before the barbarian invasions. It was adopted there to the exclusion of the cursive, and soon took on a distinct character. There are two well established classes of Irish writing as early as the 7th century: a large round half-uncial hand, in which certain majuscule forms frequently appear, and a pointed hand, which becomes more cursive and more genuinely minuscule. The latter developed out of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wolfgang Keller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IKA3QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Angelsächsische Palaeographie''], Mayer &amp; Müller, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the distinguishing marks of manuscripts of Irish origin is to be found in the initial letters, which are ornamented by interlacing, animal forms, or a frame of red dots. The most certain evidence, however, is provided by the system of abbreviations and by the combined square and cuneiform appearance of the minuscule at the height of its development.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital., cit.'', lxxiv, ii, pp. 1–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of Irish writing were introduced in the north of Great Britain by the monks, and were soon adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], being so exactly copied that it is sometimes difficult to determine the origin of an example. Gradually, however, the Anglo-Saxon writing developed a distinct style, and even local types,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Keller, ''op. cit.''; W.M. Lindsay, [https://archive.org/details/earlywelshscript00lind ''Early Welsh Script''], Oxford: J. Parker &amp; Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; which were superseded after the Norman conquest by the Carolingian minuscule. Through [[St Columba]] and his followers, Irish writing spread to the continent, and manuscripts were written in the Irish hand in the monasteries of [[Bobbio Abbey]] and [[St Gall]] during the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Pre-Caroline ====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;James J. John, "Latin Paleography", in J. Powell, ''Medieval Studies'', 2nd. ed. (Syracuse: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1992), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk [[Augustine of Canterbury]] to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy's dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the invasions by the [[Lombards]], its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', trans. Daibi O Croinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1990), pp. 83–112; 190–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th through the 8th centuries, a number of so-called 'national hands' were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late 6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;John, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carolingian minuscule ====
[[File:Charlemagne miniscule.jpg|thumb|200px|A page in [[Carolingian minuscule]] (''[[Book of Exodus]]'')]]
Beginning in the 8th century, as [[Charlemagne]] began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script ([[Caroline minuscule]]) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th centuries. The origin of this hand is much disputed. This is due to the confusion which prevailed before the Carolingian period in the ''libraria'' in France, Italy and Germany as a result of the competition between the cursive and the set hands. In addition to the calligraphic uncial and half-uncial writings, which were imitative forms, little used and consequently without much vitality, and the minuscule cursive, which was the most natural hand, there were innumerable varieties of mixed writing derived from the influence of these hands on each other. In some, the uncial or half-uncial forms were preserved with little or no modification, but the influence of the cursive is shown by the freedom of the strokes; these are known as rustic, semi-cursive or cursive uncial or half-uncial hands. Conversely, the cursive was sometimes affected, in varying degrees, by the set ''librariae''; the cursive of the ''epistolaris'' became a semi-cursive when adopted as a ''libraria''. Nor is this all. Apart from these reciprocal influences affecting the movement of the hand across the page, there were [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] influences at work, letters being borrowed from one alphabet for another. This led to compromises of all softs and of infinite variety between the uncial and half-uncial and the cursive. It will readily be understood that the origin of the Carolingian minuscule, which must be sought in this tangle of pre-Carolingian hands, involves disagreement. The new writing is admittedly much more closely related to the ''epistolaris'' than the primitive minuscule; this is shown by certain forms, such as the open '''''a''''' ([[File:Hand 1.1 sample a 2.png|20px]]), which recall the cursive, by the joining of certain letters, and by the clubbing of the tall letters '''''b d h l''''', which resulted from a cursive ''[[Ductus (linguistics)|ductus]]''. Most palaeographers agree in assigning the new hand the place shown in the following table:&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

| Semi-cursive
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Controversy turns on the question whether the Carolingian minuscule is the primitive minuscule as modified by the influence of the cursive or a cursive based on the primitive minuscule. Its place of origin is also uncertain: Rome, the [[Palatine]] school, [[Tours]], [[Reims]], [[Metz]], [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and [[Corbie]] have been suggested, but no agreement has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', Harald Steinacker in ''Miscellanea Francesco Ehrle'', Rome, 1924, iv, pp. 126ff; G. Cencetti, "Postilla nuova a un problema paleografico vecchio: l'origine della minuscola carolina", in ''Nova Historia'', 1955, pp. 1–24; B. Bischoff, ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages, cit.'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the appearance of the new hand is a turning point in the history of culture. So far as Latin writing is concerned, it marks the dawn of [[Early modern period|modern times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Thompson |first=Edward Maunde |wstitle=Palaeography |volume=20 |pages=556–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic minuscule ====
In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanistic]] scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian [[Renaissance]] all over Europe.

These humanistic scripts are the base for the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the ''[[Kurrentschrift]]'' was rooted in the [[cursive]] handwriting of the later [[Middle Ages]].  With the name of the [[calligrapher]] Ludwig [[Sütterlin]], this handwriting counterpart to the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s was abolished by [[Hitler]] in 1941. After [[World War II]], it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. [[Secretary hand]] is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.

=== Developments ===

There are undeniable points of contact between [[History of architecture|architecture]] and palaeography, and in both it is possible to distinguish a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The creative effort which began in the post-Carolingian period culminated at the beginning of the 12th century in a [[calligraphy]] and an architecture which, though still somewhat awkward, showed unmistakable signs of power and experience, and at the end of that century and in the first half of the 13th both arts reached their climax and made their boldest flights. The topography of later medieval writing is still being studied; national varieties can, of course, be' identified but the problem of distinguishing features becomes complicated as a result of the development of international relations, and the migration of clerks from one end of Europe to the other. During the later centuries of the [[Middle Ages]] the Gothic minuscule continued to improve within the restricted circle of ''de luxe'' editions and ceremonial documents. In common use, it degenerated into a cursive which became more and more intricate, full of superfluous strokes and complicated by abbreviations. In the first quarter of the 15th century an innovation took place which exercised a decisive influence on the evolution of writing in Europe. The Italian [[humanism|humanists]] were struck by the eminent legibility of the manuscripts, written in the improved Carolingian minuscule of the 10th and 11th centuries, in which they discovered the works of ancient authors, and carefully imitated the old writing. In [[Petrarch]]'s compact book hand, the wider leading and reduced compression and round curves are early manifestations of the reaction against the crabbed Gothic secretarial minuscule we know today as "[[Blackletter#Gothic minuscule|blackletter]]"; Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have written at any length on the handwriting of his time; in his essay on the subject, ''La scrittura''&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', discussed by Armando Petrucci, ''La scrittura di Francesco Petrarca'' (Vatican City) 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its laboured strokes (''artificiosis litterarum tractibus'') and exuberant (''luxurians'') letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (''castigata''), clear (''clara'') and orthographically correct.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', noted in Albert Derolez, "The script reform of Petrarch: an illusion?" in John Haines, Randall Rosenfeld, eds. ''Music and Medieval Manuscripts: paleography and performance'' 2006:5f; Derolez discusses the ''degree'' of Petrarch's often alluded-to reform.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boccaccio]] was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio's immediate circle this post-Petrarchan "semi-gothic" revised hand spread to ''literati'' in [[Florence]], [[Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Mirella Ferrari "La 'littera antiqua' a Milan, 1417–1439" in Johanne Autenrieth, ed. ''Renaissance- und Humanistenhandschriften'', (Munich:  Oldenbourg,) 1988:21–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Daniels, ''Boccaccio and the book: production and reading in Italy 1340–1520'', 2009:28.&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (''illustration'') was [[Poggio Bracciolini]], a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] script in the first decade of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]] recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] of ''lettera antica'' and had transcribed texts to support himself—presumably, as Martin Davies points out—&lt;ref&gt;Davies, in Kraye (ed.) 1996:51.&lt;/ref&gt; before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the [[papal curia]]. [[Berthold Ullman]] identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio's transcription of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum|Epistles to Atticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script'' (Rome) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[Medici]] library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the ''lettera antica''. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Morison]], "Early humanistic script and the first roman type", reprinted in his ''Selected Essays on the History of Letter-Forms in Manuscript and Print'', ed. by David McKitterick, 2 vols. 1981:206-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coluccio Salutati]]. The [[papal chancery]] adopted the new fashion for some purposes, and thus contributed to its diffusion throughout [[Christendom]]. The printers played a still more significant part in establishing this form of writing by using it, from the year 1465, as the basis for their types. The humanistic minuscule soon gave rise to a sloping cursive hand, known as the Italian, which was also taken up by printers in search of novelty and thus became the [[italic type]]. In consequence, the [[Italic script|Italian hand]] became widely used, and in the 16th century began to compete with the Gothic cursive. In the 17th century, writing masters were divided between the two schools, and there was in addition a whole series of compromises. The Gothic characters gradually disappeared, except a few that survived in Germany. The Italian became universally used, brought to perfection in more recent times by English calligraphers.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

[[File:Parchment from goatskin.jpg|right|thumb|Central European (Northern) type of finished parchment made of [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] stretched on a wooden frame]]
[[File:קלף, נוצה ודיו.jpg|thumb|Parchment with a quill and ink]]
'''Parchment''' is a writing material made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats. It has been used as a writing medium for over two millennia. [[Vellum]] is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves.

It may be called '''animal membrane''' by libraries and museums that wish to avoid distinguishing between "parchment" and the more restricted term vellum (see below).

== Parchment and vellum ==
Today the term "parchment" is often used in non-technical contexts to refer to any animal skin, particularly [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[cow]], that has been scraped or dried under tension. The term originally referred only to the skin of sheep and, occasionally, goats. The equivalent material made from calfskin, which was of finer quality, was known as [[vellum]] (from the [[Old French]] ''velin'' or ''vellin'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''vitulus'', meaning a calf);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Roy|title=Conservation of Leather and Related Materials |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-7506-4881-3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the finest of all was "uterine vellum", taken from a calf [[foetus]] or [[stillbirth|stillborn]] calf.

Some authorities have sought to observe these distinctions strictly: for example, [[lexicographer]] [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1755, and master [[calligrapher]] [[Edward Johnston]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Johnston |authorlink=Edward Johnston |year=1906 |title=Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering |place=London |publisher=John Hogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when old books and documents are encountered it may be difficult, without scientific analysis, to determine the precise animal origin of a skin either in terms of its species, or in terms of the animal's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, therefore, there has long been considerable blurring of the boundaries between the different terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] wrote in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (written c. 1599–1602) the following exchange occurs:
{{quote|''Hamlet.'' Is not parchment made of sheepskins?&lt;br /&gt;
''Horatio.'' Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Shakecite|Ham|M|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee Ustick, writing in 1936, commented that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is for these reasons that many modern [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[librarian]]s and [[archivist]]s prefer to use either the broader term "parchment", or the neutral term "animal membrane".&lt;ref&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Permennter-1568.png|thumb|upright|German parchmenter, 1568]]

The word parchment evolved (via the Latin ''pergamenum'' and the French ''parchemin'') from the name of the city of [[Pergamon]] which was a thriving center of parchment production during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |title=parchment (writing material) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705155624/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose which said that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of [[papyrus]] which had become monopolized by the rival city of [[Alexandria]]. This account, originating in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Book XII, 69–70), is dubious because parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Peter |title=Alexander to Actium: the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age |place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |isbn=0520056116 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions writing on skins as common in his time, the 5th century BC; and in his ''Histories'' (v.58) he states that the Ionians of Asia Minor had been accustomed to give the name of ''skins'' (''diphtherai'') to books; this word was adapted by Hellenized Jews to describe scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |title=Parchment |author=Meir Bar-Ilan |website=Bar-Ilan University – Faculty Members Homepages |access-date=2005-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422080330/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |archive-date=2005-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Library of Pergamum|a great library]] was set up in Pergamon that rivaled the famous [[Library of Alexandria]]. As prices rose for papyrus and the reed used for making it was over-harvested towards local extinction in the two [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] of the [[Nile delta]] that produced it, Pergamon adapted by increasing use of parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|title=The History Of Vellum And Parchment {{!}} The New Antiquarian {{!}} The Blog of The Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.abaa.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830081534/https://www.abaa.org/Blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|archive-date=30 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. [[David Diringer]] noted that "the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2550–2450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the [[Cairo Museum]]; a roll of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] (c. 1990–1777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the [[British Museum]] (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of [[Ramses II]] (early thirteenth century BC)."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Babylonians]] impressed their [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. [[Rabbinic literature]] traditionally maintains that the institution of employing parchment made of animal hides for the writing of ritual objects such as the [[Torah]], [[mezuzah]], and [[tefillin]] is [[Revelation at Sinai|Sinaitic]] in origin, with special designations for different types of parchment such as [[gevil]] and [[klaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic texts are also found on parchment.

In the later [[Middle Ages]], especially the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by [[paper]] for most uses except luxury manuscripts, some of which were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was made of textile rags and of very high quality. With the advent of [[printing]] in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of animal skins for parchment.

[[File:NLW Penrice and Margam Deeds 204 front (8634702372).jpg|thumb|left|Latin [[Grant (money)|grant]] written on fine parchment or [[vellum]] with [[seal (device)|seal]] dated 1329]]

There was a short period during the introduction of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, [[Johannes Trithemius]] preferred the older methods, because "handwriting placed on parchment will be able to endure a thousand years. But how long will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years that is a long time."&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in David McKitterick, ''Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.

The heyday of parchment use was during the medieval period, but there has been a growing revival of its use among artists since the late 20th century. Although parchment never stopped being used (primarily for governmental documents and diplomas) it had ceased to be a primary choice for artist's supports by the end of 15th century [[Renaissance]]. This was partly due to its expense and partly due to its unusual working properties. Parchment consists mostly of [[collagen]]. When the water in paint media touches parchment's surface, the collagen melts slightly, forming a raised bed for the paint, a quality highly prized by some artists.
[[File:Sachsenspiegel.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A 1385 copy of the [[Sachsenspiegel]], a German legal code, written on parchment with straps and clasps on the binding]]
Parchment is also extremely affected by its environment and changes in humidity, which can cause buckling. Books with parchment pages were bound with strong wooden boards and clamped tightly shut by metal (often brass) clasps or leather straps;&lt;ref name="pul" /&gt; this acted to keep the pages pressed flat despite humidity changes. Such metal fittings continued to be found on books as decorative features even after the use of paper made them unnecessary.&lt;ref name="pul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |title=Clasps, Furniture, and Other Closures |author= |year=2004 |work=Hand Bookindings |publisher=Princeton University Library |accessdate=4 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208042037/http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |archive-date=2011-12-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary artists prize the changeability of parchment, noting that the material seems alive and like an active participant in making artwork. To support the needs of the revival of use by artists, a revival in the art of preparing individual skins is also underway. Hand-prepared skins are usually preferred by artists because they are more uniform in surface and have fewer oily spots which can cause long-term cracking of paint than mass-produced parchment, which is usually made for lamp shades, furniture, or other interior design purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of current artists using parchment see:

The [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques that are used on papyrus can be applied to parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of the parchment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=F.J.|last2=Gomez-Martinez|first2=I.|last3=Garcia-Leon|first3=M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of medieval manuscripts from the University of Seville|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|format=PDF|website=[[Digital.csic.es]]|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102317/http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do due to the fact that they are generally present on the text only in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in the parchment contaminating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolte|first=D.|year=2011|title=UA experts determine age of book 'nobody can read'|url=http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|website=www.uanews.org|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164910/http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|archive-date=2015-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Parchment is prepared from pelt&amp;nbsp;– i.e. wet, unhaired, and limed skin&amp;nbsp;– by drying at ordinary temperatures under tension, most commonly on a wooden frame known as a stretching frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=Ronald |title=Ancient Skins Parchments and Leathers |year=1972 |publisher=Seminar Press |place=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flaying, soaking, and dehairing ===
After being flayed, the skin is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a dehairing liquor.&lt;ref name='reed75'&gt;Reed, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the [[Middle Ages]] an unhairing bath included [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened by the use of sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the [[alkaline]] solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred two or three times a day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.&lt;ref name='reed75' /&gt;

=== Stretching ===
After soaking in water to make the skins workable, the skins were placed on a stretching frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the air so they could be scraped with a sharp, [[blade#Patterns of knife blades|semi-lunar knife]] to remove the last of the hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of [[collagen]], would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.

== Treatments ==
{{See also|Purple parchment}}
To make the parchment more aesthetically pleasing or more suitable for the [[scribe]]s, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing [[pumice]] powder into the flesh side of parchment while it was still wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.&lt;ref&gt;See for example recipes in the [[Secretum Philosophorum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meliora di Curci in her paper "The History and Technology of Parchment Making" notes that parchment was not always white. "[[Cennino Cennini|Cennini]], a 15th century craftsman provides recipes to tint parchment a variety of colours including purple, indigo, green, red and peach." The Early medieval [[Codex Argenteus]] and [[Codex Vercellensis]], the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] and the [[Codex Brixianus]] give a range of luxuriously produced manuscripts all on [[purple vellum]], in imitation of Byzantine examples, like the [[Rossano Gospels]], [[Sinope Gospels]] and the [[Vienna Genesis]], which at least at one time are believed to have been reserved for Imperial commissions.

Many techniques for [[parchment repair]] exist, to restore creased, torn, or incomplete parchments.

=== Reuse ===
{{Main|Palimpsest}}
During the seventh through the ninth centuries, many earlier parchment manuscripts were scrubbed and scoured to be ready for rewriting, and often the earlier writing can still be read. These recycled parchments are called [[palimpsest]]s. Later, more thorough techniques of scouring the surface irretrievably lost the earlier text.

== Jewish parchment ==

{{See also|Gevil|Klaf|Duchsustus}}
The way in which parchment was processed (from hide to parchment) has undergone a tremendous evolution based on time and location. Parchment and vellum are not the sole methods of preparing animal skins for writing. In the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14B) Moses writes the first Torah Scroll on the unsplit cow-hide called ''[[gevil]]''.

Parchment is still the only medium used by traditional [[religious]] [[Jews]] for [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] or [[tefilin]] and [[mezuzah]]s, and is produced by large companies in [[Israel]]. For those uses, only hides of [[kosher]] animals are permitted. Since there are many requirements for it being fit for the religious use, the liming is usually processed under supervision of a qualified [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information Leaflet by Vaad Mishmereth Staam |website=CC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410134250/http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional uses of the term ==
In some universities, the word parchment is still used to refer to the certificate (scroll) presented at graduation ceremonies, even though the modern document is printed on paper or thin card; although doctoral graduates may be given the option of having their scroll written by a calligrapher on vellum. The [[University of Notre Dame]] still uses animal parchment for its [[diploma]]s. Similarly, [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]] use goat skin parchment for their degrees.

=== Plant-based parchment ===
{{See also|Parchment paper (baking)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
'''Vegetable (paper) parchment''' is made by passing a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into [[sulfuric acid]]. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.

Other processes can be used to obtain grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using [[fluorine]]-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A [[silicone]]-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. [[Chromium]] salts can also be used to impart moderate anti-stick properties.

== Parchment craft ==
{{Main|Parchment craft}}
Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts.

Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the nineteenth century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.

Parchment craft today involves various techniques, including tracing a pattern with white or colored ink, embossing to create a raised effect, stippling, perforating, coloring and cutting. Parchment craft appears in hand made cards, as scrapbook embellishments, as bookmarks, lampshades, decorative small boxes, wall hangings and more.

== DNA testing ==
An article published in 2009 by Timothy L. Stinson considered the possibilities of tracing the origin of medieval parchment manuscripts and codices through [[DNA]] analysis. The methodology would employ [[polymerase chain reaction]] to replicate a small DNA sample to a size sufficiently large for testing. A 2006 study had revealed the genetic signature of several Greek manuscripts to have "goat-related sequences". It might be possible to use these techniques to determine whether related library materials were made from genetically related animals (perhaps from the same herd).&lt;ref&gt;Stinson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16000">'''Post-postmodernism''' is a wide-ranging set of developments in [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[culture]] which are emerging from and reacting to [[postmodernism]]. Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].

==Periodization==
Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''profession''' is a occupation founded upon specialized [[educational]] [[training]], the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Statesman]], 21 April 1917, article by [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] quoted with approval at paragraph 123 of a report by the UK Competition Commission, dated 8 November 1977, entitled [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402141250/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1976_1979/108architects.htm ''Architects Services''] (in Chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.professions.org.au/about-us/what-is-a-professional|title=What is a Profession|publisher = Australian Council of Professions|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a truncation of the term "liberal profession", which is, in turn, an Anglicization of the French term "profession libérale". Originally borrowed by English users in the 19th century, it has been re-borrowed by international users from the late 20th, though the (upper-middle) class overtones of the term do not seem to survive retranslation: "liberal professions" are, according to the [[European Union]]'s Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) "those practiced on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public".

It has been said that a profession is not a trade&lt;ref&gt;John J Parker, "A Profession Not a Skilled Trade" (1955-1956) 8 South Carolina Law Quarterly 179 [https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sclr8&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline]; Sommerlad, Harris-Short, Vaughan and Young (eds), The Futures of Legal Education and the Legal Profession, Bloomsbury, 2015, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yUq9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 147]; Richard Colman, [https://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/medicine-profession-not-trade "Medicine is a profession not a trade"], British Medical Journal, 7 October 2001; A M Linz, "A profession, not a trade" (December 1990) New York State Dental Journal 56(10):16 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2080056/ PubMed]; E. G. Eberle, "The practice of medicine held to be a profession and not a trade" (August 1939) 28 Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association 482 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jps.3080280802 Wiley]; Wendler, Tremml and Buecker (eds), Key Aspects of German Business Law: A Practical Manual, 2nd Ed, Springer, 2002, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nj6bBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 255]; William F Ryan, "Methods of Achieving Professional Recognition" (1946) The American Engineer, vols 16-17, p 8 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MdEmAAAAMAAJ] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v7gpAQAAMAAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; and not an industry.&lt;ref&gt;(1961) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xHchAQAAIAAJ 2] The Industrial and Labour Law Digest, 1926-1959, Annotated 668; Sharma and Goyal, Hospital Administration And Human Resource Management, 5th Ed, PHI Learning, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HFzTry0ll9kC&amp;pg=PA445#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 445].&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jesus and the doctors of the Faith dsc01783.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;''Jesus and the doctors of the Faith'', &lt;br /&gt; by the entourage of [[Giuseppe Ribera]]&lt;/div&gt;]]

Medieval and early modern tradition recognized only three professions: [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], [[medicine]], and [[law]]

&lt;ref name="perks-p2"/&gt; – the so-called "learned professions".&lt;ref&gt;See for example:

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Major milestones which may mark an occupation being identified as a profession include:&lt;ref name="perks-p2"&gt;Perks, R.W.(1993): ''Accounting and Society''. Chapman &amp; Hall (London); {{ISBN|0-412-47330-5}}. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

# an occupation becomes a full-time occupation
# the establishment of a [[educational institution|training school]]
# the establishment of a [[university]] school
# the establishment of a local [[Voluntary association|association]]
# the establishment of a national association of [[professional ethics]]
# the establishment of state [[Licensure|licensing]] laws

Applying these milestones to the historical sequence of development in the United States shows [[surveying]] achieving professional status first (note that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln all worked as land surveyors before entering politics{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}), followed by medicine,  [[actuarial science]], law, [[dentistry]], [[civil engineering]], [[logistics]], [[architecture]] and [[accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;Perks, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of technology and occupational specialization in the 19th century, other bodies began to claim professional status: [[mechanical engineering]], [[pharmacy]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[psychology]], [[nursing]], [[teaching]], [[librarianship]], [[optometry]] and [[social work]], each of which could claim, using these milestones, to have become professions by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, J.W. &amp; Buckley, M.H. (1974): ''The Accounting Profession''. Melville, Los Angeles. Quoted by Perks, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as some professions rise in status and power through various stages, others may decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Disciplines formalized more recently, such as architecture, now have equally long periods of study associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although professions may enjoy relatively high status and public prestige, not all professionals earn high salaries, and even within specific professions there exist significant inequalities of compensation; in law, for example, a corporate/insurance [[defense lawyer]] working on a billable-hour basis may earn several times what a [[District attorney|prosecutor]] or [[public defender]] earns.

==Formation==
A profession arises when any trade or occupation transforms itself through ''"the development of formal qualifications based upon education, apprenticeship, and examinations, the emergence of regulatory bodies with powers to admit and discipline members, and some degree of [[monopoly]] rights."''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley, ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper-Collins, 1999, p.689.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
{{Main article|Professional body}}
Originally, any regulation of the professions was [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] through bodies such as the [[College of Physicians]] or the [[Inns of Court]]. With the growing role of government, statutory bodies have increasingly taken on this role, their members being appointed either by the profession or (increasingly) by government. Proposals for the introduction or enhancement of statutory regulation may be welcomed by a profession as protecting clients and enhancing its quality and reputation, or as restricting access to the profession and hence enabling higher fees to be charged. It may be resisted as limiting the members' freedom to innovate or to practice as in their professional judgement they consider best.

An example was in 12, when the British government proposed wide statutory regulation of psychologists. The inspiration for the change was a number of problems in the [[psychotherapy]] field, but there are various kinds of psychologist including many who have no clinical role and where the case for regulation was not so clear. [[Industrial and organizational psychology|Work psychology]] brought especial disagreement, with the [[British Psychological Society]] favoring statutory regulation of "occupational psychologists" and the [[Association of Business Psychologists]] resisting the statutory regulation of "business psychologists" – descriptions of professional activity which it may not be easy to distinguish.

Besides regulating access to a profession, professional bodies may set [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s of competence and enforce adherence to an [[ethical code]].  There may be several such bodies for one profession in a single country, an example being the [[British qualified accountants|accountancy bodies]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], [[Chartered Accountants Ireland|CAI]], [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]], [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy|CIPFA]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|ICAEW]] and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|ICAS]]), all of which have been given a [[Royal Charter]], although their members are not necessarily considered to hold equivalent qualifications, and which operate alongside further bodies ([[Association of Authorised Public Accountants|AAPA]], [[Institute of Financial Accountants|IFA]], [[Certified Public Accountants Association|CPAA]]). Another example of a regulatory body that governs a profession is the Hong Kong Professional Teachers Union, which governs the conduct, rights, obligations and duties of salaried teachers working in educational institutions in Hong Kong.

The [[engineering]] profession is highly regulated in some countries (Canada and USA) with a strict licensing system for [[Professional Engineer]] that controls the practice but not in others (UK) where titles and qualifications are regulated [[Chartered Engineer]] but practice is not regulated. 

Typically, individuals are required by law to be qualified by a local professional body before they are permitted to practice in that profession. However, in some countries, individuals may not be required by law to be qualified by such a professional body in order to practice, as is the case for accountancy in the [[United Kingdom]] (except for auditing and insolvency work which legally require qualification by a professional body). In such cases, qualification by the professional bodies is effectively still considered a prerequisite to practice as most employers and clients stipulate that the individual hold such qualifications before hiring their services. For example, in order to become a fully qualified teaching professional in Hong Kong working in a state or government-funded school, one needs to have successfully completed a [[Postgraduate Diploma in Education]] ("PGDE") or a bachelor's degree in [[Education]] ("BEd") at an approved tertiary educational institution or university. This requirement is set out by the Educational Department Bureau of Hong Kong, which is the governmental department that governs the Hong Kong education sector.

==Autonomy==
Professions tend to be autonomous, which means they have a high degree of control of their own affairs: ''"professionals are autonomous insofar as they can make independent judgments about their work"''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, Michael D. ''Professional Ethics.'' Belmont, California: Wadsworth, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This usually means ''"the freedom to exercise their professional judgement."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/20archives/a21/ "The World Medical Association Declaration of Madrid on Professional Autonomy and Self-Regulation", 1987.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205094738/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/20archives/a21/ |date=5 December 2010 }} Revised in France in 2005, rescinded and archived in India in 2009, and rewritten and adopted in India in 2009 as [http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/r4/index.html "WMA Declaration of Madrid on Professionally-led Regulation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827010024/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/r4/index.html |date=27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it also has other meanings. ''"Professional autonomy is often described as a claim of professionals that has to serve primarily their own interests...this professional autonomy can only be maintained if members of the profession subject their activities and decisions to a critical evaluation by other members of the profession "''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1009925423036 |pmid=11142442 |year=2000 |last1=Hoogland |first1=Jan |title=Professional autonomy and the normative structure of medical practice |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=457–75 |last2=Jochemsen |first2=Henk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of autonomy can therefore be seen to embrace not only judgement, but also self-interest and a continuous process of critical evaluation of ethics and procedures from within the profession itself.

One major implication of professional autonomy is the traditional ban on corporate practice of the professions, especially accounting, architecture, medicine, and law. This means that in many jurisdictions, these professionals cannot do business through regular for-profit corporations and raise capital rapidly through [[initial public offering|initial public offerings or flotation]]s.  Instead, if they wish to practice collectively they must form special business entities such as partnerships or [[professional corporation]]s, which feature (1) reduced protection against liability for professional negligence and (2) severe limitations or outright prohibitions on ownership by non-professionals.  The obvious implication of this is that all equity owners of the professional business entity must be professionals themselves.  This avoids the possibility of a non-professional owner of the firm telling a professional how to do his or her job and thereby protects professional autonomy.  The idea is that the ''only'' non-professional person who should be telling the professional what to do is the ''client''; in other words, professional autonomy preserves the integrity of the two-party professional-client relationship.  But because professional business entities are effectively locked out of the stock market, they tend to grow relatively slowly compared to public corporations.

==Status and prestige==
{{Main article|Occupational prestige}}
Professions enjoy a high [[social status]], regard and esteem conferred upon them by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ron |last1=Tinsley |first2=James C. |last2=Hardy |year=2003 |title=Faculty pressures and professional self-esteem: Life in Texas teacher education |journal=Essays in Education |volume=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpath.org/index.asp?PageID=28 |title=Royal College of Pathologists, '&amp;#39;The role of the College and benefits of membership,'&amp;#39; 16 Dec 2005 |publisher=Rcpath.org |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510001856/http://www.rcpath.org/index.asp?PageID=28 |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high esteem arises primarily from the higher social function of their work, which is regarded as vital to society as a whole and thus of having a special and valuable nature. All professions involve technical, specialized and highly skilled work often referred to as ''"professional [[expertise]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/095148404323043136 |pmid=15198857 |title=The role of professional expertise in the purchasing of health services |journal=Health Services Management Research |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=110–20 |year=2016 |last1=Lian |first1=P. C. S |last2=Laing |first2=A. W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training for this work involves obtaining degrees and professional qualifications (see [[Licensure]]) without which entry to the profession is barred ([[occupational closure]]). Updating skills through [[continuing education]] is required through training.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==Power==
All professions have power.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Johnson, ''Professions and Power,'' London: Heinemann, 1972.{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This power is used to control its own members, and also its area of expertise and interests. A profession tends to dominate, police and protect its area of expertise and the conduct of its members, and exercises a dominating influence over its entire field which means that professions can act monopolist,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larkin, ''Occupational Monopoly and Modern Medicine'', London: Tavistock, 1983.{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebuffing competition from ancillary trades and occupations, as well as subordinating and controlling lesser but related trades.&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. S. Freund and Meredith B. McGuire. ''Health, Illness, and the Social Body: A Critical Sociology'', New Jersey, USA: Prentice Hall, 1995, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;  A profession is characterized by the power and high prestige it has in society as a whole. It is the power, prestige and value that society confers upon a profession that more clearly defines it. The power of professions has led to them being referred to as [[conspiracies against the laity]].
On the other hand, professionals acquire some of their power and authority in organizations from their expertise and [[knowledge]]. As such they can bend rules, reduce bureaucratic inertia and increase problem solving and adaptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Guy Benveniste]]|title=Professionalizing the Organization|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
There is considerable agreement about defining the characteristic features of a profession. They have a "professional association, cognitive base, institutionalized training, licensing, [[work autonomy]], colleague control... (and) code of ethics",&lt;ref&gt;Magali Sarfatti Larson, ''The Rise of Professionalism: a Sociological Analysis,'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; to which Larson then also adds, "high standards of professional and intellectual excellence," (Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;221) that "professions are occupations with special power and prestige", (Larson, p.x) and that they comprise "an exclusive [[elite]] group," (Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;20) in all societies. Members of a profession have also been defined as "workers whose qualities of detachment, autonomy, and group allegiance are more extensive than those found among other groups...their attributes include a high degree of systematic knowledge; strong community orientation and [[loyalty]]; self-regulation; and a system of rewards defined and administered by the community of workers."&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Brown, ''The Definition of a Profession: the Authority of Metaphor in the History of Intelligence Testing, 1890-1930'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt;

A profession has been further defined as: "a special type of occupation...(possessing) corporate solidarity...prolonged specialized training in a body of abstract knowledge, and a collectivity or service orientation...a vocational sub-culture which comprises implicit codes of behavior, generates an [[esprit de corps]] among members of the same profession, and ensures them certain occupational advantages...(also) bureaucratic structures and monopolistic privileges to perform certain types of work...professional literature, legislation, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=C. |last2=Hodge |first2=M. N. |chapter=Occupations and Professions |pages=19–50 |chapterurl={{Google books|7ydCAAAAIAAJ|page=19|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=J. A. |editor1-last=Jackson |year=1970 |title=Professions and Professionalization |series=Sociological Studies |isbn=978-0-521-07982-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical characteristic of a profession is the need to cultivate and exercise professional ''discretion'' - that is, the ability to make case by case ''judgements'' that cannot be determined by an absolute rule or instruction.&lt;ref name=pmid12004638&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/chp.1340220102 |pmid=12004638 |title=Developing professional judgment |journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2002 |last1=Coles |first1=Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashden.org/files/case_studies/SRSP%20Pakistan.pdf|title=Winner case study summary: Sarhad Rural Support Programme, Pakistan.|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access, supported by the IKEA Foundation Award|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/SRSP15|title=The power of water brings new life to mountain villages|last=|first=|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webwidemedia.net/rspn/index.php/about-us/awards-recognition|title=Awards &amp; Recognitions {{!}} RSPN|last=|first=|date=|website=Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/804936/what-the-smart-villages-of-pakistan-can-teach-us-about-energy|title=What the ‘smart villages’ of Pakistan can teach us about energy|last=Cheema|first=Abdur Rehman|date=12 March 2016|newspaper=Scroll.in|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">In archaeological terms, [[graffiti]] (plural of [[graffito (archaeology)|graffito]]) is a mark, image or writing scratched or engraved into a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert C.|title=Invisible Romans|date=2011|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, Mass|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous examples found on sites of the [[Roman Empire]], including taverns and houses, as well as on pottery of the time.  In many cases the graffiti tend toward the rude, with a line etched into the basilica in [[Pompeii]] reading "Lucilla made money from her body," phallic images, as well as erotic pictures.&lt;ref name=Mount&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mount|first1=Harry|title=What Can We Learn from Roman Graffiti? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10336768/What-can-we-learn-from-Roman-graffiti.html |accessdate=3 November 2015|work=The Telegraph'|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the graffiti left behind from the Roman Period can give a better understanding of the daily life and attitudes of the Roman people with conclusions drawn about how everyday Romans talked, where they spent their time, and their interactions within those spaces.

==Graffiti Samples==
Inscriptions cover a range of topics from poems, advertisements, political statements, to greetings. There are two forms of graffiti: painted inscriptions (usually public notices) and inscribed inscriptions (spontaneous messages).

===Pompeii===
Over 11,000 graffiti samples have been uncovered in the excavations of [[Pompeii]]. Archaeologists have been studying and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has not survived the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlson, Kristin. "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/reading-the-writing-on-pompeiis-walls-1969367/ Reading the Writing on Pompeii's Walls]." Smithsonian, 26 July 2010. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====House of Maius Castricius====
[[File:Pompeii Stairwell Poetry.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of poetry from stairwell of House of Maius Castricius, Pompeii]]
This domestic residence shows that ancient graffiti was not limited to the public sphere, as graffiti is in modern day. This site, discovered in the 1960s, has benefited from preservation efforts, leaving the graffiti samples in their original context and remain legible. There is a unique feature of eleven graffiti containing multiple lines of poetry. For the most part, the poems are arranged vertically and respect the space of the others. This mix of original work and common phases are not a miscellaneous group because of the number and composition; instead, it appears that a conversation has formed.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Dialogues of Ancient Graffiti in the House of Maius Castricius in Pompeii." American Journal of Archaeology 114.1 (2010): 59-101. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

One passage on the staircase reads:
     vasia quae rapui, quaeris formosa puella
     accipe quae rapui non ego solus; ama.
     quisquis amat valeat 

Which translates to:
     Beautiful girl, you seek the kisses that I stole.
     Receive what I was not alone in taking; love.
     Whoever loves, may she fare well.

====Outside the shop of Fabius Ululitremulus====
[[File:Arma virumque cano.jpg|thumbnail|right|Three inscriptions referring to the opening line of the Aeneid]]

An example here demonstrates a familiarity with [[Virgil]] and [[hexameter]] verse. On the doorpost of the shop near pictures of [[Aeneas]] and [[Romulus]] is written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sander M. Goldberg |authorlink= |title=Constructing Literature in the Roman Republic |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University |location= |pages=20 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSWUPFkvYaUC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Fullones+ululamque+cano,+non+arma+virumque.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq7CIlC3L9&amp;sig=Vl2_Y6pd6MhI3XWHm922FDJicWs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip4-7Ro9XKAhUH_R4KHc0ZBiAQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Fullones%20ululamque%20cano%2C%20non%20arma%20virumque.&amp;f=false |isbn=9780521854610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

     Fullones ululamque cano, non arma virumque.

Translating to:

     I sing of cloth-launderers and an owl, not [[Aeneid#Theme|arms and a man]].

The owl is a signifier of [[Minerva]], the goddess who has been said to be protector over the profession of [[fullo]]nes.&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;

[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] notes that there are more than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil in Pompeii alone, but also notes that the majority of the references are to the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the [[Aeneid]], suggesting that these lines may have been widely known in the fashion "[[To be, or not to be]]" is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mary Beard |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |title=SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome |year=2015 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location= |pages=369–370 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKL4CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT369&amp;lpg=PT369&amp;dq=fullones+ululamque+cano,+non+arma+virumque&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0VZObZdvYs&amp;sig=dUTHHTbhZkDp41dqOynSco2HwIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPr_TLo9fKAhUK0h4KHTGKCa0Q6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=fullones%20ululamque%20cano%2C%20non%20arma%20virumque&amp;f=false |isbn=9781631491252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogues===
[[File:8259(Successus textor).jpg|thumbnail|right|Inscription diaologue]]

Graffiti is often meant to be seen and expects to be read. A dialogue is formed between the reader and the inscription and can be simple as they speak directly to the readers in forms such as "if anyone sits here, let him read this before everything else…" as well as "He who writes this is in love… and I who reads this am a prick."

There are also dialogues where one passage answers another. These responses take the forms of greetings, insults, prayers, etc.
     Successus textor amat coponiaes ancilla(m)
     nomine Hiredem quae quidem illum
     non curat sed ille rogat illa com(m)iseretur
     scribit rivalis vale

Translates to :
     Successus the weaver is in love with the slave of the
     Innkeeper, whose name is Iris. She doesn't care about
     him at all, but he asks that she take pity on him.
     A rival wrote this

A response to this translates to:&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;
     You're so jealous you're bursting. Don't tear down
     someone more handsome―
     a guy who could beat you up and who is good-looking.

===Games and riddles===
Word squares ([[magic square]]) and riddles are also common forms of the culture of graffiti. These show a level of mental agility and flexibility of language.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Magic Squares, Alphabet Jumbles, Riddles and More: The Culture of Word-Games among the Graffiti of Pompeii." ''The Muse at Play''. Vol. 305. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2012. 65-80. Web. 4 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Examples of handwritten alphabets are common graffiti in Pompeii and could be evidence of children practicing their alphabet. This lends to the argument that children were responsible for much of the graffiti. However, the height of the inscriptions and location may contradict this.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"/&gt;

==Commentary==
Writing around 100 AD, [[Plutarch]] wrote of graffiti: "There is nothing written in them which is either useful or pleasing – only so-and-so 'remembers' so-and-so, and 'wishes him the best', and is 'the best of his friends', and many things full of such ridiculousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Emily Gowers]] |title=Ancient vandalism? |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1493961.ece |quote= |pages= |work=Times Literary Supplement |location= |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

21st-century scholars have found more to study and enjoy in the visual art and [[intertextuality]] of Roman graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kristina Milnor |authorlink= |title=Graffiti and the Literary Landscape in Roman Pompeii |year=2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |pages= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndbQAgAAQBAJ |isbn=9780199684618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than simply text and thought, Roman graffiti give insight into the use of space and how people interacted within it. Studying the motivation behind the marks reveals a trend for the graffiti to be located where people spend time and pass most frequently as they move through a space. Common places for graffiti are staircases, central peristyle, and vestibule. The use of graffiti by Romans has been said to be very different from the defacing trends of modern day, with the text blending into the walls and rooms by respecting the frescoes and decoration with the use of small letters. In this way, the environment influences the graffiti by subject and organization, and the graffiti in turn changes and influences the environment.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;

==Studying graffiti==
Typical techniques when studying graffiti include drawing each inscription and taking photographs if special attention is required. When only a shadow of the engravings are visible to the naked eye, other methods of observance are needed to decipher the engravings.

===3D laser profilometry===

Using 3D laser profilometry to analyze the roughness of a surface, archaeologists have been able to determine the tools used in engraving. This technique merged with photographs taken with oblique light, different lighting conditions, and results from [[electrostatic detection device]]s have increased the readability of illegible inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Isabelle, et al. "Analysis of Roman Pottery Graffiti by High Resolution Capture and 3D Laser Profilometry." Journal of Archaeological Science 39.11 (2012): 3349.Web&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

'''Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity''', or '''SMOS''', is a [[satellite]] which forms part of [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Living Planet Programme]]. It is intended to provide new insights into Earth's [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. In addition, it is intended to provide improved weather forecasting and monitoring of snow and ice accumulation.&lt;ref name = "ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0.html ESA's water mission SMOS] European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"&gt;SMOS Project Team, [http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506200325/http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf |date=2006-05-06 }} European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"&gt;SMOS Special Issue of ESA Bulletin [http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESA_Publications/SEMU9CWX3RF_0.html ESA Bulletin] Special Issue  137, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"&gt;''SMOS: The Challenging Sea Surface Salinity Measurement from Space'', J.

==History==
The project was proposed in November 1998; in 2004 the project passed ESA-phase "C/D" and,&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"&gt;[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/indexsmos.html The Living Planet Program Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (MIRAS on RAMSES)] Mission SMOS at Centre d'Etudes Spatailes de la BIOsphere (CESBIO)&lt;/ref&gt; after several delays, it was launched on 2 November 2009 from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] on a [[Rockot]] rocket.&lt;ref name=bbc &gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=European water mission lifts off | date=2 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8331962.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first data from the [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis|MIRAS]] ([[Microwave]] Imaging [[Radiometer]] using [[Aperture]] Synthesis) instrument was received on 20 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMDGULX82G_index_0.html|title=First SMOS data received|date=20 November 2009|publisher=ESA|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMOS programme cost is about €315 million ($465 million; £280 million). It is led by ESA but with significant input from French and Spanish interests.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The satellite is part of ESA's Earth Explorer programme – eight spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing [[environmental science|environment]]al concern. The first is already in orbit – a mission called [[GOCE]], which is mapping variations in the pull of [[gravity]] across the Earth's surface. SMOS is the second Explorer to launch; and a third spacecraft, known as [[CryoSat-2]] (the first [[CryoSat]] failed on launch), was launched on 8 April 2010. CryoSat will assess the state of the world's ice cover.

==Launcher==
The satellite was launched on 2 November 2009 (04:50 (01:50 GMT)) to a nearly circular orbit of 763&amp;nbsp;km aboard a [[Rokot]], a modified [[Russians|Russian]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) [[SS-19]] launched from a decommissioned SS-19 launcher from Northern Russia's  [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]].&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Smos satellite unfurls instrument | date=3 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8341400.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMOS satellite was launched together with the [[Proba-2]], a technology demonstration satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html Successful launch qualification test for PROBA2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233049/http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97# ESA's SMOS Mission to be launched in July 2009 from Plesetsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061131/http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97 |date=2009-01-26 }} The Rockot Missions.

==Science==
The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4% (at 35–50&amp;nbsp;km [[spatial resolution]]).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt; This aspect is managed by the HYDROS project.  Project Aquarius will attempt to monitor sea surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 [[Practical salinity unit|psu]] (10- to 30-day average and a spatial resolution of 200&amp;nbsp;km x 200&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A. [http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01922/EGU2008-A-01922.pdf?PHPSESSID= ''The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission - An overview'']. Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 10, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SMOS2010.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|alt=Global salinity map (Aug.–Sept. 2010 &amp; 2011) produced by the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. Released 2012.|The first global map of oceanic surface salinity, produced by the SMOS satellite. The salinity varies from 32[[‰]] (deep purple) to 38[[‰]] (bright red).]]
Soil moisture is an important aspect of climate, and therefore [[forecasting]]. Plants transpire water from depths lower than 1 meter in many places and satellites like SMOS can only provide moisture content down to a few centimeters, but using repeated measurements in a day, the satellite can extrapolate soil moisture.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"/&gt;  The SMOS team of ESA hope to work with farmers around the world, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to use as ground-based calibration for models determining soil moisture, as it may help to better understand [[crop yield]]s over wide regions.&lt;ref name = "SD_080424152254"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080424152254.htm How Dry We Are: European Space Agency To Test Earth's Soil Moisture Via Satellite]-Science News, Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean [[salinity]] is crucial to the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate through the global [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The water cycle and Global Warming|url=http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=18912&amp;articleId=35166|publisher=WHOI|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity in combination with temperature determine ocean circulation by defining its density and hence [[thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High-latitude salinity effects and interhemispheric thermohaline circulations|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~jscott/AMOC/bryan_86.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ocean salinity is one of the variables that regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and release and therefore has an effect on the oceanic [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Cycle - NASA Science|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/ocean-earth-system/ocean-carbon-cycle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Information from SMOS is expected to help improve short and medium-term weather forecasts, and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management.  In addition, climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The SMOS satellite carries a new type of instrument called [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS). Some eight metres across, it has the look of helicopter rotor blades; the instrument creates images of radiation emitted in the [[microwave]] [[L-band]] (1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz). MIRAS will measure changes in the wetness of the land and in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"/&gt;

===Operations and ground segment===
The [[CNES]] Satellite Operations [[ground segment|Ground Segment]] will operate the spacecraft with telecommunications from ESA's [[S-band]] facility located in [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The Data Processing Ground Segment ([[Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology|CDTI]], [[Villafranca]], [[Spain]]) will process SMOS data through the [[X-band]]. Higher level processing of information will be done by scientists globally.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">'''Strategic sustainable investing''' ('''SSI''') is an [[investment strategy]] that recognizes and rewards leading companies that are moving society towards [[sustainability]]. SSI relies on a consensus-based scientific definition of [[sustainability]], and the assumption that ‘''[[Backcasting]] from Principles of Sustainability''’,&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J and Robèrt, K-H “Backcasting from non-overlapping sustainability principles – a framework for strategic planning”, International .Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 7:1–18. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a vision of a sustainable future is set as the reference point for developing strategic actions, is the preferred approach to strategically move a company towards sustainability. It was developed by researchers at the [[Blekinge Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.

==The strategic sustainable investment system==
SSI outlines that the financial investment will offer a competitive risk-adjusted return, while providing investment capital to companies that are actively attempting to become more sustainable. It implies lower exposure to sustainability-related risks and it considers financial metrics together with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, as well as strategy analyses to educate investment decision-making.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;[http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/535439ccd73cc824c1256608004f0529/a6dcb300241ca812c125746000500631!OpenDocument Blandford, Nick, Timothy Nash and André Winter “Strategic Sustainable Investing: Recognizing Value in Transitional Leadership.” Master's thesis, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of SSI:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lower sustainability risk exposure &lt;br /&gt;
•	A definition of sustainability based on scientific consensus&lt;ref name= "tools and concepts"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFX-44KVV9J-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=214b19c668891d8b85307af38cb9017c Robèrt, K.-H. “Tools and concepts for sustainable development, how do they relate to a framework for sustainable development, and to each other?” Journal of Cleaner Production 8: 243–254. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Primarily driven by movement towards sustainability&lt;br /&gt;
•	Considers financial, ESG, and strategy analysis

SSI operates by prioritizing investment capital allocation to companies that are taking the lead in shifting away from unsustainable behaviour towards new ways of doing business. This capital allocation will provide an incentive for companies to move forward in a sustainable direction. This movement is reported in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and other extra-financial reports, but is also recorded in traditional areas of a firm’s financial [[balance sheets]].

By incorporating sustainability investment and returns into traditional financial reporting, a clearer picture of the bottom-line impact of a company’s actions towards sustainability is made available. In this positive reinforcing loop, greater investor returns and [http://plilend.com/ increased movement towards sustainability] are generated with every cycle.

[[Image:Economic analysis chart of movement towards sustainability.jpg|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[Causal loop diagram]] illustrating the strategic sustainable investment''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s, such as mutual and pension funds, take a longer-term position on investments and are thus ideally suited to incorporate SSI strategies.

==Theory background==
The theoretical foundation of SSI is strongly linked to ''strategic sustainable development'', made popular by [[The Natural Step]] and its founder Dr. [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]].

This strategy resembles [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI), a growing practice amongst ethical investors. Nevertheless, SSI recognizes the gaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsibleinvesting.org/database/dokuman/SRI%20Report%2010-04_word.pdf Hawken, P. “How the SRI industry has failed to respond to people who want to invest with conscience and what can be done to change it.” Natural Capital Institute. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; of SRI pointed by several academics and practitioners and presents some alternatives.

==SSI analysis tool==
In order to evolve current SRI and traditional investment practices into Strategic Sustainable Investment, two gaps must be considered:

a.	The recognition of companies with true leading strategies for a sustainable future&lt;br /&gt;
b.	A robust and well defined link must be made between movement towards sustainability and higher investment returns

The SSI analysis tool addresses the first gap by measuring a company’s strategy for addressing sustainability. It allows investors to recognize which companies are leading the transition in a new direction, and which are most likely to be strong performers in tomorrow’s market.

This tool is divided in two main parts: the emerging sustainability issue (esi) chart and the strategy analysis component:

===ESI chart===
[[Image:ESI Chart.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ESI Chart Sample&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]
The Sectoral Emerging Sustainability Issue (ESI) chart is used to identify which aspects of a determined market sector will become a socio-environmental problem. In the common sense, an issue is called ‘emergent’ when it gets media exposure. Instead, the Tool relies on scientific [[The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability|Principles of sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., and K.-H. Robèrt “The Rationale behind the System Conditions”. Department of Physical Resource Theory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., K-H. Robèrt, and K-E. Eriksson “Socio-ecological principles for sustainability”. Getting down to earth — Practical applications of ecological economics. Washington, DC: Island Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to identify what is emergent.

It exposes which Sustainability Issues present high risks for companies within that sector in the short-term; as well as which Issues will be emerging in the medium and long-terms. Due to differences within a sector, the Sectoral ESI Chart should be made as specific as needed, being flexible to account for various geographical locations and sub-sector subtleties.

The process of composing an ESI chart follows:

Once a sector is selected for an ESI analysis, a list of relevant sustainability issues is assembled. This baseline analysis will result in a list of issues outlining the subject sector’s strengths and concerns that impact society and the environment. Next, prioritization colours are assigned to each sustainability issue: red for very high priority; orange for high priority; yellow for medium priority, and green for low priority according to its assessment in each of three categories: urgency, severity, and systematic contribution.

''Urgency'' assesses the time frame pressing each Issue. The ''severity'' assesses the seriousness of the Issue, in terms of its potential consequences for the environment, society, and companies within that sector. The ''systematic contribution'' is used to gauge the sector’s contribution to the overall Issue.

[[Image:ESI WF.jpg|none|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''To fill out the Chart, Researchers follow this process flow.''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

===Strategy analysis component===
====Strategic plan====
The Strategic Plan element assesses the subject company’s planned goals in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI). The qualitative description includes, but is not limited to, information regarding:  public commitments planned operational and business initiatives, political action/ lobbying, and third party partnerships (with NGOs, consultative firms etc.). There is also a comment on the subject company’s core business in relation to the ESI; as this will assist in determining the subject company’s exposure to the emerging risk.

====Strategic actions====
The strategic actions element looks at assessing the subject company’s recent actions taken in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI), thus determining whether the subject company is ‘walking the talk’ in comparison to the vision and goals outlined.
The subject company’s actions are seen through the lens of [[strategic sustainable development]], and thus three questions are emphasized as a mental guideline:

a.	Does this action provide a competitive return on investment (ROI)?&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Is this action taking the subject company in the right direction?&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Is this action a versatile platform?

====Strategy analysis graph====
The strategy analysis graph shows the subject company’s planned path for dealing with the ESI, tangible progress made, and if existent, government regulations. The trajectory of the subject company’s planned path reveals the extent of their future risk exposure. This graph is placed in the center of the strategy analysis page.

'''Sust 'n' Able''' is the [[Woodcraft Folk]]'s programme of education for [[sustainable development]].
[[Image:sustnable.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sust'N'Able Logo]]

The project was the theme of the Woodcraft Folk's 2001 international camp in [[Nottinghamshire]] where 4,000 young people attended. The camp focused on sustainable development education and ran activates for children from five to twenty five around the themes.

At the camp a simulation game took place called '''World on a Tight Rope'', it ran the length of the camp and involved people working for credits to create a more sustainable world. The simulation included two 'Earth Summits' held at the camp to come up with a declaration to the world's leaders at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). The Earth Summit had "action stations" where people debated the issues to be included in the declaration.

==The declaration and delegation==
The Declaration created as part of the simulation game was presented by a delegation of 11 young people. The delegation attended the [[United Nations]]' [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] including both the civil society and the official political areas of the summit. The group worked with the [[International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International]] delegation attending the summit.

Delegations from Woodcraft Folk attend all the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] meetings in [[New York City]] which are follow-up meetings to the annual WSSD, with thematic cycles changing every two years.

'''''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''''' is a 2003 book by the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]], published by [[Joseph Henry Press]].&lt;ref name="jhp"&gt;Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first section of the book, Bailey discusses gender-atypical behaviors and [[gender dysphoria]] in children, emphasizing the biological determination of gender.  In the second section he deals primarily with gay men, including the link between childhood gender dysphoria and male [[homosexuality]] later in life. Bailey reviews evidence that male homosexuality is congenital (a result of genetics and [[Prenatal#Prenatal period|prenatal]] environment), and he argues for the accuracy of some [[stereotype]]s about gay men.&lt;ref name="Bailey76"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third section, Bailey summarizes evidence for a [[psychological typology]] of [[trans women]] that says there are two forms of [[transsexualism]] that affects transgender women: one that he describes as an extreme type of male homosexuality and one that is a sexual interest in having a female body, called [[autogynephilia]].

The book caused considerable controversy which led to complaints and a formal investigation by [[Northwestern University]], where Bailey was chair of the psychology department until shortly before the conclusion of the investigation. Northwestern ultimately found no basis for the complaints,&lt;ref name="Dreger2008"&gt;{{cite journal

==Summary==

''The Man Who Would Be Queen'' is divided into three sections: "The Boy Who Would Be Princess", "The Man He Might Become", and "Women Who Once Were Boys".

It starts with an anecdote about a child Bailey calls "Danny". Bailey writes of Danny's mother, who has been frustrated by other therapists she has seen about her son's "feminine" behavior.&lt;ref name="bailey16"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist [[Kenneth Zucker]]'s work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors.  Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe [[gender identity disorder]], a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as [[cross-dressing]]. For example, this class includes boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with [[toy car]]s and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.

The second section deals primarily with gay men, including a suggested link between childhood [[gender identity disorder]] and male homosexuality later in life. Bailey discusses whether homosexuality is a congenitally or possibly even genetically related phenomenon. This discussion includes references to Bailey's studies as well as those of neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] and geneticist [[Dean Hamer]]. He also discusses the behavior of gay men and its stereotypically masculine and feminine qualities.

In the third section, Bailey summarizes a taxonomy of transsexual women that was proposed by [[Ray Blanchard]] about fifteen years earlier. According to Blanchard, there are two types of transsexual women: one described as an extreme form of male homosexuality, the other being motivated by [[autogynephilia|a sexual interest in having a female body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Clemmensen | first2 = L.

==Reception==
The book elicited both strongly supportive and strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included the contents of the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to [[Benedict Carey]]'s story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of [[political correctness]] on [[academic freedom]]."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt; Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] argues that "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

However, critics such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]] think that the pointed criticism, including filing charges, was warranted: "Nothing we have done, I believe, and certainly nothing I have done, overstepped any boundaries of fair comment on a book and an author who stepped into the public arena with enthusiasm to deliver a false and unscientific and politically damaging opinion".&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;  The concern over academic freedom was dismissed by Charles Allen Moser, who wrote: "The death of free speech and academic freedom has been highly exaggerated. Science is not free of politics, never has been, and never will be."&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;

===Positive reactions===
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded: "Despite its provocative title, a scientific yet superbly compassionate exposition."&lt;ref name="napsales"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10530 The Man Who Would Be Queen] via [[National Academies Press]].

===Negative reactions from the transgender community===

The public response of members of the transgender community was almost entirely negative.&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; Among other things, they opposed the book's endorsement of [[Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory|Blanchard's taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]],&lt;ref name="klein2004"&gt;Klein, Julie M.

=== Negative reactions from outside the transgender community ===
Negative responses came from outside the transgender community as well. Liza Mundy of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' thought the book exceptionally dull despite the potentially interesting topic.&lt;ref name="mundy2003"&gt;Mundy, Liza (March 23, 2003). Codes of Behavior. ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Eli Coleman]] referred to the book as "an unfortunate setback in feelings of trust between the transgender community and sex researchers,"&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; and his colleague, Walter Bockting, wrote that it was "yet another blow to the delicate relationship between clinicians, scholars, and the transgender community."&lt;ref name="bockting2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bockting | first1 = Walter O. | year = 2005 | title = Biological reductionism meets gender diversity in human sexuality. [Review of the book The Man Who Would Be Queen.] | doi = 10.1080/00224490509552281 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 267–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] Director [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] said the book promoted a derogatory explanation of transgender identity that would hurt many vulnerable transgender people, and that the book, which was written in a [[popular science]] style, did not support the material in a scientific manner.&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; Psychologist [[Randi Ettner]] said of Bailey, "He's set back the field 100 years, as far as I'm concerned."&lt;ref name="klein2004" /&gt;

Originally, the [[Lambda Literary Award|Lambda Literary Foundation]] nominated the book as a finalist in the [[transgender]] award category for 2003. Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in just a few days. Under pressure from the petition, the Foundation withdrew the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004/03/16/3 |title = Group rescinds honor for disputed book |first = Patrick |last = Letellier |authorlink =  |date = 2004-03-16 |work = Gay.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505120340/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004%2F03%2F16%2F3 |archivedate = 2008-05-05 |accessdate = 2010-01-10 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Northwestern University professor of clinical medical humanities and [[bioethics]] [[Alice Dreger]] commented on Bailey's response to the negative reactions: "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but given the number of people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive.

One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy.

===Allegations against Bailey===

==== Alleged lack of formal written consent in interviews ====
Two of the transsexual women in Bailey's book, two who mistakenly thought they were represented in the book, and several organizations have accused him of ethical breaches in his work by talking to them about their life stories without obtaining formal written consent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin. "Transsexual 'Subjects' Complain About Professor's Research Methods." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' 25 July 2003, Vol. 49, Issue 46. ''"The book contains numerous observations and reports of interviews with me", C. Anjelica Kieltyka, one of the transsexual women, wrote in a letter this month to C. Bradley Moore, Northwestern's vice president for research. She added: "I did not receive, nor was I asked to sign, an informed-consent document."''&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the people were aware that Bailey was writing a book about trans women at the time of the interviews: some of them read the drafts of the book before publication,&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; and several said they felt their stories had been told "accurately and sympathetically."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; Bailey has denied that it is unethical for a university professor to talk to people in the same manner that [[journalist]]s do, or to write books with the resulting anecdotes. He also stated that the book was "popular and not 'scientific'"  so it was not required to follow IRB rules.&lt;ref name="McCarthyism" /&gt;

According to Dreger, whether federal regulations required professors to obtain formal approval from a university [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) before interviewing people was uncertain at the time;&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; she points out that shortly after publication of this book, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], conducting interviews, collecting anecdotes, and similar activities do not constitute IRB-qualified research, and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules, when such work is "neither systematic nor generalizable in the scientific sense."&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{Cite book

==== Alleged practice of psychology without a license ====
Also as cited as harassment of Bailey were legal complaints that Bailey was [[practicing psychology without a license]]. The basis for these complaints was that [[sex-reassignment surgery]] in the US requires authorization letters from two psychologists, and Bailey had written a second letter, at no charge and upon request, for some individuals Bailey had spoken with while writing the book. American bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] notes that there was no legal basis for this claim, as Bailey received no compensation for his services, and was forthright in this letters about his qualifications, even attaching copies of his C.V: "Presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge, although you’d never know that from reading the press accounts, which mentioned only the complaints, not that they had petered out."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; State regulators took no action on these complaints.&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kf1ZwDifdAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=urmonotheism |title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|page=136|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=1-85075-657-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;

Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

{{One source|date=March 2008}}

The '''Vijayanagara musicological nonet''' or the '''''Sangitashastra navaratna''''' are a group of nine musicological treatises written during the reign of the [[Vijayanagara empire]].  These works are counted among the most important and definitive treatises in [[Carnatic music]] theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Each of these works contributed seminally to the growth of the [[Carnatic music]] tradition.  These nine works are the ''Sangitasara'' by the sage [[Vidyaranya]], ''Taladipika'' by Salva Gopa Tippendra, ''Sangitakalanidhi'' by Kallinatha, Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary on the ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', Bhandaru Lakshminarayana's ''Sangitasuryodaya'', Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi'' and the much celebrated ''[[Swaramelakalanidhi]]'' by Ramamatya.

==Historical milieu==
The reign of [[Vijayanagara empire]] was a watershed period in the cultural history of South India, particularly the history of Carnatic music.  The period witnessed the prolific contributions of numerous musicians, saints and theoreticians.  By virtue of the geo-political influence it exerted, Vijayanagara had become the confluence of many religions, art forms and cultures.  Society and culture went through a process of conflict and eclectic assimilation of the traditional and elite values on the one hand and the emerging folk and foreign influences on the other.  There was a strong interaction between traditional and elite values on the one hand and folk and foreign influences on the other.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Much of this was also the result of a reaction and revolt against emerging sociological and aesthetic trends.  Even as this assimilation and nativization of the contending or opposing influences took place, traditional purity and historical continuity continued to be preserved.  These cultural trends and objectives were later sustained and fostered in the several feudatory states that continued to thrive beyond the fall of the Vijayanagar empire.  Some of the notable states included Anegundi, Penukonda, Tanjore, [[Mysore Kingdom]], Madurai, [[Keladi Nayaka|Ikkeri]] etc.,.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Innovations in theory and practice==
A wide range of experiments and innovations were carried out in the field of instruments too.  The [[Tanpura (instrument)|Tamburi]] introduced during the period soon became the principal drone instrument.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Seminal work and innovations also took place in the Vina keyboards with regard to the accordatura, tonal range and instrumental parameters. The ''mela'' replaced the ''grama'' and it's the theoretical possibilities were fully explored through mathematical schemes of tabulation.  The innovation of the concept of ''mela'' and organization of the entirety of contemporary melodic material under its umbrella culminated in Venkatamakhin's ''Melakarta'' scheme, one which continues to influence greatly the theory and practice of Carnatic music to this day.  New classificatory models emerged for ragas; &lt;!--through psychoacoustical principles of temperament.--&gt; ''svayambhusvara'' (upper partials), ''paryaya-svara'' (alternative svara denomination) and ''pratinidhi-svara'' (representative note) scales and intervals were tuned to be brought into alignment with contemporary musical practice.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Various melodic and rhythmic structures found their way art music.  All music became ''desi'' and ''marga'' music passed into oblivion as did the ''madhyamagrama'' and its paraphernalia. The totality of melody came to be referred to ''sadja grama'' alone. The arbitrary, archaic and prolific ''desi talas'' made way for the suladi talas engendered by the [[Haridasa]]s.  These were further refined based on the principles of the ten vital elements called ''taladasaprana''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} &lt;!--Theoretical and pedagogical scalar standards, as well as propaedeutic exercises (''abhyasagana'') which are relevant even today, were the contributions of  Vijayanagara.--&gt;

==Prominent composers==
At the height of the Vijayanagara empire great saint-composers like [[Purandara Dasa]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vyasatirtha|Vyasaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Kanaka Dasa]], Tallapakam [[Annamacharya]] and his descendants, and Nijagunashivayogi flourished. Musical forms, the ''Kriti'', the ''Suladi'', the ''Ugabhoga'', the ''Dandaka'', the ''Urttanama'', the ''Namavali'', the ''Mundige'', the ''Gita'', the ''Thaya'' and the ''Prabandha'' developed and found wide currency during this period.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==The 'nonet'==
Throughout the Vijayanagara period, theory and musical practice kept pace with each other closely. Great musicologists like Vidyaranya, Salva Gopa Tippendra, Kallinatha, Kumbhakarna, Ramamatya, Laksmanarayana, Pandarika Vittala, Somanatha, Locana Jha and Hrdayanarayanadeva contributed to musical theory of both North and South India during this period.  Tanappacharya, [[Govinda Dikshita]] and Venkatamakhin made foundational contributions from Tanjore about a century later. Each work of these scholars records a revolutionary and seminal concept or development which cumulatively resulted in modern Carnatic music.  Nine musicological treatises of great significance were composed in the Vijayanagar period and these have been called the Vijayanagara ''Sangitashastra Navaratna'' or the 'Vijayanagara Musicological Nonet'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The first of the ''navaratnas'' is Vidyaranya's ''Sangitasara'', composed in the second half of the fourteenth century.  The work dealt with, among other things, the fifteen ''melas'' and their fifty ''janya ragas'' as well as certain types of singers.  Some of this even found its way into Govinda Dikshita's ''Sangitasudha'' (''nidhi''), authored in the early seventeenth century.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Taladipika
The second of the nonet (chronologically) is the ''Taladipika''.  Authored in the mid-fifteenth century by Salva Gopa-Tippendra, brother-in-law of king [[Deva Raya II|Praudha Devaraya II]] and a viceroy of [[Kolar district|Mulbagal]], the work deals at great length with the [[Tala (music)|tala]]. It describes over a hundred desi talas including some of the author's own inventions.  Most importantly, the concept of ''taladasaprana'' (ten vital elements of tala) is elucidated  for the first time in the work. This innovation was to prove so influential that, following its explication, all temporal activities in music and dance came to be organized and consolidated under these elements.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Sangitakalanidhi
To the same period belongs the third work of the Nonet, Kallinatha's''Sangitakalanidhi'', a versatile commentary on [[Sarangadeva|Sharngadeva]]'s ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', the encyclopedic magnum opus on Indian music.  It was about dancing and aesthetics of the thirteenth century. In the work, Kallinatha meticulously annotated, explicated, criticised and emphasised all the central issues of the ''Ratnakara''; he also illumined it through comparison with contemporary practices, theories and norms of music and dance. He anticipated many developments in these arts.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary
A Telugu commentary by Bhandaru (-ri?) Vittaleshwara on the ''Sangitaratnakara'' in the last quarter of the fifteenth century forms the fourth of the ''navaratnas''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}
 
;Sangitasuryodaya
In 1525, Vittaleshwara's son Bhandaru (ri?) Lakshminarayana composed the fifth treatise, the ''Sangitasuryodaya'', under the patronage of king [[Krishnadevaraya]] of Vijayanagara.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi
In the generation that immediately followed, Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi''/''Talakalavridhi'' was written.  This was an important treatise on ''tala''. This work organizes for the first time the theory and practice of the ''suladi talas'' of the Haridasas in terms of the ''dasapranas''. In the work, he also compiles views from several earlier works on ''tala'' such as Talakalavilasa, Sangitavidyavinoda, Jainamata, Sangitamarga, Chaturasabhavilasa, Sangitachudamani, Anjaneyamata, Nrttachudamani, Sangitamanidarpana, Katyayaniya, Sangitarnava, Rangaraja Bharatabhashya, Kapardi, and Parameshvara (all of them non-extant), and refutes them. 
Further, Achyutaraya applies all the five ''laghu-jatis'' to each ''suladi tala'' and thereby expands the scope and function of the ''suladi talas''.  Around the same time, Ashtavadana Somabhatta composed the ''Svararagasudharasa'' or ''Natyachudamani'' under the guidance of his guru Sitarama and probably under Achyutaraya's patronage. This work is now available only in fragments.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Swaramelakalanidhi
The final 'gem' in the series is the much celebrated ''[[Svaramelakalanidhi]]'' authored by the illustrious Kallinatha's grandson, Ramamatya ca. 1550.  Ramamatya was the royal composer and architect in the court of de facto king [[Aliya Rama Raya]].&lt;ref name="kall"&gt;Moorthy (2001), p 27&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as ''abhinavabharatacharya'' and ''todara-malla'' (meaning "the hero(malla) who wears the honorific anklet(''todar'')). The last epithet however, is usually interpreted by scholars as alluding to the Todarmal, a minister in Akbar's court, the anachronism notwithstanding.  The Kannada term, in fact translates to 'the hero (malla) who wears the honorific anklet (todar)'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

''Svaramelakalanidhi'' importance lies in the fact that it is more relevant and related to modern practice than the books written prior to it.  The work, spread over five chapters deals primarily with ''Raga'' and preliminary to it, describes the ''Mela-s'' for the classification of ''Raga'' - and the different ''Suddha svara-s'' and ''Vikrta svara-s'' constituting the ''Mela-s''. Similar works by other celebrated contemporaries like Pandarika Vitthala and Somanatha project a common theme, namely the description of ''Ragas'', classification under ''Melas'' and the enumeration of the ''Suddha'' and ''Vikrta svaras'' constituting the ''Melas''.  Minor ideological differences can however be discerned among these works.&lt;ref name="nram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicresearch.in/categorydetails.php?imgid=7 |title=Svaramelakalanidhi of Ramamatya |author=N Ramanathan |accessdate=2008-02-21 |publisher=[MusicResearch.in]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Svaramelakalanidhi'' brings the theory up to date, rationalizes intervals and scales, introduces the concepts of ''svayambhu-svara'' (self-generating note, upper partial), ''.dharashruti paryayatattva'' and ''pratinidhitattva'' of ''svaras''.  ''Mukhari'' is established as the ''shuddhasvara saptaka''.  It also fixes and standardizes musical intervals on the keyboard, defines the accordatura, range, preferred strings (for particular notes) etc., for a variety of stringed keyboards.  It also innovates and dedicates a new keyboard to Achyutaraya.  A new scheme for classifying ragas into ''uttama'' (superior), ''madhyama'' (middling) and ''adhama'' (inferior) on the basis of their expressive potential is also expounded in the work.  It also resolves the problem of the ''antara'' and ''kaishiki'' notes.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

'''William Henry Paine Hatch''' (August 2, 1875 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] theologian and [[New Testament]] scholar, born at [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N. J.]] He attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]], graduating in 1898 (Ph.D., 1904). Afterward, he graduated the [[Episcopal Divinity School|Episcopal Theological School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the [[General Theological Seminary]] in [[City of New York|New York City]]. He was ordained to the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priesthood in 1902. Hatch was awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity]] from [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York and a D.Théol. from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He was Professor of the Literature and Interpretation of the New Testament at the [[Episcopal Divinity School|Episcopal Theological School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Hatch published many articles and reviews and was the author of ''The Pauline Idea of Faith'' (1917), and, with C. C. Edmunds, ''The Gospel Manuscripts of the General Theological Seminary'' (1918).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Zeitlin''' (c. 1850 – 1921, in [[Leipzig]]) was a Russian scholar and bibliographer born at [[Homel]], government (''[[guberniya]]'') of [[Moghilef]], about the middle of the 19th century. He is known especially as the author of ''Kiryat Sefer,'' or ''Bibliotheca Hebraica Post-Mendelssohniana'' (Leipzig, 1891–95), a bibliographical dictionary of modern [[Hebrew literature]] from the beginning of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s epoch until 1890. The compilation of this work occupied Zeitlin for twenty years. He made extensive use of [[Benjacob]]'s ''Otzar ha-Sefarim'' and of [[Julius Fürst|Fürst]]'s ''Bibliotheca Judaica'', and visited [[Vilna]] and [[Warsaw]], the centers of the Hebrew book market, as well as many university cities—as [[Königsberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]]—from the libraries of which he gathered additional material for his work.

The ''Qiryat Sefer'' indexes not only works in book form, but also important periodical articles, biographical sketches, and scientific essays, in addition to giving biographical notes on several authors. Zeitlin had previously prepared an index of works written on the [[Hebrew calendar]], in which he enumerates seventy-seven Hebrew works; this index was published by [[Chayyim Jonah Gurland]] in ''Yevreiski Kalendar'' (St. Petersburg, 1882). In the ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' (ix.3-4) Zeitlin has published an alphabetical list of anagrams and pseudonyms of modern Hebrew writers; he was also a contributor to several Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographical articles.

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
