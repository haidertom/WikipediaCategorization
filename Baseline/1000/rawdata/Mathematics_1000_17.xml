 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

An '''abstract structure''' is a [[formal object]] that is defined by a set of laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.  Abstract structures are studied not only in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] but in the fields that apply them, as [[computer science]], and in the studies that reflect on them, such as [[philosophy]] (especially the [[philosophy of mathematics]]).  Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group: see discussion there, at [[algebraic structure]] and also [[structure (category theory)|structure]]).

An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects{{snd}} this is called an implementation or [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a [[concept]] or an [[idea]]. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of [[democracy]], but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess.   

==Examples==   
* A [[sorting algorithm]] is an abstract structure, but a [[recipe]] is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
* A simple [[melody]] is an abstract structure, but an [[orchestration]] is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
* [[Euclidean geometry]] is an abstract structure, but the theory of [[continental drift]] is not, because it depends on the geology of the [[Earth]].
* A [[formal language]] is an abstract structure, but a [[natural language]] is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''Benacerraf's identification problem''' is a [[philosophical argument]], developed by [[Paul Benacerraf]], against [[set-theoretic Platonism]].&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;Paul Benacerraf (1965), “What Numbers Could Not Be”, ''Philosophical Review'' Vol. 74, pp. 47–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, Benacerraf published a [[Paradigm shift|paradigm changing]] article entitled "What Numbers Could Not Be".&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale and Crispin Wright (2002) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.9943&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Benacerraf's Dilemma Revisited"] ''European Journal of Philosophy'', '''10'''(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the work became a significant catalyst in motivating the development of [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|mathematical structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Shapiro (1997) ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology'' New York: Oxford University Press, p. 37. {{ISBN|0195139305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification problem argues that there exists a fundamental problem in [[Reductionism|reducing]] [[natural numbers]] to [[pure sets]].  Since there exists an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of ways of identifying the natural numbers with pure sets, no particular set-theoretic method can be determined as the "true" reduction.  Benacerraf infers that any attempt to make such a choice of reduction immediately results in generating a meta-level, set-theoretic falsehood, namely in relation to other [[Elementarily equivalent|elementarily-equivalent]] set-theories not [[Law of identity|identical]] to the one chosen.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The identification problem argues that this creates a fundamental problem for Platonism, which maintains that mathematical objects have a real, abstract existence.  '''Benacerraf's dilemma'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; to Platonic set-theory is arguing that the Platonic attempt to identify the "true" reduction of natural numbers to pure sets, as revealing the [[intrinsic properties]] of these abstract mathematical objects, is impossible.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  As a result, the identification problem ultimately argues that the relation of set theory to natural numbers cannot have an [[Ontology|ontologically]] Platonic nature.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;

== Historical motivations ==

The historical motivation for the development of Benacerraf's identification problem derives from a fundamental problem of ontology.  Since [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains [[abstract objects]].  In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loux (2006) ''Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction'' (Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy), London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0415401348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional mathematical Platonism maintains that some set of mathematical elements–[[natural numbers]], [[real numbers]], [[Functions (mathematics)|functions]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[systems]]–are such abstract objects.  Contrarily, mathematical [[nominalism]] denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics.  
   
In the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity.  These included [[intuitionism]], [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[predicativism]].  By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues.  This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism.  It was in this historic context that the motivations for the identification problem developed.

== Description ==

The identification problem begins by evidencing some set of elementarily-equivalent, set-theoretic models of the natural numbers.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf considers two such set-theoretic methods:

::'''Set-theoretic method I''' (using [[Zermelo ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

::'''Set-theoretic method II''' (using [[von Neumann ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

As Benacerraf demonstrates, both method I and II reduce natural numbers to sets.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf formulates the dilemma as a question: which of these set-theoretic methods uniquely provides the true identity statements, which elucidates the true ontological nature of the natural numbers?&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Either method I or II could be used to define the natural numbers and subsequently generate true arithmetical statements to form a mathematical system.  In their relation, the elements of such mathematical systems are [[isomorphic]] in their structure.  However, the problem arises when these isomorphic structures are related together on the meta-level.  The definitions and arithmetical statements from system I are not identical to the definitions and arithmetical statements from system II.  For example, the two systems differ in their answer to whether 0 ∈ 2, insofar as ∅ is not an element of {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}.  Thus, in terms of failing the [[transitivity of identity]], the search for true identity statements similarly fails.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt; By attempting to reduce the natural numbers to sets, this renders a set-theoretic falsehood between the isomorphic structures of different mathematical systems.  This is the essence of the identification problem.

According to Benacerraf, the philosophical ramifications of this identification problem result in Platonic approaches failing the ontological test.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The argument is used to demonstrate the impossibility for Platonism to reduce numbers to sets that reveals the existence of abstract objects.

He puts on (the circular site) four (bricks) running eastwards 1; two behind running crosswise (from south to north), and two (such) in front. Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts 2. The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and where the body is that (includes) the head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the East: The Satapatha-Brahmana, pt. 3|year=1894|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=303}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conditional proof''' is a [[formal proof|proof]] that takes the form of asserting a [[Material conditional|conditional]], and proving that the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional necessarily leads to the [[consequent]]. 

==Overview==
The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the '''conditional proof assumption'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''CPA''').  Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion [[Logical consequence|necessarily follows]]. The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that ''if it were true'' it would lead to the consequent.

Conditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.

A famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory.  There are a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them. Similarly, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] has a large number of consequences already proven.

== Symbolic logic ==
As an example of a conditional proof in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], suppose we want to prove A → C (if A, then C) from the first two premises below:

{|
|-
|align=right| 1. || A → B&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || ("If A, then B")
|-
|align=right| 2. || B → C || ("If B, then C")
|-
|colspan=3| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
|align=right| 3. || A ||(conditional proof assumption, "Suppose A is true")
|-
|align=right| 4. || B || (follows from lines 1 and 3, [[modus ponens]]; "If A then B; A, therefore B")
|-
|align=right| 5. || C || (follows from lines 2 and 4, [[modus ponens]]; "If B then C; B, therefore C")
|-
|align=right| 6. || A → C || (follows from lines 3–5, conditional proof; "If A, then C")
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16709">'''Conway chained arrow notation''', created by mathematician [[John Horton Conway]], is a means of expressing certain extremely [[large numbers]]. It is simply a finite sequence of [[positive integers]] separated by rightward arrows, e.g. 2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;6.

As with most [[combinatorial]] notations, the definition is [[recursion|recursive]]. In this case the notation eventually resolves to being the leftmost number raised to some (usually enormous) integer power.

==Definition and overview==
A "Conway chain" is defined as follows:
* Any positive integer is a chain of length 1.
* A chain of length ''n'', followed by a right-arrow → and a positive integer, together form a chain of length &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;.

Any chain represents an integer, according to the four rules below. Two chains are said to be equivalent if they represent the same integer.

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers, and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a subchain, then:
# An empty chain (or a chain of length 0) represents 1, and the chain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represents the number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;p \to q&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[exponentiation|exponential]] expression &lt;math&gt;p^q&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that Conway in ''The Book of Numbers''&lt;ref&gt;John H. Conway &amp; Richard K. Guy, The Book of Numbers, 1996, p.59-62&lt;/ref&gt; leaves the 2-tuple &lt;math&gt;p\rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; undefined, but has the 3rd parameter [''r'' in &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow q \rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt;] count Knuth's arrows, so that this rule actually follows from the axiom to drop the &lt;math&gt;\to 1&lt;/math&gt; from the right end.)
# &lt;math&gt;X \to 1&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;X \to p \to (q + 1)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X \to ( X \to ( \cdots (X \to ( X ) \to q)\cdots ) \to q ) \to q&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(with ''p'' copies of ''X'', ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 copies of ''q'', and ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 pairs of parentheses; applies for ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0).

Note that the last rule can be restated recursively to avoid the [[ellipsis|ellipses]]:
:4a. &lt;math&gt;X \to 1 \to (q + 1) = X&lt;/math&gt;
:4b. &lt;math&gt;X \to (p + 1) \to (q + 1) = X \to (X \to p \to (q+1)) \to q&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
# A chain of length 3 corresponds to [[hyperoperation]] and [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]:
#:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
p \to q \to r = p [r+2] q = p \!\!\! &amp; \underbrace{ \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow \dots \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow } &amp; \!\!\! q = p\uparrow^r q.\\
&amp; \!\!\! r \text{ arrows} \!\!\!
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# a chain ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is of the form ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p''; hence:
# a chain starting with ''a'' is a power of ''a''
# a chain 1&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is equal to 1
# a chain ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is equal to ''X''
# a chain 2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is equal to 4
# a chain ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2 is equal to ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;(''X'') (chain ''X'' with its value concatenated to it)

==Interpretation==
One must be careful to treat an arrow chain ''as a whole''. Arrow chains do not describe the iterated application of a binary operator. Whereas chains of other infixed symbols (e.g. 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7) can often be considered in fragments (e.g. (3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(6&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7)) without a change of meaning (see [[associativity]]), or at least can be evaluated step by step in a prescribed order, e.g. 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from right to left, that is not so with Conway's arrow.

For example:
* &lt;math&gt;2\rightarrow3\rightarrow2 = 2\uparrow\uparrow3 = 2^{2^2} = 16&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2\rightarrow\left(3\rightarrow2\right) = 2^{(3^2)} = 2^{3^2} = 512&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\left(2\rightarrow3\right)\rightarrow2 = \left(2^3\right)^2 = 64&lt;/math&gt;

The fourth rule is the core: A chain of 3 or more elements ending with 2 or higher becomes a chain of the same length with a (usually vastly) increased penultimate element. But its ''ultimate'' element is decremented, eventually permitting the third rule to shorten the chain. After, to paraphrase [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]], "much detail", the chain is reduced to two elements and the second rule terminates the recursion.

==Examples==
Examples get quite complicated quickly. Here are some small examples:

''n''
:= ''n'' (by rule 1)

''p→q''
:= ''p&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' (by rule 2)
:Thus 3→4 = 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 81

1→(''any arrowed expression'')
:= 1 since the entire expression eventually reduces to 1&lt;sup&gt;number&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. (Indeed, any chain containing a 1 can be truncated just before that 1; e.g. ''X''→1→''Y''=''X'' for any (embedded) chains ''X,Y''.)

4→3→2
:= 4→(4→(4)→1)→1 (by 4) and then, working from the inner parentheses outwards,
:= 4→(4→4→1)→1 (remove redundant parentheses (rrp))
:= 4→(4→4)→1 (3)
:= 4→(256)→1 (2)
:= 4→256→1 (rrp)

2→2→4

:= 2→2→3 (rrp)
:= 2→2→2 (4, rrp)
:= 2→2→1 (4, rrp)

:= 2→(2→(2→2→2)→2)→2 (rrp)
:= 2→(2→(4)→2)→2 (previous example)
:= 2→('''2→4→2''')→2 (rrp) ''(expression expanded in next equation shown in bold on both lines)''

:= 2→(2→(2→(2→2)))→2 (3 repeatedly)
:= 2→(2→(2→(4)))→2 (2)
:= 2→(2→(16))→2 (2)
:= 2→65536→2 (2,rrp)
:= 2→(2→(2→(...2→(2→(2)→1)→1...)→1)→1)→1 (4) with 65535 sets of parentheses

:= &lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;2 (See [[tetration]])

2→3→2→2
:= 2→3→(2→3)→1 (by 4)
:= 2→3→8 (2 and 3)

===Systematic examples===
The simplest cases with four terms (containing no integers less than 2) are:
* &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to 2 \to 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to 2 \to (1 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to (a \to b) \to 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to a^b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a [a^b + 2] b&lt;/math&gt;
: (also following from the last-mentioned property)
* &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to 3 \to 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to 3 \to (1 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to (a \to b \to (a \to b) \to 1) \to 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to (a \to b \to a^b)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a [a\to b \to 2 \to 2 + 2] b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to 4 \to 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to (a \to b \to (a \to b \to a^b))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a [a \to b \to 3 \to 2 + 2] b&lt;/math&gt;

We can see a pattern here. If, for any chain ''X'', we let &lt;math&gt;f(p) = X \to p&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X \to p \to 2 = f^p(1)&lt;/math&gt; (see
[[Function composition|functional powers]]).

Applying this with &lt;math&gt;X = a \to b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(p) = a [p + 2]b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to p \to 2 = a [a \to b \to (p - 1) \to 2 + 2] b = f^p(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example, &lt;math&gt;10 \to 6 \to 3\to 2 = 10 [10 [1000002] 6 + 2] 6 &lt;/math&gt;.

Moving on:
* &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to 2 \to 3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to 2 \to (2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to (a \to b) \to 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= a \to b \to a^b \to 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= f^{a^b}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Again we can generalize. When we write &lt;math&gt;g_q(p) = X \to p \to q&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;X \to p \to q+1 = g_q^p(1)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;g_{q+1}(p) = g_q^p(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In the case above, &lt;math&gt;g_2(p) = a \to b \to p \to 2 = f^p(1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_3(p) = g_2^p(1)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;a \to b \to 2 \to 3 = g_3(2) = g_2^2(1) = g_2(g_2(1)) = f^{f(1)}(1) = f^{a^b}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Ackermann function==
The [[Ackermann function]] may be expressed using Conway chained arrow notation:

:''A''(''m'', ''n'') = (2 → (''n'' + 3) → ''(m'' − 2)) − 3 for ''m'' &gt; 2 (Since ''A''(''m'', ''n'') = 2 [''m''] (''n'' + 3) - 3 in [[hyperoperation]])

hence

:2 → ''n'' → ''m'' = ''A''(''m'' + 2,''n'' &amp;minus; 3) + 3 for ''n'' &gt; 2

(''n'' = 1 and ''n'' = 2 would correspond with ''A''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 and ''A''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which could logically be added).

==Graham's number==
[[Graham's number]] &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; itself cannot be expressed concisely in Conway chained arrow notation, but by defining the intermediate function &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow n =  \begin{matrix}
    3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    \text{n arrows}
 \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
&lt;math&gt;G = f^{64}(4)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Function composition#Functional powers|functional powers]]), and
&lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 2 &lt; G &lt; 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 65 \rightarrow 2&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Applying in order the definition, rule 3, and rule 4, we have:

&lt;math&gt;f^{64}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (\cdots (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1))\cdots ))&lt;/math&gt; (with 64 &lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3&lt;/math&gt;'s)
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (\cdots (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3) \rightarrow 1) \cdots ) \rightarrow 1) \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 2;&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
=   &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;\underbrace{\qquad\;\; \vdots \qquad\;\;} \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\uparrow 3
 \end{matrix}
\right\} \text{64 layers}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{64}(4) = G;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (\cdots (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4))\cdots ))&lt;/math&gt; (with 64 &lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3&lt;/math&gt;'s)
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
=   &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;\underbrace{\qquad\;\; \vdots \qquad\;\;} \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3
 \end{matrix}
\right\} \text{64 layers}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{64}(27)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (\cdots (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 27))\cdots ))&lt;/math&gt; (with 64 &lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3&lt;/math&gt;'s)
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (\cdots (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3)))\cdots ))&lt;/math&gt; (with 65 &lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3&lt;/math&gt;'s)
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 65 \rightarrow 2&lt;/math&gt; (computing as above).
:&lt;math&gt;= f^{65}(1)&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
=   &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;\underbrace{\qquad\;\; \vdots \qquad\;\;} \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\uparrow 3
 \end{matrix}
\right\} \text{65 layers}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f'' is [[strictly increasing]],
:&lt;math&gt;f^{64}(1) &lt; f^{64}(4) &lt; f^{64}(27)&lt;/math&gt;
which is the given inequality.

With chain arrows it is very easy to specify a much larger number. For example, note that
:&lt;math&gt; 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 3 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 27 \rightarrow 2) \rightarrow 2\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= f^ {3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 27 \rightarrow 2}(1) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= f^{f^{27}(1)}(1)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
=   &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;\underbrace{\qquad\;\; \vdots \qquad\;\;} \\
    &amp;3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    &amp;3\uparrow 3
 \end{matrix}
\right\}
\left.
 \begin{matrix}
    3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdots\cdots \uparrow}3 \\
    \underbrace{\qquad\;\; \vdots \qquad\;\;} \\
    3\underbrace{\uparrow \uparrow \cdots\cdot \uparrow}3 \\
    3\uparrow 3
 \end{matrix}
\right\} \ 3\uparrow 3 = \text{27 layers}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is much greater than Graham's number, because the number &lt;math&gt;3 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 27 \rightarrow 2&lt;/math&gt; = f&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;(1) is much greater than 65.

== CG function ==
Conway and Guy created a simple, single-argument function that diagonalizes over the entire notation, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;cg(n) = \underbrace{n\rightarrow n\rightarrow n\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow n\rightarrow n\rightarrow n}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

meaning the sequence is:

cg(1) = 1

cg(2) = 2 → 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4

cg(3) = 3 → 3 → 3 = 3↑↑↑3

cg(4) = 4 → 4 → 4 → 4

cg(5) = 5 → 5 → 5 → 5 → 5

...

This function, as one might expect, grows extraordinarily fast.

== Extension by Peter Hurford ==
[[Peter Hurford]] has defined an extension to this notation:

&lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow_b c = \underbrace{a\rightarrow_{b-1} a\rightarrow_{b-1} a\rightarrow_{b-1} \dots \rightarrow_{b-1} a\rightarrow_{b-1} a\rightarrow_{b-1} a}_{c \text{ arrows}}&lt;/math&gt;

All normal rules are unchanged otherwise.

&lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow_2 (a-1)&lt;/math&gt; is already equal to the aforementioned cg(a), and the function &lt;math&gt;f(n) = n \rightarrow_n n&lt;/math&gt; is much faster growing than Conway and Guy's cg(n).

Note that expressions like &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow_b c \rightarrow_d e&lt;/math&gt; are illegal if b and d are different numbers; one chain must only have one type of right-arrow.

However, if we modify this slightly such that:

&lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow_b c \rightarrow_d e = a \rightarrow_b \underbrace{c \rightarrow_{d-1} c \rightarrow_{d-1} c \rightarrow_{d-1} \dots \rightarrow_{d-1} c \rightarrow_{d-1} c \rightarrow_{d-1} c}_{e \text{ arrows}}&lt;/math&gt;

then not only does &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow_b c \rightarrow_d e&lt;/math&gt; become legal, but the notation as a whole becomes much stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/rEzX6|title=Large Numbers, Part 2: Graham and Conway - Greatplay.net|date=2013-06-25|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4290">'''''De vetula''''' ("On the Old Woman") is a long 13th-century [[elegiac comedy]] written in Latin. It is [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphically]] signed "Ovidius", and in its time was attributed to the classical Latin poet [[Ovid]]. It consists of three books of [[hexameter]]s, and was quoted by [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenio Garin]], ''Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life'' (1986 translation), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In its slight plot, the aging Ovid is duped by a go-between, and renounces love affairs.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Binns, ''Ovid'' (1973), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Its interest to modern readers lies in the discursive padding of the story.

==Attribution==

Its actual author, "Pseudo-Ovidius" to scholars, has been thought to be [[Richard de Fournival]]; but this is not universally accepted. The attribution to Ovid was reinforced by an implausible claim that the poem had been found in his tomb. The poem presents him as a Christian convert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~aranar/ovid.htm "Ovid in the Middle Ages "]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of Ovid was questioned by the fifteenth-century humanist [[Angelo Decembrio]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Creating+canons+in+fifteenth-century+Ferrara:+Angelo+Decembrio%27s+De...-a0115270481 "Creating canons in fifteenth-century Ferrara: Angelo Decembrio's De politia litteraria, 1.10"].&lt;/ref&gt; in fact [[Petrarch]] had already denied that Ovid could be the poet.&lt;ref name = Binns203&gt;J. W. Binns, ''Ovid'' (1973), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a translation or paraphrase of the 1370s into French as ''La vieille'' ("The Old Woman") by Jean Le Fèvre.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Patterson, ''Chaucer and the Subject of History'' (1991), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edition by Hippolyte Cocheris (1861), ''La Vieille ou les dernières amours d'Ovide''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a Catalan prose translation ''Ovidi enamorat'' by [[Bernat Metge]] in the 1380s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escriptors.cat/autors/metgeb/obra.php?id_publi=14315&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was published in 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Brisson, Christoph Jamme, ''Introduction à la philosophie du mythe'' (1996), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Publius Ovidius Naso in the Nuremberg chronicle XCIIIv.jpg|thumb|Medieval view of Ovid: An early printed image in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]

==Non-poetic content==

It existed in numerous manuscripts, and is of independent interest because of its references to [[astronomy]] and [[gambling]]. The numerical game [[Rithmomachia]] is praised in it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jducoeur.org/game-hist/mebben.ryth.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an ancestor of [[backgammon]] is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt; [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/bckg/english/vetula.htm "De Vetula"- Pseudo-Ovidius 1250"] &lt;/ref&gt; Another pastime given extended treatment is [[fishing]].&lt;ref&gt; William Radcliffe, ''Fishing from the Earliest Times'' (1969), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in some manuscripts, the account of a [[dice]] game was accompanied by an enumeration of the combinations of three conventional cubic dice, and an explanation of the connection between the number of combinations and the expected frequency of a given total.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Jones, ''Exploring Probability in School: Challenges for Teaching and Learning'' (2005), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Roger Bacon took from Book III of ''De vetula'' a link between [[Aristotle]] and [[astronomy]]. He also was influenced by work of the astronomer [[Abumashar]] as represented in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett (editor), ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'' (1997), pp. 193-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Another who cited it out of scientific interest was [[Thomas Bradwardine]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Heyde, Eugene Seneta, ''Statisticians of the Centuries'' (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard de Bury]] cites it in his ''Philobiblon'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philobiblon.com/philobiblon.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juan Ruiz]] drew on it for his ''[[Libro de buen amor]]''.&lt;ref name = Binns203/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Euclid's ''Elements''}}
The '''''Elements''''' ({{lang-grc|Στοιχεῖα}} ''Stoicheia'') is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[treatise]] consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates, propositions ([[theorem]]s and [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructions]]), and [[mathematical proof]]s of the propositions. The books cover plane and solid [[Euclidean geometry]],  elementary [[number theory]], and [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lines. ''Elements'' is the oldest extant large-scale deductive treatment of [[mathematics]]. It has proven instrumental in the development of [[logic]] and modern [[science]], and its logical rigor was not surpassed until the 19th century.

Euclid's ''Elements'' has been referred to as the most successful&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece (2006) by Nigel Guy Wilson, page 278. Published by Routledge Taylor and Francis Group. Quote:"Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Roman and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Author of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=100|quote=As teachers at the school he called a band of leading scholars, among whom was the author of the most fabulously successful mathematics textbook ever written – the ''Elements'' (''Stoichia'') of Euclid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influential&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=119|quote=The ''Elements'' of Euclid not only was the earliest major Greek mathematical work to come down to us, but also the most influential textbook of all times.

[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|thumb|A fragment of Euclid's ''Elements'' on part of the [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]] ]]

===Basis in earlier work===
[[Image:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|An illumination from a manuscript based on [[Adelard of Bath]]'s translation of the ''Elements'', ''circa'' 1309–1316; Adelard's is the oldest surviving translation of the ''Elements'' into Latin, done in the 12th-century work and translated from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;]]
Scholars believe that the ''Elements'' is largely a compilation of propositions based on books by earlier Greek mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Awakening|last=van der Waerden|first=Bartel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proclus]] (412–485 AD), a Greek mathematician who lived around seven centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary on the ''Elements'': "Euclid, who put together the ''Elements'', collecting many of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]' theorems, perfecting many of [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors".

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–495 BC) was probably the source for most of books I and II, [[Hippocrates of Chios]] (c. 470–410 BC, not the better known [[Hippocrates|Hippocrates of Kos]]) for book III, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (c. 408–355 BC) for book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Rouse Ball, A Short Account of the History of Mathematics, 4th ed., 1908, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Elements'' may have been based on an earlier textbook by Hippocrates of Chios, who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission of the text===
In the fourth century AD, [[Theon of Alexandria]] produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until [[François Peyrard]]'s 1808 discovery at the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Heiberg]] manuscript, is from a [[Byzantine]] workshop around 900 and is the basis of modern editions.&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=2749 --&gt;http://historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2749 The Earliest Surviving Manuscript Closest to Euclid's Original Text (Circa 850)]; an [http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_math.html image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220042513/http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_math.html |date=2009-12-20 }} of one page&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]] is a tiny fragment of an even older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.

However, more recent biographical work has turned up no clear documentation that Adelard ever went to Muslim-ruled Spain, although he spent time in Norman-ruled Sicily and Crusader-ruled Antioch, both of which had Arabic-speaking populations.

Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570, [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] provided a widely respected "Mathematical Preface", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by [[Henry Billingsley]].

Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the [[Vatican Library]] and the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been made about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).

Ancient texts which refer to the ''Elements'' itself, and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written, are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|J. L. Heiberg]] and Sir [[Thomas Little Heath]] in their editions of the text.

Also of importance are the [[scholia]], or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or further study.

==Influence==
[[File:Euclid's Elements, 1482.jpg|thumb|A page with marginalia from the first printed edition of ''Elements'', printed by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in 1482]]

The ''Elements'' is still considered a masterpiece in the application of [[logic]] to [[mathematics]]. In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of [[science]]. Scientists [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Galileo Galilei]], and Sir [[Isaac Newton]] were all influenced by the ''Elements'', and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[Bertrand Russell]], have attempted to create their own foundational "Elements" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.

The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, "You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ketcham, ''The Life of Abraham Lincoln'', at Project Gutenberg, {{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6811 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330083804/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6811 |archivedate=2015-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] wrote in her sonnet "[[s:Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare|Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare]]", "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". [[Einstein]] recalled a copy of the ''Elements'' and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the "holy little geometry book".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley R.

The success of the ''Elements'' is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the ''Elements'', encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The ''Elements'' still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.

== Contents ==
* Book 1 contains 5 postulates (including the famous [[parallel postulate]]) and 5 common notions, and covers important topics of plane geometry such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], equality of angles and [[area]]s, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the construction of various geometric figures.
* Book 2 contains a number of lemmas concerning the equality of rectangles and squares, sometimes referred to as "[[Greek geometric algebra|geometric algebra]]", and concludes with a construction of the [[golden ratio]] and a way of constructing a square equal in area to any rectilineal plane figure.
* Book 3 deals with circles and their properties: finding the center, [[inscribe]]d angles, [[tangent]]s, the power of a point, [[Thales' theorem]].
* Book 4 constructs the [[incircle]] and [[circumcircle]] of a triangle, as well as [[regular polygon]]s with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.
* Book 5, on proportions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitudes]], gives the highly sophisticated theory of proportion probably developed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], and proves properties such as "alternation" (if ''a'' : ''b'' :: ''c'' : ''d'', then ''a'' : ''c'' :: ''b'' : ''d'').
* Book 6 applies proportions to plane geometry, especially the construction and recognition of [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] figures.
* Book 7 deals with elementary number theory: [[divisibility]], [[prime number]]s and their relation to composite numbers, [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]], finding the [[least common multiple]].
* Book 8 deals with the construction and existence of [[geometric progression|geometric sequences]] of integers.
* Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the [[infinitude of prime numbers]] and the construction of all even [[perfect number]]s.
* Book 10 proves the irrationality of the square roots of non-square integers (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;) and classifies the square roots of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lines into thirteen disjoint categories. Euclid here introduces the term "[[Irrational number|irrational]]", which has a different meaning than the modern concept of irrational numbers. He also gives a [[Euclid's formula|formula]] to produce [[Pythagorean triples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=June 1997 |last=Joyce |first=D.

* Book 11 generalizes the results of book 6 to solid figures: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes and similarity of [[parallelepiped]]s.
* Book 12 studies the volumes of [[cone (geometry)|cones]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]] in detail by using the [[method of exhaustion]], a precursor to [[integral|integration]], and shows, for example, that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing that the volume of a [[sphere]] is proportional to the cube of its radius (in modern language) by approximating its volume by a union of many pyramids.
* Book 13 constructs the five regular [[Platonic solid]]s inscribed in a sphere and compares the ratios of their edges to the radius of the sphere.

[[File:Euclid Vat ms no 190 I prop 47.jpg|thumb|Codex Vaticanus 190]]
Euclid's [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatic method|axiomatic approach]] and [[Euclidean geometry#Methods of proof|constructive methods]] were widely influential.

Many of Euclid's propositions were constructive, demonstrating the existence of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]]. His constructive approach appears even in his geometry's postulates, as the first and third postulates stating the existence of a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states that it is possible to 'construct' a line and circle. It also appears that, for him to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.{{Sfn|Hartshorne|2000|pp=18–20}}

As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed [[Mathematical proof|proof]] in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.

Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward [[Greek numerals|Alexandrian system of numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 58, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the 'enunciation', which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). Then comes the 'setting-out', which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the 'definition' or 'specification', which restates the enunciation in terms of the particular figure. Then the 'construction' or 'machinery' follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the 'proof' itself follows. Finally, the 'conclusion' connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1963), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the ''Elements''.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid's use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid's original proof of this proposition, is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfried Toussaint]], "A new look at Euclid's second proposition," ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 12–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Euclid's list of axioms in the ''Elements'' was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. Later editors have interpolated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematician and historian [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that "the fact that for two thousand years [the ''Elements''] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Ball (1960) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apocrypha ==
It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the [[apocryphal]] books XIV and XV of the ''Elements'' were sometimes included in the collection.&lt;ref name="Boyer Apocrypha"/&gt; The spurious Book XIV was probably written by [[Hypsicles]] on the basis of a treatise by [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]] inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\tfrac{10}{3(5-\sqrt{5})}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{6}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by [[Isidore of Miletus]]. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.&lt;ref name="Boyer Apocrypha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|pages=118–119|quote=In ancient times it was not uncommon to attribute to a celebrated author works that were not by him; thus, some versions of Euclid's ''Elements'' include a fourteenth and even a fifteenth book, both shown by later scholars to be apocryphal. The so-called Book XIV continues Euclid's comparison of the regular solids inscribed in a sphere, the chief results being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being that of the edge of the cube to the edge of the icosahedron, that is, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{10/[3(5-\sqrt{5})]}&lt;/math&gt;. It is thought that this book may have been composed by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and icosahedron. [...] The spurious Book XV, which is inferior, is thought to have been (at least in part) the work of Isidore of Miletus (fl. ca. A.D. 532), architect of the cathedral of Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) at Constantinople. This book also deals with the regular solids, counting the number of edges and solid angles in the solids, and finding the measures of the dihedral angles of faces meeting at an edge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5258">The following '''examples of [[generating function]]s''' are in the spirit of [[George Pólya]], who advocated learning mathematics by doing and re-capitulating as many examples and proofs as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The purpose of this article is to present common ways of creating generating functions.

== Worked example A: basics ==
New [[generating function]]s can be created by extending simpler generating functions. For [[Worked-example effect|example]], starting with

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ax&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;ax)=\frac{1}{1-ax} = 1+(ax)+(ax)^2+\cdots+(ax)^n+\cdots =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a^n x^n = G(a^n;x).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bivariate generating functions ===
One can define generating functions in several variables, for series with several indices. These are often called '''super generating functions,''' and for 2 variables are often called '''bivariate generating functions.'''

For instance, since &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; is the generating function for [[binomial coefficients]] for a fixed ''n,'' one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k'' and ''n.''
To do this, consider &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; as ''itself'' a series (in ''n''), and find the generating function in ''y'' that has these as coefficients. Since the generating function for &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;1/(1-ay)&lt;/math&gt;, the generating function for the binomial coefficients is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-(1+x)y}=1+(1+x)y+(1+x)^2y^2+\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
and the coefficient on &lt;math&gt;x^ky^n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficient.

== Worked example B: Fibonacci numbers ==

Consider the problem of finding a [[Closed-form expression|closed formula]] for the [[Fibonacci number]]s ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' ≥ 2. We form the ordinary generating function

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \sum_{n \ge 0} F_n x^n
&lt;/math&gt;

for this sequence. The generating function for the sequence (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''xf'' and that of (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f''. From the recurrence relation, we therefore see that the power series ''xf'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' agrees with ''f'' except for the first two coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcrcr}
f    &amp; = &amp; F_0x^0 &amp; + &amp; F_1x^1 &amp; + &amp; F_2x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
xf   &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; F_1x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-1}x^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
x^2f &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_0x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-2}x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
(x+x^2)f &amp; = &amp;    &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; (F_0+F_1)x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; (F_{i-1}+F_{i-2})x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
     &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_2x^2       &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; +&amp; \cdots\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking these into account, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;
f = xf + x^2 f + x .
&lt;/math&gt;

(This is the crucial step; recurrence relations can almost always be translated into equations for the generating functions.) Solving this equation for ''f'', we get

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{x} {1 - x - x^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator can be factored using the [[golden ratio]] φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 + {{radic|5}})/2 and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 &amp;minus; {{radic|5}})/2, and the technique of [[partial fraction decomposition]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left (\frac{1}{1-\varphi_1 x} - \frac{1} {1- \varphi_2 x} \right ) .
&lt;/math&gt;

These two formal power series are known explicitly because they are [[geometric series]]; comparing coefficients, we find the explicit formula

:&lt;math&gt;
F_n = \frac{1} {\sqrt{5}} (\varphi_1^n - \varphi_2^n).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Worked example C: Number of ways to make change==
The number of {{em|unordered}} ways ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(a_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n = \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^5)(1-x^{10})(1-x^{25})}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are two unordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, the other way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin.  See {{oeis|A001299}}.

On the other hand, the number of {{em|ordered}} ways ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(b_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n = \frac{1}{1-x-x^5-x^{10}-x^{25}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are three ordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, a second way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin, and a third way is one 5-cent coin and one 1-cent coin.  Compare to {{oeis|A114044}}, which differs from this example by also including coins with values 50 and 100.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24361">[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|286x286px|The [[Platonic solid]]s, seen here in an illustration from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596), are an early example of exceptional objects. The symmetries of three-dimensional space can be classified into two infinite families—the [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] and [[Dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetries of ''n''-sided polygons—and five exceptional types of symmetry, namely the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids.]]
Many branches of mathematics study objects of a given type and prove a [[classification theorem]]. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects and a finite number of exceptions that do not fit into any series. These are known as '''exceptional objects'''. Frequently these exceptional objects play a further and important role in the subject. Furthermore, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stillwell|first=John|date=1998|title=Exceptional Objects|jstor=2589218|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=105|issue=9|pages=850–858|doi=10.2307/2589218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1505.06742|first=Yang-Hui|last=He|first2=John|last2=McKay|author-link2=John McKay (mathematician)|title=Sporadic and Exceptional|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue33/features/baez/index|title=Ubiquitous octonions|last=Joyce|first=Helen|date=1 January 2005|website=Plus Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related phenomenon is [[exceptional isomorphism]], when two series are in general different, but agree for some small values.

== Regular polytopes ==
{{Main|Regular polytope}}
The prototypical examples of exceptional objects arise in the classification of [[regular polytope]]s. In two dimensions there is a series of [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. In every dimension above 2 we find analogues of the cube, tetrahedron and octahedron. In three dimensions we find two more regular polyhedra — the [[dodecahedron]] (12-hedron) and the [[icosahedron]] (20-hedron) — making five [[Platonic solids]]. In four dimensions we have a total of six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|regular polytopes]] including the [[120-cell]], the [[600-cell]] and the [[24-cell]]. There are no other regular polytopes; in higher dimensions the only regular polytopes are of the [[hypercube]], [[simplex]], [[orthoplex]] series.  In all dimensions combined, there are therefore three series and five exceptional polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/platonic.html|title=Platonic Solids in All Dimensions|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=12 November 2006|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern is similar if non-convex polytopes are included.  In two dimensions there is a [[regular star polygon]] for every [[rational number]] ''p''/''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.  In three dimensions there are four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]], and in four dimensions ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|Schläfli–Hess polychora]]; in higher dimensions there are no non-convex regular figures.

These can be generalized to [[tessellation]]s of other spaces, especially [[Uniform tiling|uniform tessellations]], notably tilings of Euclidean space ([[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]), which have exceptional objects, and tilings of hyperbolic space. There are various exceptional objects in dimension below 6, but in dimension 6 and above the only regular polyhedra/tilings/hyperbolic tilings are the simplex, hypercube, cross-polytope, and hypercube lattice.

=== Schwarz triangles ===

|}

Related to tilings and the regular polyhedra, there are exceptional [[Schwarz triangle]]s (triangles that tile the sphere, or more generally Euclidean plane or hyperbolic plane via their [[triangle group]] of reflections in their edges), particularly the [[Möbius triangle]]s. In the sphere there are 3 Möbius triangles (and 1 1-parameter family), corresponding to the 3 exceptional Platonic solid groups, while in the Euclidean plane there are 3 Möbius triangles, corresponding to the 3 special triangles: 60-60-60 ([[equilateral triangle|equilateral]]), [[45-45-90]] (isosceles right), and [[30-60-90]]. There are additional exceptional Schwarz triangles in the sphere and Euclidean plane. By contrast, in the hyperbolic plane there is a 3-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and none exceptional.

== Finite simple groups ==
{{Main|Sporadic group}}
[[File:SporadicGroups.svg|thumb|The relations between the sporadic groups, most being related to the monster.]]

The finite simple groups have been [[Classification of finite simple groups|classified]] into a number of series as well as 26 [[sporadic groups]]. Of these, 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the [[monster group]], referred to as the "Happy Family", while 6 are not, and are referred to as "[[Pariah group|pariahs]]".

Several of the sporadic groups are related to the [[Leech lattice]], most notably the Conway group Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, quotiented out by its center.

== Division algebras ==

There are only three finite-dimensional associative [[division algebras]] over the reals — the [[real numbers]], the [[complex numbers]] and the [[quaternions]]. The only non-associative division algebra is the algebra of [[octonions]]. The octonions are connected to a wide variety of exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional formally real [[Jordan algebra]] is the [[Albert algebra]] of 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions.

== Simple Lie groups ==

The [[simple Lie group]]s form a number of series ([[classical Lie group]]s) labelled A, B, C and D. In addition there are the exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the automorphism group of the octonions), [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. These last four groups can be viewed as the symmetry groups of projective planes over '''O''', '''C'''⊗'''O''', '''H'''⊗'''O''' and '''O'''⊗'''O''' respectively, where '''O''' is the octonions and the tensor products are over the reals.

The classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of [[root systems]] and thus the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional [[Dynkin diagram]]s.

== Supersymmetric algebras ==
There are a few exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. The classification of [[superalgebra]]s by [[Victor Kac|Kac]] and Tierry-Mieg indicates that the [[Lie superalgebra]]s '''G(3)''' in 31 dimensions and '''F(4)''' in 40 dimensions, and the Jordan superalgebras '''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''', are examples of exceptional objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V. G.|date=1977-01-01|title=Classification of simple z-graded lie superalgebras and simple jordan superalgebras|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00927877708822224|journal=Communications in Algebra|volume=5|issue=13|pages=1375–1400|doi=10.1080/00927877708822224|issn=0092-7872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0016126|title=Group Theoretical Methods in Physics|last=Thierry-Mieg|first=Jean|date=1984|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=94–98|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0016126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodular lattices ==

Up to isometry there is only one even [[unimodular lattice]] in 15 dimensions or less &amp;mdash; the [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]]. Up to dimension [[24 (number)|24]] there is only one even unimodular lattice without [[root system|roots]], the [[Leech lattice]]. Three of the sporadic simple groups were discovered by Conway while investigating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. For example, [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group itself modulo ±1. The groups [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], as well as a number of other sporadic groups, arise as stabilisers of various subsets of the Leech lattice.

== Codes ==

Some [[Error-correcting code|codes]] also stand out as exceptional objects, in particular the perfect binary Golay code which is closely related to the Leech lattice. The [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;, one of the sporadic simple groups, is the group of automorphisms of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]], and four more of the sporadic simple groups arise as various types of stabilizer subgroup of &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Block designs ==

An exceptional [[block design]] is the [[Steiner system]] S(5,8,24) whose automorphism group is the sporadic simple [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

The codewords of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]] have a length of 24 bits and have weights 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. This code can correct up to three errors. So every 24-bit word with weight 5 can be corrected to a codeword with weight 8. The bits of a 24-bit word can be thought of as specifying the possible subsets of a 24 element set. So the extended binary Golay code gives a unique 8 element subset for each 5 element subset. In fact, it defines S(5,8,24).

== Outer automorphisms ==
Certain families of groups generically have a certain [[outer automorphism group]], but in particular cases they have other, exceptional outer automorphisms.

Among families of finite simple groups, the only example is in the [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]]: for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3, n \neq 6&lt;/math&gt; the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; has one outer automorphism (corresponding to conjugation by an odd element of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has no outer automorphisms. However, for &lt;math&gt;n=6,&lt;/math&gt; there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;S_6&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2), and correspondingly, the outer automorphism group of &lt;math&gt;A_6&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; (the group of order 2) but rather &lt;math&gt;C_2 \times C_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Klein four-group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/08/a_wrinkle_in_the_mathematical.html|title=A Wrinkle in the Mathematical Universe|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=17 August 2015|website=[[nLab|The n-Category Café]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/alt/A6/|title=ATLAS: Alternating group A6, Linear group L2(9), Symplectic group S4(2)', Mathieu group M10'|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Atlas of Finite Groups|Atlas of Finite Group Representations]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMAg_Sj7hUC|title=The Finite Simple Groups|last=Wilson|first=Robert|date=2009-12-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781848009875|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one instead considers A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as the (isomorphic) [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,9), then the outer automorphism is not exceptional; thus the exceptionalness can be seen as due to the [[exceptional isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;A_6 \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,9).&lt;/math&gt; This exceptional outer automorphism is realized inside of the Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and similarly, M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; acts on a set of 12 elements in 2 different ways.

Among [[Lie groups]], the [[spin group]] Spin(8) has an exceptionally large outer automorphism group (namely &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;), which corresponds to the exceptional symmetries of the [[Dynkin diagram]] D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[triality]].''

The exceptional symmetry of the D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; diagram also gives rise to the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg groups]].

== Algebraic topology ==
{{Main|Kervaire invariant}}
The [[Kervaire invariant]] is an invariant of a (4''k''+2)-dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be [[Surgery theory|surgically]] converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. More specifically, the Kervaire invariant applies to a [[framed manifold]], that is, to a manifold equipped with an [[embedding]] into [[Euclidean space]] and a trivialization of the [[normal bundle]]. The Kervaire invariant problem is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/|title=Mathematicians Solve 45-Year-Old Kervaire Invariant Puzzle|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|date=20 July 2009|website=[[Simons Foundation]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1104.4523|first=Haynes|last=Miller|title=Kervaire Invariant One [after M. A. Hill, M. J. Hopkins, and D. C. Ravenel]|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five or six framed [[cobordism class]]es of manifolds having Kervaire invariant 1 are exceptional objects related to [[exotic sphere]]s. The first three cases are related to the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions respectively: a manifold of Kervaire invariant 1 can be constructed as the product of two spheres, with its exotic framing determined by the normed division algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranicki|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Commentary on "On the parallelizability of the spheres" by R. Bott and J. Milnor and "On the nonexistence of elements of Hopf invariant one" by J. F.

Due to similarities of dimensions, it is conjectured that the remaining cases (dimensions 30, 62 and 126) are related to the [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s, which are defined over algebras constructed from the octonions. Specifically, it has been conjectured that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower, but this remains unconfirmed.

== Symmetric quantum measurements ==

In [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]], there exist structures known as [[SIC-POVM]]s or SICs, which correspond to maximal sets of complex [[equiangular lines]]. Some of the known SICs&amp;mdash;those in vector spaces of 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as certain solutions in 8 dimensions&amp;mdash;are considered exceptional objects and called "sporadic SICs". They differ from the other known SICs in ways that involve their symmetry groups, the [[Galois theory]] of the numerical values of their vector components, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appleby|first=Marcus|last2=Flammia|first2=Steven|last3=McConnell|first3=Gary|last4=Yard|first4=Jon|date=2017-08-01|title=SICs and Algebraic Number Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1042–1059|arxiv=1701.05200|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1042A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporadic SICs in dimension 8 are related to the integral octonions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Blake C.|date=2017-08-01|title=Sporadic SICs and the Normed Division Algebras|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1060–1064|arxiv=1605.01426|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1060S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections ==
Numerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects. Most common are objects related to [[8 (number)|8]] and [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions, noting that 24&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3.  By contrast, the [[pariah group]]s stand apart, as the name suggests.

=== 8 and 24 dimensions ===
Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.
* The octonions are 8-dimensional.
* The [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]] can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).
* The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week106.html|title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics: Week106|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=23 July 1997|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; further, the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; algebra is related to the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).
* Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;24.
Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include the following.
* The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.
* Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster.
* The exceptional [[Jordan algebra]] has a representation in terms of 24&amp;times;24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.

These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves "exceptional". For example, in [[algebraic topology]], 8-fold real [[Bott periodicity]] can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [[modular forms]], the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [[Dedekind eta function]] and the [[modular discriminant]], which connection is deepened by [[Monstrous moonshine]], a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcherds|first=Richard E.|author-link=Richard Borcherds|date=1998|title=What is Moonshine?|url=http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/Fields/Borcherds.MAN.html|journal=Documenta Mathematica|volume=ICM 1|pages=607&amp;ndash;615|arxiv=math/9809110|via=|bibcode=1998math......9110B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[string theory]] and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena. For example, [[bosonic string theory]] requires a spacetime of dimension 26 which is directly related to the presence of 24 in the [[Dedekind eta function]]. Similarly, the possible dimensions of [[supergravity]] are related to the dimensions of the [[division algebras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=John C.|last2=Huerta|first2=John|date=October 2011|title=Division algebras and supersymmetry II|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.atmp/1349879112|journal=Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|language=EN|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1373–1410|arxiv=1003.3436|issn=1095-0761|via=|doi=10.4310/atmp.2011.v15.n5.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monstrous moonshine ===

Many of the exceptional objects in mathematics and physics have been found to be connected to each other. Developments such as the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures show how, for example, the [[Monster group]] is connected to [[string theory]]. The theory of [[modular forms]] shows how the algebra E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the Monster group. (In fact, well before the proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjecture, the [[J-invariant|elliptic ''j''-function]] was discovered to encode the representations of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V.G|title=An elucidation of "Infinite-Dimensional Algebras … and the very strange formula."

Below is a [[mind map]] showing how some of the exceptional objects in mathematics and mathematical physics are related.

[[File:Exceptionalmindmap2.png|600px]]

The connections can partly be explained by thinking of the algebras as a tower of lattice [[vertex operator algebra]]s. It just so happens that the vertex algebras at the bottom are so simple that they are isomorphic to familiar non-vertex algebras. Thus the connections can be seen simply as the consequence of some lattices being sub-lattices of others.

=== Supersymmetries ===
The [[Jordan superalgebra]]s are a parallel set of exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. These are the [[Lie superalgebra]]s which are related to Lorentzian lattices. This subject is less explored, and the connections between the objects are less well established. There are new conjectures parallel to the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures for these super-objects, involving different sporadic groups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Unexceptional objects ==

=== Pathologies ===
{{See also|Pathological (mathematics)}}
"Exceptional" object is reserved for objects that are unusual, meaning rare, the exception, not for ''unexpected'' or ''non-standard'' objects. These unexpected-but-typical (or common) phenomena are generally referred to as [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], such as [[nowhere differentiable function]]s, or "exotic", as in [[exotic sphere]]s — there are exotic spheres in arbitrarily high dimension (not only a finite set of exceptions), and in many dimensions most (differential structures on) spheres are exotic.

=== Extremal objects ===
Exceptional objects must be distinguished from ''extremal'' objects: those that fall in a family and are the most extreme example by some measure are of interest, but not unusual in the way exceptional objects are. For example, the [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' has the simplest [[continued fraction]] approximation, and accordingly is most difficult to [[Diophantine approximation|approximate by rationals]]; however, it is but one of infinitely many such quadratic numbers (continued fractions).

Similarly, the (2,3,7) [[Schwarz triangle]] is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and the associated [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] is of particular interest, being the universal [[Hurwitz group]], and thus being associated with the [[Hurwitz curve]]s, the maximally symmetric algebraic curves. However, it falls in a family of such triangles ((2,4,7), (2,3,8), (3,3,7), etc.), and while the smallest, is not exceptional or unlike the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2025">In applied mathematics, the '''fast sweeping method''' is a [[numerical method]] for solving [[boundary value problem]]s of the [[Eikonal equation]].

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla u(\mathbf{x})| = \frac 1 {f(\mathbf{x})} \text{ for } \mathbf{x} \in \Omega 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \text{ for } \mathbf{x} \in \partial \Omega  
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is an open set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is a function with positive values, &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is a well-behaved boundary of the open set and &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm.

The fast sweeping method is an iterative method which uses upwind difference for discretization and uses [[Gauss–Seidel method|Gauss–Seidel iterations]] with alternating sweeping ordering to solve the discretized Eikonal equation on a rectangular grid. The origins of this approach lie in [[control theory]].  Although fast sweeping methods have existed in control theory, it was first proposed for Eikonal equations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Hongkai|date=2005-01-01|title=A fast sweeping method for Eikonal equations|url=http://www.ams.org/mcom/2005-74-250/S0025-5718-04-01678-3/|journal=Mathematics of Computation|volume=74|issue=250|pages=603–627|doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-04-01678-3|issn=0025-5718}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hongkai Zhao, an applied mathematician at the [[University of California, Irvine]].

In 1870 Samuel Fielden, a wealthy mill owner from [[Todmorden]], donated £150 to Owens College (as the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] was then called) for the teaching of evening classes and a further £3000 for the development of natural sciences at the college. From 1877 this supported the '''Fielden Lecturer''', subsequently to become the '''Fielden Reader'''  with the appointment of L. J. Mordell in 1922 and then '''Fielden Professor'''  in 1923.  [[Alex Wilkie]] FRS  was appointed to the post in  2007.&lt;ref&gt;Job advert for Wilkie's dowary post at Manchester, downloaded July 2007, [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~mprest/furthpart.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Previous holders of the Fielden Chair (and lectureship) are:&lt;ref&gt;The list was furnished by the Archivist at the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''floor function''' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] that takes as input a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and gives as output the greatest [[integer]] less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{floor}(x) = \lfloor x\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, the '''ceiling function''' maps &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the least integer greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ceil}(x) = \lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, Ch. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{floor}(2.4) = \lfloor 2.4\rfloor = 2&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ceil}(2.4) = \lceil 2.4 \rceil = 3&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\lfloor 2\rfloor = \lceil 2 \rceil = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Notation==
The notion of '''integral part''' or '''integer part''' of ''x'' was first introduced by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] under the name '''entier''' (French for "integer") in 1798, when he needed the concept for his proof of the [[Legendre's formula]].

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] introduced the square bracket notation &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; in his third proof of [[quadratic reciprocity]] (1808).&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;10, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
This remained the standard&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cassels, Hardy &amp; Wright, and Ribenboim use Gauss's notation, Graham, Knuth &amp; Patashnik, and Crandall &amp; Pomerance use Iverson's.&lt;/ref&gt; in mathematics until [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] introduced the names "floor" and "ceiling" and the corresponding notations &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil &lt;/math&gt; in his 1962 book ''A Programming Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; Both notations are now used in mathematics;&lt;ref&gt;See the  Wolfram MathWorld article.&lt;/ref&gt; this article follows Iverson.

In mathematics, the floor function can also be written with boldface or double brackets &lt;math&gt;[\![x]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathwords.com/f/floor_function.htm Mathwords: Floor Function].&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling function has another notation with reversed boldface or double brackets &lt;math&gt;]\!]x[\![&lt;/math&gt; or just using normal reversed brackets &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathwords.com/c/ceiling_function.htm Mathwords: Ceiling Function]&lt;/ref&gt;

For negative values of ''x'', the terms '''integral part''' or '''integer part''' of ''x'' are sometimes instead taken to be the value of the ''ceiling'' function, i.e., the value of ''x'' rounded to an integer towards 0. The language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] uses &lt;code&gt;⌊x&lt;/code&gt;; other computer languages commonly use notations like &lt;code&gt;entier(x)&lt;/code&gt; ([[ALGOL]]), &lt;code&gt;INT(x)&lt;/code&gt; ([[BASIC]], [[MS Excel]]), or &lt;code&gt;floor(x)&lt;/code&gt;([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[R (programming language)|R]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ceiling function is usually denoted by &lt;code&gt;ceil(x)&lt;/code&gt; or less commonly &lt;code&gt;ceiling(x)&lt;/code&gt; in non-APL computer languages that have a notation for this function. The [[J (programming language)|J Programming Language]], a follow on to APL that is designed to use standard keyboard symbols, uses &lt;code&gt;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; for ceiling and &lt;code&gt;&lt;.&lt;/code&gt; for floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vocabulary|work=J Language|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[fractional part]] is the [[sawtooth function]], denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; for real ''x'' and defined by the formula&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\} = x -\lfloor x\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

For all ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt;0\le\{x\}&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Typesetting===
The floor and ceiling functions are usually typeset with left and right square brackets where the upper (for floor function) or lower (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are missing, and, e.g., in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting system these symbols can be specified with the {{mono|\lfloor, \rfloor, \lceil}} and {{mono|\rceil}} commands in math mode. HTML 4.0 uses the same names: {{mono|''&amp;amp;lfloor;'', ''&amp;amp;rfloor;'', ''&amp;amp;lceil;''}}, and {{mono|''&amp;amp;rceil;''}}. [[Unicode]] contains [[codepoint]]s for these symbols at &lt;code&gt;U+2308&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;U+230B&lt;/code&gt;: {{math|⌈''x''⌉}}, {{math|⌊''x''⌋}}.

==Definition and properties==
In the following formulas, ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers, ''k'', ''m'', and ''n'' are integers, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[integer]]s (positive, negative, and zero).

Floor and ceiling may be defined by the set equations

:&lt;math&gt; \lfloor x \rfloor=\max \{m\in\mathbb{Z}\mid m\le x\},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lceil x \rceil=\min \{n\in\mathbb{Z}\mid n\ge x\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is exactly one integer in a half-open interval of length one, for any real ''x'' there are unique integers ''m'' and ''n'' satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;m\le x \le n &lt;x+1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor = m&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil = n&lt;/math&gt;
&amp;nbsp;may also be taken as the definition of floor and ceiling.

===Equivalences===
These formulas can be used to simplify expressions involving floors and ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashink, Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lfloor x \rfloor = m &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;m &amp;\le x &lt; m+1,\\
\lceil x \rceil = n &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;n -1 &amp;&lt; x \le n,\\

\lfloor x \rfloor = m &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;x-1 &amp;&lt; m \le x,\\
\lceil x \rceil = n &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;x &amp;\le n &lt; x+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the language of [[order theory]], the floor function is a [[residuated mapping]], that is, part of a [[Galois connection]]: it is the upper adjoint of the function that embeds the integers into the reals.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x&lt;n &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;\lfloor x \rfloor &amp;&lt; n, \\
n&lt;x &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;n &amp;&lt; \lceil x \rceil, \\
x\le n &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;\lceil  x \rceil &amp;\le n, \\
n\le x &amp;\;\;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;n &amp;\le \lfloor x \rfloor.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas show how adding integers to the arguments affect the functions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lfloor x+n \rfloor &amp;= \lfloor x \rfloor+n,\\
\lceil x+n \rceil &amp;= \lceil x \rceil+n,\\
\{ x+n \} &amp;= \{ x \}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above are never true if ''n'' is not an integer; however, for every {{mvar|x, y}} the following inequalities hold:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor &amp;\leq \lfloor x + y \rfloor \leq \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor + 1,\\
\lceil x \rceil + \lceil y \rceil -1 &amp;\leq \lceil x + y \rceil \leq \lceil x \rceil + \lceil y \rceil.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Relations among the functions===
It is clear from the definitions that
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor \le \lceil x \rceil,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; with equality if and only if ''x'' is an integer, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = \begin{cases}
0&amp;\mbox{ if } x\in \mathbb{Z}\\
1&amp;\mbox{ if } x\not\in \mathbb{Z}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, for integers ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor n \rfloor = \lceil n \rceil = n.&lt;/math&gt;

Negating the argument switches floor and ceiling and changes the sign:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\lfloor x \rfloor +\lceil -x \rceil &amp;= 0 \\
-\lfloor x \rfloor &amp;= \lceil  -x \rceil \\
-\lceil  x \rceil  &amp;= \lfloor -x \rfloor
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and:
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor -x \rfloor = \begin{cases}
0&amp;\mbox{ if } x\in \mathbb{Z}\\
-1&amp;\mbox{ if } x\not\in \mathbb{Z},
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil + \lceil -x \rceil = \begin{cases}
0&amp;\mbox{ if } x\in \mathbb{Z}\\
1&amp;\mbox{ if } x\not\in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Negating the argument complements the fractional part:

:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \} +  \{ -x \} = \begin{cases}
0&amp;\mbox{ if } x\in \mathbb{Z}\\
1&amp;\mbox{ if } x\not\in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The floor, ceiling, and fractional part functions are [[Idempotence|idempotent]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Big\lfloor \lfloor x \rfloor \Big\rfloor &amp;= \lfloor x \rfloor, \\
\Big\lceil \lceil x \rceil \Big\rceil &amp;= \lceil x \rceil, \\
\Big\{ \{ x \} \Big\} &amp;= \{ x \}. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The result of nested floor or ceiling functions is the innermost function:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Big\lfloor \lceil x \rceil \Big\rfloor &amp;= \lceil x \rceil, \\
\Big\lceil \lfloor x \rfloor \Big\rceil &amp;= \lfloor x \rfloor. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Quotients===
If ''m'' and ''n'' are integers and ''n'' ≠  0,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le \left \{\frac{m}{n} \right\} \le 1-\frac{1}{|n|}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' is a positive integer&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\frac{x+m}{n}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{\lfloor x\rfloor +m}{n}\right\rfloor,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lceil\frac{x+m}{n}\right\rceil = \left\lceil\frac{\lceil x\rceil +m}{n}\right\rceil.
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''m'' is positive&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n=\left\lceil\frac{n}{m}\right\rceil + \left\lceil\frac{n-1}{m}\right\rceil +\dots+\left\lceil\frac{n-m+1}{m}\right\rceil,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{m}\right\rfloor +\dots+\left\lfloor\frac{n+m-1}{m}\right\rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''m'' = 2 these imply

:&lt;math&gt;n= \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right \rfloor + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right \rceil.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p. 85 and Ex. 3.15&lt;/ref&gt; for positive ''m'' (See [[Hermite's identity]])

:&lt;math&gt;\lceil mx \rceil =\left\lceil x\right\rceil  + \left\lceil x-\frac{1}{m}\right\rceil +\dots+\left\lceil x-\frac{m-1}{m}\right\rceil,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor mx \rfloor=\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor x+\frac{1}{m}\right\rfloor +\dots+\left\lfloor x+\frac{m-1}{m}\right\rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

The following can be used to convert floors to ceilings and vice versa (''m'' positive)&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, Ex. 3.12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil = \left\lfloor \frac{n+m-1}{m} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{m} \right\rfloor + 1, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor = \left\lceil \frac{n-m+1}{m} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{n + 1}{m} \right\rceil - 1, &lt;/math&gt;

If ''m''  and ''n'' are positive and [[coprime]], then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left\lfloor \frac{im}{n} \right\rfloor = \frac{1}{2}(m - 1)(n - 1).&lt;/math&gt;

The above formule can be generalized for all '' m '' and '' n '' strictly positive integers:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281593804_Combinatoire_de_N-Modules_Catalan J.E.blazek, Combinatoire de N-modules de Catalan], Master's thesis, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} \left\lfloor \frac{k m}{n} \right\rfloor = \frac{(m - 1)(n - 1)+\gcd(m,n)-1}2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the right-hand side is symmetrical in ''m'' and ''n'', this implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor \frac{m}{n} \right \rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2m}{n} \right \rfloor + \dots + \left\lfloor \frac{(n-1)m}{n} \right \rfloor =
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right \rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{m} \right \rfloor + \dots + \left\lfloor \frac{(m-1)n}{m} \right \rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''m'' and ''n'' are positive,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\left\lfloor \frac{x}{n} \right \rfloor +
\left\lfloor \frac{m+x}{n} \right \rfloor +
\left\lfloor \frac{2m+x}{n} \right \rfloor +
\dots +
\left\lfloor \frac{(n-1)m+x}{n} \right \rfloor\\=
&amp;\left\lfloor \frac{x}{m} \right \rfloor +
\left\lfloor \frac{n+x}{m} \right \rfloor +
\left\lfloor \frac{2n+x}{m} \right \rfloor +
\dots +
\left\lfloor \frac{(m-1)n+x}{m} \right \rfloor.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is sometimes called a [[#Quadratic reciprocity|reciprocity law]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested divisions===
For positive integer ''n'', and arbitrary real numbers ''m'',''x'':&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, p. 71, apply theorem 3.10 with x/m as input and the division by n as function&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \left\lfloor \frac{\lfloor x/m\rfloor}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{mn} \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \left\lceil \frac{\lceil x/m\rceil}{n} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{x}{mn} \right\rceil. &lt;/math&gt;

===Continuity and series expansions===
None of the functions discussed in this article are [[continuous function|continuous]], but all are [[piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]]: the functions &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{ x\}&lt;/math&gt; have discontinuities at the integers.

&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is [[semi-continuity|upper semi-continuous]] and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;math&gt;\{ x\}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; are lower semi-continuous.

Since none of the functions discussed in this article are continuous, none of them have a [[power series]] expansion. Since floor and ceiling are not periodic, they do not have uniformly convergent [[Fourier series]] expansions.  The fractional part function has Fourier series expansion&lt;ref&gt;Titchmarsh, p. 15, Eq. 2.1.7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\}= \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\frac{\sin(2 \pi k x)} {k}
&lt;/math&gt;
for {{mvar|x}} not an integer.

At points of discontinuity, a Fourier series converges to a value that is the average of its limits on the left and the right, unlike the floor, ceiling and fractional part functions: for ''y'' fixed and ''x'' a multiple of ''y'' the Fourier series given converges to ''y''/2, rather than to ''x''&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. At points of continuity the series converges to the true value.

Using the formula floor(x) = x &amp;minus; {x} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x\rfloor = x - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi}  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\sin(2 \pi k x)}{k}&lt;/math&gt; 
for {{mvar|x}} not an integer.

==Applications==

===Mod operator===

For an integer ''x'' and a positive integer ''y'', the '''[[modulo operation]]''', denoted by ''x'' mod ''y'', gives the value of the remainder when ''x'' is divided by ''y''.  This definition can be extended to real ''x'' and ''y'', ''y'' ≠  0, by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;x \bmod y = x-y\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y}\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

Then it follows from the definition of floor function that this extended operation satisfies many natural properties.  Notably, ''x'' mod ''y'' is always between 0 and ''y'', i.e.,

if ''y'' is positive,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le x \bmod y &lt;y,&lt;/math&gt;
and if ''y'' is negative,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \ge x \bmod y &gt;y.&lt;/math&gt;

===Quadratic reciprocity===
Gauss's third proof of [[quadratic reciprocity]], as modified by Eisenstein, has two basic steps.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, § 1.4, Ex. 1.32&amp;ndash;1.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, §§ 6.11&amp;ndash;6.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''p'' and ''q'' be distinct positive odd prime numbers, and let
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{p - 1}{2},&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{q - 1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

First, [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's lemma]] is used to show that the [[Legendre symbol]]s are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\left\lfloor\frac{q}{p}\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor\frac{2q}{p}\right\rfloor +\dots +\left\lfloor\frac{mq}{p}\right\rfloor }
&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = (-1)^{\left\lfloor\frac{p}{q}\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor\frac{2p}{q}\right\rfloor +\dots +\left\lfloor\frac{np}{q}\right\rfloor }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The second step is to use a geometric argument to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\frac{q}{p}\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor\frac{2q}{p}\right\rfloor +\dots +\left\lfloor\frac{mq}{p}\right\rfloor

+\left\lfloor\frac{p}{q}\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor\frac{2p}{q}\right\rfloor +\dots +\left\lfloor\frac{np}{q}\right\rfloor

= mn.
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these formulas gives quadratic reciprocity in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = (-1)^{mn}=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are formulas that use floor to express the quadratic character of small numbers mod odd primes ''p'':&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)  = (-1)^{\left\lfloor\frac{p+1}{4}\right\rfloor},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{3}{p}\right)  = (-1)^{\left\lfloor\frac{p+1}{6}\right\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Rounding===
For an arbitrary real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, [[rounding]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the nearest integer with [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie breaking]] towards positive infinity is given by &lt;math&gt;\text{rpi}(x)=\left\lfloor x+\tfrac{1}{2}\right\rfloor = \left\lceil \tfrac{\lfloor 2x \rfloor}2 \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;; rounding towards negative infinity is given as &lt;math&gt;\text{rni}(x)=\left\lceil x-\tfrac{1}{2}\right\rceil = \left\lfloor \tfrac{\lceil 2x \rceil}2 \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

If tie-breaking is away from 0, then the rounding function is &lt;math&gt;\text{ri}(x) = \sgn(x)\left\lfloor|x|+\tfrac{1}{2}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, and rounding towards even, as is usual in the [[nearest integer function]], can be expressed with the more cumbersome &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x\rceil=\left\lfloor x+\tfrac{1}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lceil\tfrac{2x-1}4\right\rceil-\left\lfloor\tfrac{2x-1}4\right\rfloor-1&lt;/math&gt;, which is the above expression for rounding towards positive infinity &lt;math&gt;\text{rpi}(x)&lt;/math&gt; minus an [[integer|integrality]] [[indicator function|indicator]] for &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2x-1}4&lt;/math&gt;.

===Truncation===
The [[truncation]] of a nonnegative number is given by &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;  The truncation of a nonpositive number is given by &lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.

The truncation of any real number can be given by: &lt;math&gt;\sgn(x) \lfloor |x| \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where sgn(x) is the [[sign function]].

===Number of digits===
The number of digits in [[base (exponentiation)|base]] ''b'' of a positive integer ''k'' is
::&lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_{b}{k} \rfloor + 1 = \lceil \log_{b}{(k+1)} \rceil .&lt;/math&gt;

===Factors of factorials===
Let ''n'' be a positive integer and ''p'' a positive prime number. The exponent of the highest power of ''p'' that divides ''n''! is given by the formula&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Th. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^2}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^3}\right\rfloor + \dots = \frac{n-\sum_{k}a_k}{p-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n = \sum_{k}a_kp^k&lt;/math&gt; is the way of writing ''n'' in base ''p''. Note that this is a finite sum, since the floors are zero when ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n''.

===Beatty sequence===
The [[Beatty sequence]] shows how every positive [[irrational number]] gives rise to a partition of the [[natural number]]s into two sequences via the floor function.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Knuth, &amp; Patashnik, pp. 77&amp;ndash;78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euler's constant (γ)===
There are formulas for [[Euler–Mascheroni constant|Euler's constant]] γ = 0.57721 56649 ... that involve the floor and ceiling, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;These formulas are from the Wikipedia article [[Euler–Mascheroni constant|Euler's constant]], which has many more.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma =\int_1^\infty\left({1\over\lfloor x\rfloor}-{1\over x}\right)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma =      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \left ( \left \lceil \frac{n}{k} \right \rceil - \frac{n}{k} \right ),
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
 \gamma = \sum_{k=2}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{ \left \lfloor \log_2 k \right \rfloor}{k}
  = \tfrac12-\tfrac13
  + 2\left(\tfrac14 - \tfrac15 + \tfrac16 - \tfrac17\right)
  + 3\left(\tfrac18 - \dots - \tfrac1{15}\right) + \dots
&lt;/math&gt;

===Riemann function (ζ)===
The fractional part  function also shows up in integral representations of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. It is straightforward to prove (using integration by parts)&lt;ref&gt;Titchmarsh, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; that if &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is any function with a continuous derivative in the closed interval [''a'', ''b''],

:&lt;math&gt;{ \sum_{a&lt;n\le b}\phi(n) =
\int_a^b\phi(x) dx +
\int_a^b\left(\{x\}-\tfrac12\right)\phi'(x) dx +
\left(\{a\}-\tfrac12\right)\phi(a) -
\left(\{b\}-\tfrac12\right)\phi(b). }
&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;\phi(n)={n}^{-s}&lt;/math&gt; for [[real part]] of ''s'' greater than 1 and letting ''a'' and ''b'' be integers, and letting ''b'' approach infinity gives

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = s\int_1^\infty\frac{\frac12-\{x\}}{x^{s+1}}\,dx + \frac{1}{s-1} + \frac12.
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is valid for all ''s'' with real part greater than &amp;minus;1, (except ''s'' = 1, where there is a pole) and combined with the Fourier expansion for {''x''} can be used to extend the zeta function to the entire complex plane and to prove its functional equation.&lt;ref&gt;Titchmarsh, pp.14&amp;ndash;15&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''s'' = σ + ''i t'' in the critical strip (i.e. 0 &lt; σ &lt; 1),

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)=s\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\sigma\omega}(\lfloor e^\omega\rfloor - e^\omega)e^{-it\omega}\,d\omega.
&lt;/math&gt;

In 1947 [[Balthasar van der Pol|van der Pol]] used this representation to construct an analogue computer for finding roots of the zeta function.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulas for prime numbers===
The floor function appears in several formulas characterizing prime numbers.  One example is that a positive integer ''n'' is a prime [[if and only if]]&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, Ex. 1.3, p. 46. The infinite upper limit of the sum can be replaced with ''n''. An equivalent condition is &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1 is prime if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor{\sqrt{n}}\rfloor}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{m}\right\rfloor\right) = 1&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{m}\right\rfloor\right) = 2.
&lt;/math&gt;

One may also give formulas for producing the prime numbers.  For example, let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; prime, and for any integer ''r'' &gt; 1, define the real number ''&amp;alpha;'' by the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sum_{m=1}^\infty p_m r^{-m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 22.3&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_n = \left\lfloor r^{n^2}\alpha \right\rfloor - r^{2n-1}\left\lfloor r^{(n-1)^2}\alpha\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar result is that there is a number ''θ'' = 1.3064... ([[Mills' constant]]) with the property that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor \theta^3 \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \theta^9 \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \theta^{27} \right\rfloor, \dots&lt;/math&gt;

are all prime.&lt;ref name="Ribenboim, p. 186"&gt;Ribenboim, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a number ''ω'' = 1.9287800... with the property that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor 2^\omega\right\rfloor, \left\lfloor 2^{2^\omega} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor 2^{2^{2^\omega}} \right\rfloor, \dots&lt;/math&gt;

are all prime.&lt;ref name="Ribenboim, p. 186"/&gt;

Let π(''x'') be the number of primes less than or equal to ''x''. It is a straightforward deduction from [[Wilson's theorem]] that&lt;ref&gt;Ribenboim, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(n) = \sum_{j=2}^n\left\lfloor\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} - \left\lfloor\frac{(j-1)!}{j}\right\rfloor\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, if ''n'' ≥ 2,&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, Ex. 1.4, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) = \sum_{j=2}^n \left\lfloor \frac{1}{\sum_{k=2}^j\left\lfloor\left\lfloor\frac{j}{k}\right\rfloor\frac{k}{j}\right\rfloor}\right\rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

None of the formulas in this section are of any practical use.&lt;ref&gt;Ribenboim, p.180 says that "Despite the nil practical value of the formulas ... [they] may have some relevance to logicians who wish to understand clearly how various parts of arithmetic may be deduced from different axiomatzations ... "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, pp.344—345 "Any one of these formulas (or any similar one) would attain a different status if the exact value of the number α ... could be expressed independently of the primes. There seems no likelihood of this, but it  cannot be ruled out as entirely impossible."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solved problems===
[[Ramanujan]] submitted these problems to the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanujan, Question 723, ''Papers'' p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''n'' is a positive integer, prove that

(i) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\tfrac{n}{3}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\tfrac{n+2}{6}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\tfrac{n+4}{6}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\tfrac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\tfrac{n+3}{6}\right\rfloor,
&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\tfrac12 + \sqrt{n+\tfrac12}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\tfrac12 + \sqrt{n+\tfrac14}\right\rfloor,
&lt;/math&gt;

(iii) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor\sqrt{n}+ \sqrt{n+1}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \sqrt{4n+2}\right\rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Unsolved problem===
The study of [[Waring's problem]] has led to an unsolved problem:

Are there any positive integers ''k'' ≥ 6  such that&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3^k-2^k\left\lfloor \left(\tfrac32\right)^k \right\rfloor  &gt; 2^k-\left\lfloor \left(\tfrac32\right)^k \right\rfloor -2&lt;/math&gt; ?

[[Kurt Mahler|Mahler]]&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, K. ''On the fractional parts of the powers of a rational number II'', 1957, Mathematika, '''4''', pages 122-124&lt;/ref&gt; has proved there can only be a finite number of such ''k''; none are known.

==Computer implementations==
[[File:Int function.svg|thumb|right|Int function from floating-point conversion in [[C (programming language)|C]]]]
In most programming languages, the simplest method to convert a floating point number to an integer does not do floor or ceiling, but [[#Truncation|truncation]]. This is historical as the first machines used [[ones' complement]] and truncation was simpler to implement (floor is simpler in [[two's complement]]). [[FORTRAN]] was defined to require this behavior and thus almost all processors implement conversion this way. Some consider this to be an unfortunate historical design decision that has led to bugs handling negative offsets and graphics on the negative side of the origin.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Spreadsheet software===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}

Most [[spreadsheet]] programs support some form of a &lt;code&gt;ceiling&lt;/code&gt; function.  Although the details differ between programs, most implementations support a second parameter—a multiple of which the given number is to be rounded to.  For example, &lt;code&gt;ceiling(2, 3)&lt;/code&gt; rounds 2 up to the nearest multiple of 3, giving 3.  The definition of what "round up" means, however, differs from program to program.

Until Excel 2010, [[Microsoft Excel]]'s &lt;code&gt;ceiling&lt;/code&gt; function was incorrect for negative arguments; ceiling(-4.5) was -5. This has followed through to the [[Office Open XML]] file format. Excel 2010 now follows the standard definition.&lt;ref&gt;But the online help provided in 2010 does not reflect this behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, its &lt;code&gt;roundup&lt;/code&gt; function continues to round away from zero.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/ROUNDUP-function-f8bc9b23-e795-47db-8703-db171d0c42a7 Microsoft Office Support: ROUNDUP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OpenDocument]] file format, as used by [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Libreoffice]] and others, follows the mathematical definition of ceiling for its &lt;code&gt;ceiling&lt;/code&gt; function, with an optional parameter for Excel compatibility. For example, &lt;code&gt;CEILING(-4.5)&lt;/code&gt; returns −4.

New possibilities opened up by the concept of [[four-dimensional space]] (and difficulties involved in trying to visualize it) helped inspire many modern artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Early [[Cubists]], [[Surrealists]], [[Futurists]], and [[Abstract art|abstract]] artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fourth-dimension-and-non-euclidean-geometry-modern-art |title=Overview of ''The Fourth Dimension And Non-Euclidean Geometry In Modern Art, Revised Edition'' |first1=Linda Dalrymple|last1=Henderson |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1912-1913, L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird) oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris..jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1912-1913, ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird)]]'', oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]

French [[mathematician]] [[Maurice Princet]] was known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Décimo |first=Marc |title=Maurice Princet, Le Mathématicien du Cubisme |year=2007 |publisher=Éditions L'Echoppe |location=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-84068-191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associate of the [[School of Paris]], a group of [[Avant-garde|avant-gardists]] including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]] during the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: space, time, and beauty that causes havoc |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2001 |type=Print|page=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet introduced Picasso to [[Esprit Jouffret]]'s ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'' in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |page=28 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] [[fauvism]] displayed in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', to a more considered analysis of space and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought  |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print|pages=28–30 |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cubist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] wrote an article entitled "In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View", for [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s July 1910 issue of ''[[Camera Work]]''. In the piece, Weber states, "In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Weber |authorlink=Max Weber |year=1910 |title=In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View |journal= [[Camera Work]]|volume= 31|issue= July 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on the School of Paris was that of [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Albert Gleizes]], both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', which says that:&lt;blockquote&gt; "If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of [[Bernhard Riemann#Euclidean geometry versus Riemannian geometry|Riemann's theorems]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Du "Cubisme" (Edition Figuière)| first1=Albert| first2= Jean| last1=Gleizes |last2=Metzinger |authorlink1=Albert Gleizes |authorlink2=Jean Metzinger |location=Paris|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American modernist painter and photographer [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] wrote in 1910 two letters to [[Walter Pach]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Walter Pach in Paris, 29 December 1910, Pach Papers, Reel: 4216, fr. 856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Pach in Paris, 29
December 1910, fr. 857&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which were published in a review of the [[Armory Show|1913 Armory Show]] for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morton Livingston Schamberg, "Post-Impression Exhibit Awaited", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 January 1913, col. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed "harmonic use of forms" distinguishing between the "representation or rendering of space and the designing in space":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oja|first1=Carol J.|title=Making Music Modern: New York in the 1920s|page=84|year=2000, February 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA}}{{ISBN|9780195162578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/33294 Jill Anderson Kyle, ''Cézanne and American Painting 1900 to 1920''], The University of Texas at Austin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with [[simultaneity]], complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensionist manifesto==
In 1936 in Paris, [[Charles Sirato|Charles Tamkó Sirató]] published his ''Manifeste Dimensioniste'',&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artpool.hu/TamkoSirato/manifest.html |title=Dimensionist Manifesto |first1=Charles Tamkó |last1=Sirató |location=Paris |year=1936 |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described how {{quote|the Dimensionist tendency has led to: 
# Literature leaving the line and entering the plane. 
# Painting leaving the plane and entering space.
# Sculpture stepping out of closed, immobile forms.
# …The artistic conquest of four-dimensional space, which to date has been completely art-free.}}

The manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. [[Hans Arp]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Joan Miró]], [[David Kakabadze]], [[Alexander Calder]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''French mathematical seminars''' have been an important type of institution combining research and exposition, active since the beginning of the twentieth century. 

From 1909 to 1937, the [[Séminaire Hadamard]] has gathered many participants (f. i. [[André Weil]]) around the presentation of international research papers and work in progress. The [[Séminaire Julia]] focussed on yearly themes and impulsed the Bourbaki movement. The [[Séminaire Nicolas Bourbaki]] is the most famous, but is atypical in a number of ways: it attempts to cover, if selectively, the whole of [[pure mathematics]], and its talks are now, by convention, reports and surveys on research by someone not directly involved. More standard is a working group organised around a specialist area, with research talks given and written up 'from the horse's mouth'.

Historically speaking, the [[Séminaire Cartan]] of the late 1940s and early 1950s, around [[Henri Cartan]],  was one of the most influential. Publication in those days was by means of the duplicated ''exemplaire'' (limited distribution and not peer-reviewed). The seminar model was tested, almost to destruction, by the SGA series of [[Alexander Grothendieck]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8874">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|Visual representation of the Pythagorean theorem. Under the proposal the shape seen here would be drawn at vast size on the Siberian tundra using pine trees and fields of wheat.]]
'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is credited with an 1820 proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J.

Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In [[logic]] and related fields such as [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], '''if and only if''' (shortened '''iff''') is a [[biconditional]] [[logical connective]] between statements.

In that it is [[biconditional]] (a statement of '''material equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=I. M. |last2=Cohen |first2=C. |last3=Flage |first3=D. E. |year=2006 |title=Essentials of Logic |edition=Second |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |page=197 |isbn=978-0-13-238034-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the connective can be likened to the standard [[material conditional]] ("only if", equal to "if ... then") combined with its reverse ("if"); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i.e. either both statements are true, or both are false). It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English "if and only if", with its pre-existing meaning.

In writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to P "if and only if" Q include: ''Q is [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient]] for P'', ''P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q'' (compare [[material conditional|material implication]]), ''P precisely if Q'', ''P precisely (or exactly) when Q'', ''P exactly in case Q'', and ''P just in case Q''.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Iff." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Iff.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors regard "iff" as unsuitable in formal writing;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{citation |title=Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics |series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] |first1=Ulrich |last1=Daepp |first2=Pamela |last2=Gorkin|author2-link=Pamela Gorkin |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=9781441994790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QKcaXrVZb0C&amp;pg=PA52 |page=52 |quote=While it can be a real time-saver, we don't recommend it in formal writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others use it freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Engineering Writing by Design: Creating Formal Documents of Lasting Value |first1=Edward J. |last1=Rothwell |first2=Michael J. |last2=Cloud |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781482234312 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muXMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |quote=It is common in mathematical writing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[formula (mathematical logic)|logical formulae]], logical symbols are used instead of these phrases; see the discussion of notation.

It is equivalent to that produced by the [[XNOR gate]], and opposite to that produced by the [[XOR gate]].

==Usage==

===Notation===
The corresponding logical symbols are "↔", "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;", and "[[Triple bar|≡]]", and sometimes "iff". These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of [[mathematical logic]] (particularly those on [[first-order logic]], rather than [[propositional logic]]) make a distinction between these, in which the first, ↔, is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while ⇔ is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in [[metalogic]]). In [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]]'s notation, it is the prefix symbol 'E'.

Another term for this [[logical connective]] is [[exclusive nor]].

In [[TeX]] "if and only if" is shown as a long double arrow: &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; via command \iff.

===Proofs===
In most [[logical system]]s, one [[Proof theory|proves]] a statement of the form "P iff Q" by proving "if P, then Q" and "if Q, then P".  Proving this pair of statements sometimes leads to a more natural proof since there are not obvious conditions in which one would infer a biconditional directly. An alternative is to prove the [[disjunction]] "(P and Q) or (not-P and not-Q)", which itself can be inferred directly from either of its disjuncts—that is, because "iff" is [[truth-function]]al, "P iff Q" follows if P and Q have both been shown true, or both false.

===Origin of iff and pronunciation===
Usage of the abbreviation "iff" first appeared in print in [[John L. Kelley]]'s 1955 book ''General Topology''.&lt;ref&gt;''General Topology,'' reissue {{ISBN|978-0-387-90125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its invention is often credited to [[Paul Halmos]], who wrote "I invented 'iff,' for  'if and only if'—but I could never believe I was really its first inventor."&lt;ref name="Higham1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas J. Higham |title=Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQd2fJA7Y4C&amp;pg=PA24 |year=1998 |publisher=SIAM |isbn=978-0-89871-420-3 |page=24 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is somewhat unclear how "iff" was meant to be pronounced. In current practice, the single 'word' "iff" is almost always read as the four words "if and only if". However, in the preface of ''General Topology'', Kelley suggests that it should be read differently: "In some cases where mathematical content requires 'if and only if' and [[euphony]] demands something less I use Halmos' 'iff'". The authors of one discrete mathematics textbook suggest:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics |last=Maurer |first=Stephen B. |last2=Ralston |first2=Anthony |publisher=CRC Press |year=2005 |isbn=1568811667 |edition=3rd |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Should you need to pronounce iff, really [[Consonant gemination|hang on to the 'ff']] so that people hear the difference from 'if'", implying that "iff" could be pronounced as {{IPA|[ɪfː]}}.

=== Usage in definitions ===
Technically, definitions are always "if and only if" statements; many texts such as Kelley's ''General Topology'' follow the strict demands of logic, and use "if and only if" or ''iff'' in definitions of new terms (for instance, from ''General Topology'', p. 25: "A set is '''countable''' iff it is finite or countably infinite" [boldface in original]). However, this usage of "if and only if" is not universal; often, mathematical definitions follow the special convention that "if" is interpreted to mean "if and only if" (for example, one might say, "A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=71 |first=Steven G. |last=Krantz |title=A Primer of Mathematical Writing |year=1996 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-0-8218-0635-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from "if" and "only if"==

# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple."''' (equivalent to '''"&lt;u&gt;Only if&lt;/u&gt; Madison will eat the fruit, it is an apple;"''' or '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''←'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This states that Madison will eat fruits that are apples. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison might also eat bananas or other types of fruit. All that is known for certain is that she will eat any and all apples that she happens upon. That the fruit is an apple is a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.
# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;only if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple."''' (equivalent to '''"&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt; Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple"''' or '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''→'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This states that the only fruit Madison will eat is an apple. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison will refuse an apple if it is made available, in contrast with (1), which requires Madison to eat any available apple. In this case, that a given fruit is an apple is a ''necessary'' condition for Madison to be eating it. It is not a sufficient condition since Madison might not eat all the apples she is given.
# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;if and only if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple"''' (equivalent to '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''↔'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This statement makes it clear that Madison will eat all and only those fruits that are apples. She will not leave any apple uneaten, and she will not eat any other type of fruit. That a given fruit is an apple is both a ''necessary'' and a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.

Sufficiency is the converse of necessity. That is to say, given ''P''→''Q'' (i.e. if ''P'' then ''Q''), ''P'' would be a sufficient condition for ''Q'', and ''Q'' would be a necessary condition for ''P''. Also, given ''P''→''Q'', it is true that ''¬Q''→''¬P'' (where ¬ is the negation operator, i.e. "not"). This means that the relationship between ''P'' and ''Q'', established by ''P''→''Q'', can be expressed in the following, all equivalent, ways:
:''P'' is sufficient for ''Q''
:''Q'' is necessary for ''P''
:''¬Q'' is sufficient for ''¬P''
:''¬P'' is necessary for ''¬Q''
As an example, take (1), above, which states ''P''→''Q'', where ''P'' is "the fruit in question is an apple" and ''Q'' is "Madison will eat the fruit in question". The following are four equivalent ways of expressing this very relationship:
:If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it.
:Only if Madison will eat the fruit in question, is it an apple.
:If Madison will not eat the fruit in question, then it is not an apple.
:Only if the fruit in question is not an apple, will Madison not eat it.
So we see that (2), above, can be restated in the form of ''if...then'' as "If Madison will eat the fruit in question, then it is an apple"; taking this in conjunction with (1), we find that (3) can be stated as "If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it; ''and'' if Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple".

==In terms of Euler diagrams==
&lt;gallery widths="270"&gt;
File:Example of A is a proper subset of B.svg|A is a proper subset of B. A number is in A only if it is in B; a number is in B if it is in A.
File:Example of C is no proper subset of B.svg|C is a subset but not a proper subset of B. A number is in B if and only if it is in C, and a number is in C if and only if it is in B.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Euler diagram]]s show logical relationships among events, properties, and so forth. "P only if Q", "if P then Q", and  "P→Q" all mean that P is a [[subset]], either proper or improper, of Q. "P if Q", "if Q then P", and Q→P all mean that Q is a proper or improper subset of P. "P if and only if Q" and "Q if and only if P" both mean that the sets P and Q are identical to each other.

==More general usage==
Iff is used outside the field of logic. Wherever logic is applied, especially in [[mathematics|mathematical]] discussions, it has the same meaning as above: it is an abbreviation for ''if and only if'', indicating that one statement is both [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for the other. This is an example of [[mathematical jargon]]. (However, as noted above, ''if'', rather than ''iff'', is more often used in statements of definition.)

The elements of ''X'' are ''all and only'' the elements of ''Y'' is used to mean: "for any ''z'' in the [[domain of discourse]], ''z'' is in ''X'' if and only if ''z'' is in ''Y''."

[[File:Infinite.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[infinity symbol]]]]
'''Infinity''' (symbol: {{math|∞|size=150%}}) is a concept describing something without any bound or larger than any [[natural number]]. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example [[Zeno of Elea]], who proposed many [[paradox]]es involving infinity, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his [[method of exhaustion]]. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in [[calculus]] and [[set theory]], and the idea is also used in [[physics]] and the other sciences.

In mathematics, "infinity" is often treated as a [[number]] (i.e., it counts or measures things: "an infinite number of terms") but it is not the same sort of number as either a [[natural number|natural]] or a [[real number|real]] number.

[[Georg Cantor]] formalized many ideas related to infinity and [[infinite set]]s during the late&amp;nbsp;19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called [[cardinality|cardinalities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the set of [[integer]]s is [[Countable set|countably infinite]], while the infinite set of real numbers is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 113 –117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Infinity (philosophy)}}
Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The [[Maurya Empire|ancient Indians]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.

===Early Greek===
The earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from [[Anaximander]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]]. He used the word [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] which means infinite or limitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from [[Zeno of Elea]] (born {{circa|490 BCE}}), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] School founded by [[Parmenides]]. [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/ |title=Zeno's Paradoxes | author= |date=October 15, 2010 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/|title=Zeno of Elea| author= |date=January 5, 2017 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]],&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes" /&gt; described by [[Bertrand Russell]] as "immeasurably subtle and profound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the [[actual infinity]]; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, [[Euclid]] prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid. [[Euclid's Elements]], Book&amp;nbsp;IX, Proposition&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent readings of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] have found that [[Archimedes]] had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to ''Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls'', Archimedes has been found to be "the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wassim M. Haddad|author2=VijaySekhar Chellaboina|title=Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control: A Lyapunov-Based Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|date=February 17, 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13329-8|page=xxv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404054122/https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|archivedate=April 4, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Indian===
The [[Indian mathematics|Jain mathematical]] text [[Sūryaprajapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: [[enumerable]], innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Stewart|title=Infinity: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875523-4|page=117|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403200429/https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|archivedate=April 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

In this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between [[Asaṃkhyeya|{{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}}]] ("countless, innumerable") and ''[[Ananta (infinite)|ananta]]'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutta|first1=Bidyarthi|title=Ranganathan's elucidation of subject in the light of 'Infinity (∞)'|journal=Annals of Library and Information Studies|date=December 2015|volume=62 |pages=255–264 |url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/ALIS/article/view/11415/0|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 [[John Wallis]] first used the notation &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for such a number in his ''De sectionibus conicis'' and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into [[infinitesimal]] strips of width on the order of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 421, Vol. II, pg. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in ''Arithmetica infinitorum'' (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending "&amp;c." For example, "1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 435, Vol. II, pg. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 [[Isaac Newton]] wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940 |first1=Ivor |last1=Grattan-Guinness |publisher=Elsevier |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-08-045744-4 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085825/https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA62 Extract of page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinity symbol===
{{main|Infinity symbol}}
The infinity symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the [[lemniscate]]) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|221E|infinity|html=}} and in [[LaTeX]] as &lt;code&gt;\infty&lt;/code&gt;.

It was introduced in 1655 by [[John Wallis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Calculus===

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], one of the co-inventors of [[infinitesimal calculus]], speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the [[Law of Continuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=continuity |title=Continuity and Infinitesimals |last=Bell |first=John Lane |author-link=John Lane Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Real analysis====

In [[real analysis]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", is used to denote an unbounded [[limit of a function|limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1955|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows without bound, and &lt;math&gt;x \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt; means that &amp;nbsp;''x'' decreases without bound. If ''f''(''t'') ≥ 0 for every&amp;nbsp;''t'', then&lt;ref&gt;These uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, {{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|pp=468–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f''(''t'') does not bound a finite area from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the area under ''f''(''t'') is infinite.
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the total area under ''f''(''t'') is finite, and equals &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

Infinity is also used to describe [[infinite series]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[convergent series|converges]] to some real value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[divergent series|diverges]] in the specific sense that the partial sums grow without bound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Infinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the [[topological space]] of the real numbers, producing the two-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the [[extended real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We can also treat &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the [[real projective line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gemignani|1990|loc=p. 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Projective geometry]] also refers to a [[line at infinity]] in plane geometry, a [[plane at infinity]] in three-dimensional space, and a [[hyperplane at infinity]] for general [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]], each consisting of [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Albrecht|last1=Beutelspacher|first2=Ute|last2=Rosenbaum|title=Projective Geometry / from foundations to applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48364-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex analysis====
[[File:Riemann sphere1.svg|thumb|right|250px|By [[stereographic projection]], the complex plane can be "wrapped" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the [[Riemann sphere]].]]

In [[complex analysis]] the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", denotes an unsigned infinite [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]. &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the magnitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows beyond any assigned value. A [[point at infinity|point labeled &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;]] can be added to the complex plane as a [[topological space]] giving the one-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional [[complex manifold]], or [[Riemann surface]], called the extended complex plane or the [[Riemann sphere]]. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely &lt;math&gt;z/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; for any nonzero complex number&amp;nbsp;''z''. In this context it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Nonstandard analysis===
[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&amp;nbsp;H is an infinite number, then H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2H and H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.

===Set theory===
{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}

[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset]]

A different form of "infinity" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory. [[Georg Cantor]] developed a system of [[transfinite number]]s, in which the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (&lt;span style="font-family:'Cambria Math';"&gt;&lt;big&gt;ℵ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;(\aleph_0)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''uncountable''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the [[hyperreal number]]s, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Cardinality of the continuum====
{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c&lt;/math&gt; is greater than that of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; {\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dauben

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \aleph_1 = \beth_1 &lt;/math&gt;  (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]).  This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], even assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963|p=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal arithmetic]] can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any [[finite-dimensional]] space.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Peanocurve.svg|thumb|The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a [[space-filling curve]], showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square.]]
The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] function, which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−π/2, π/2) and&amp;nbsp;'''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]). The second result was proved by Cantor in&amp;nbsp;1878, but only became intuitively apparent in&amp;nbsp;1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [[cube]], or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|1994|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry and topology===
{{Main|Dimension (vector space)}}

Infinite-[[dimension]]al spaces are widely used in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], particularly as [[classifying space]]s, such as [[Eilenberg−MacLane space]]s. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] [[K(Z,2)]] and the infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]] K(Z/2Z,1).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Fractals===
The structure of a [[fractal]] object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Mathematics without infinity===
[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] called [[finitism]], an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [[Mathematical constructivism|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=1197–1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

In [[physics]], approximations of [[real number]]s are used for [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] measurements and [[natural number]]s are used for [[countable|discrete]] measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no [[observable|measurable quantity]] could have an infinite value, {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} for instance by taking an infinite value in an [[extended real number line|extended real number]] system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [[plane wave]] exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf Doric Lenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011604/http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} – Application Note – Axicons – 2. Intensity Distribution. Retrieved 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical applications of physical infinity===
The practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations {{Disputed inline|date=November 2015}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use [[infinite series]], unbounded [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In [[quantum field theory]] infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called [[renormalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in the description of [[black holes]]. Some solutions of the equations of the [[general theory of relativity]] allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a [[mathematical singularity]], or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[Coulomb's law]] of electrostatics. At&amp;nbsp;r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Cosmology===
The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{isbn|9780470613528}}. p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] proposed an unbounded universe in ''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds'': "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alien Life Imagined: Communicating the Science and Culture of Astrobiology |edition=illustrated |first1=Mark |last1=Brake |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-49129-7 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC&amp;pg=PA63 Extract of page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmology|Cosmologists]] have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical [[universe]]: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space [[Shape of the universe|"go on forever"]]? This is an open question of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [[topology]]. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Quest of the Universe |edition=illustrated |first1=Theo |last1=Koupelis |first2=Karl F. |last2=Kuhn |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7637-4387-1 |page=553 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC&amp;pg=PA553 Extract of page 553]&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the universe can be measured through [[multipole moments]] in the spectrum of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the [[WMAP]] spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web| title=Will the Universe expand forever?| url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| publisher=NASA| date=24 January 2014| accessdate=16 March 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601032707/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| archivedate=1 June 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web| title=Our universe is Flat| url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| publisher=FermiLab/SLAC| date=7 April 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410200411/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unexpected connections|author=Marcus Y. Yoo|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|publisher=[[Caltech]]|volume=LXXIV1|date=2011|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=The Shape of Space|date=December 12, 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0824707095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of infinity also extends to the [[multiverse]] hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as [[Michio Kaku]], posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.&lt;ref&gt;Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
In [[logic]] an [[infinite regress]] argument is "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form&amp;nbsp;A) no such series exists or (form&amp;nbsp;B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;of justification) that it is supposed to play."&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Second Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;429&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing==
The [[IEEE&amp;nbsp;floating-point]] standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also [[NaN|indefinite]] values). These are defined as the result of [[arithmetic overflow]], [[division by zero]], and other exceptional operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The '''Inverse Symbolic Calculator''' is an online [[number checker]] established July 18, 1995 by [[Peter Benjamin Borwein]], [[Jonathan Michael Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]] of the Canadian Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (Burnaby, Canada). A user will input a number and the Calculator will use an algorithm to search for and calculate [[closed-form expression]]s or suitable functions that have roots near this number. Hence, the calculator is of great importance for those working in numerical areas of [[experimental mathematics]].

The ISC contains 54 million mathematical constants. [[Plouffe's Inverter]] (opened in 1998) contains 214 million. A newer version of the tables with 3.702 billion entries (as of June 19, 2010) exists.

In 2016, Plouffe released a portable version of Plouffe's Inverter containing 3 billion entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plouffe.fr/Simon%20Plouffe.htm |title=''Page maison de Simon Plouffe'' |publisher=plouffe.fr |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lemniscate of Bernoulli.svg|thumb|400px|right|The lemniscate of Bernoulli and its two foci]]

In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''lemniscate''' is any of several figure-eight or {{math|[[∞]]}}-shaped [[curve]]s.&lt;ref name="lemniscatomy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="erickson"/&gt; The word comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] "lēmniscātus" meaning "decorated with ribbons", from the Greek λημνίσκος meaning ribbons,&lt;ref name="erickson"&gt;{{citation|title=Beautiful Mathematics|series=MAA Spectrum|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|first=Martin J.|last=Erickson|year=2011|isbn=9780883855768|contribution=1.1 Lemniscate|pages=1–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgeP62-ZxikC&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively may refer to the [[wool]] from which the [[ribbons]] were made.&lt;ref name="lemniscatomy"/&gt;

Curves that have been called a lemniscate include three [[quartic plane curve]]s: the [[hippopede]] or lemniscate of Booth, the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]], and the [[lemniscate of Gerono]]. The study of lemniscates (and in particular the hippopede) dates to [[ancient Greek mathematics]], but the term "lemniscate" for curves of this type comes from the work of [[Jacob Bernoulli]] in the late 17th century.

==History and examples==

===Lemniscate of Booth===
[[File:Lemniscate of Booth.png|thumb|Lemniscate of Booth]]
{{main|Hippopede}}
The consideration of curves with a figure-eight shape can be traced back to [[Proclus]], a Greek [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 5th century AD. Proclus considered the [[Toric section|cross-sections]] of a [[torus]] by a plane parallel to the axis of the torus. As he observed, for most such sections the cross section consists of either one or two ovals; however, when the plane is [[tangent]] to the inner surface of the torus, the cross-section takes on a figure-eight shape, which Proclus called a [[Hobble (device)|horse fetter]] (a device for holding two feet of a horse together), or "hippopede" in Greek. The name "lemniscate of Booth" for this curve dates to its study by the 19th-century mathematician [[James Booth (mathematician)|James Booth]].&lt;ref name="lemniscatomy"&gt;{{citation

The lemniscate may be defined as an [[algebraic curve]], the zero set of the [[quartic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;(x^2 + y^2)^2 - cx^2 - dy^2&lt;/math&gt; when the parameter ''d'' is negative. For positive values of ''d'' one instead obtains the [[oval of Booth]].

===Lemniscate of Bernoulli===
[[File:Lemniskate bernoulli2.svg|thumb|Lemniscate of Bernoulli]]
{{main|Lemniscate of Bernoulli}}
In 1680, [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] studied a family of curves, now called the [[Cassini oval]], defined as follows: the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points, the product of whose distances from two fixed points, the curves' [[focus (geometry)|foci]], is a constant. Under very particular circumstances (when the half-distance between the points is equal to the square root of the constant) this gives rise to a lemniscate.

In 1694, [[Johann Bernoulli]] studied the lemniscate case of the Cassini oval, now known as the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]] (shown above), in connection with a problem of "[[Isochrone curve|isochrones]]" that had been posed earlier by [[Leibniz]]. Like the hippopede, it is an algebraic curve, the zero set of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2a^2 (x^2 - y^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Bernoulli's brother [[Jacob Bernoulli]] also studied the same curve in the same year, and gave it its name, the lemniscate.&lt;ref name="bos"&gt;{{citation

===Lemniscate of Gerono===

{{main|Lemniscate of Gerono}}
Another lemniscate, the [[lemniscate of Gerono]] or lemniscate of Huygens, is the zero set of the quartic polynomial &lt;math&gt;y^2-x^2(a^2-x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An elementary treatise on cubic and quartic curves|first=Alfred Barnard|last=Basset|publisher=Deighton, Bell|year=1901|pages=171–172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T40LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|contribution=The Lemniscate of Gerono}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Newton's Principia for the common reader|first=S|last=Chandrasekhar|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780198526759|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qomP58txKQwC&amp;pg=PA133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viviani's curve]], a three-dimensional curve formed by intersecting a sphere with a cylinder, also has a figure eight shape, and has the lemniscate of Gerono as its planar projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Luisa Rossi|last1=Costa|first2=Elena|last2=Marchetti|contribution=Mathematical and Historical Investigation on Domes and Vaults|pages=73–80|title=Aesthetics and architectural composition : proceedings of the Dresden International Symposium of Architecture 2004|year=2005|location=Mammendorf|publisher=Pro Literatur|editor1-last=Weber|editor1-first=Ralf|editor2-last=Amann|editor2-first=Matthias Albrecht}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

Other figure-eight shaped algebraic curves include
* The [[Devil's curve]], a curve defined by the quartic equation &lt;math&gt;y^2 (y^2 - a^2) = x^2 (x^2 - b^2)&lt;/math&gt; in which one connected component has a figure-eight shape,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Universal Book of Mathematics: From Abracadabra to Zeno's Paradoxes|first=David|last=Darling|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=9780471667001|contribution=devil's curve|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrOxRdtYYaMC&amp;pg=PA91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Watt's curve]], a figure-eight shaped curve formed by a mechanical linkage. Watt's curve is the zero set of the degree-six polynomial equation &lt;math&gt;(x^2+y^2)(x^2+y^2-d^2)^2+4a^2y^2(x^2+y^2-b^2)=0&lt;/math&gt; and has the lemniscate of Bernoulli as a special case.

The following list in [[mathematics]] contains the [[finite group]]s of small [[order (group theory)|order]] [[up to]] [[group isomorphism]].

== Counts ==
For &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; the number of nonisomorphic groups of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is
:1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, ... {{OEIS|A000001}}
For labeled groups, see {{oeis|A034383}}.

== Glossary ==
Each group is named by their [[#Small groups library|Small Groups library]] index as G&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''o'' is the order of the group, and ''i'' is the index of the group within that order.

Common group names:
* Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[cyclic group]] of order ''n'' (the notation C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also used; it is isomorphic to the [[additive group]] of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''').
* Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[dihedral group]] of order 2''n'' (often the notation D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is used )
** K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[Klein four-group]] of order 4, same as {{nowrap|Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or Dih&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[symmetric group]] of degree ''n'', containing the [[factorial|''n''!]] [[permutation]]s of ''n'' elements.
* A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[alternating group]] of degree ''n'', containing the [[even permutation]]s of ''n'' elements, of order 1 for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0, 1}}, and order ''n''!/2 otherwise.
* Dic&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or Q&lt;sub&gt;''4n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[dicyclic group]] of order 4''n''.
** Q&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[quaternion group]] of order 8, also Dic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The notations Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; have the advantage that [[point groups in three dimensions]] C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; do not have the same notation. There are more [[isometry group]]s than these two, of the same abstract group type.

The notation {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} denotes the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of the two groups; ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the direct product of a group with itself ''n'' times. ''G'' ⋊ ''H'' denotes a [[semidirect product]] where ''H'' acts on ''G''; this may also depend on the choice of action of ''H'' on ''G''

[[Abelian group|Abelian]] and [[simple group]]s are noted. (For groups of order {{nowrap|''n'' &lt; 60}}, the simple groups are precisely the cyclic groups Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for prime ''n''.) The equality sign ("=") denotes isomorphism.

The identity element in the [[cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graphs]] is represented by the black circle.  The lowest order for which the cycle graph does not uniquely represent a group is order 16.

In the lists of subgroups, the trivial group and the group itself are not listed.  Where there are several isomorphic subgroups, the number of such subgroups is indicated in parentheses.

== List of small abelian groups ==
The finite abelian groups are either cyclic groups, or direct products thereof; see [[abelian group]]s.
The numbers of nonisomorphic abelian groups of orders &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; are
:1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A000688}}
For labeled Abelian groups, see {{oeis|A034382}}.

== List of small non-abelian groups==
The numbers of non-abelian groups, by order, are counted by {{OEIS|id=A060689}}.
However, many orders have no non-abelian groups. The orders for which a non-abelian group exists are

==Classifying groups of small order==

Small groups of prime power order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are given as follows:
*Order ''p'': The only group is cyclic.
*Order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: There are just two groups, both abelian.
*Order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: There are three abelian groups, and two non-abelian groups. One of the non-abelian groups is the semidirect product of a normal cyclic subgroup of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by a cyclic group of order ''p''. The other is the quaternion group for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}} and a group of exponent ''p'' for {{nowrap|''p'' &gt; 2}}. 
*Order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: The classification is complicated, and gets much harder as the exponent of ''p'' increases.

Most groups of small order have a Sylow ''p'' subgroup ''P'' with a normal ''p''-complement ''N'' for some prime ''p'' dividing the order, so can be classified in terms of the possible primes ''p'', ''p''-groups ''P'', groups ''N'', and actions of ''P'' on ''N''. In some sense this reduces the classification of these groups to the classification of ''p''-groups. Some of the small groups that do not have a normal ''p'' complement include:
*Order 24: The symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
*Order 48: The binary octahedral group and the product {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; × Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
*Order 60: The alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Small groups library==
The group theoretical [[computer algebra system]] [[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]] contains the "Small Groups library" which provides access to descriptions of small order groups. The groups are listed [[up to]] [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]]. At present, the library contains the following groups:&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;Hans Ulrich Besche [http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/ag_algebra/software/small/ The Small Groups library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305020857/http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/ag_algebra/software/small/ |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* those of order at most 2000;
* those of cubefree order at most 50000 (395 703 groups);
* those of squarefree order;
* those of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n'' at most 6 and ''p'' prime;
* those of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; for ''p'' = 3, 5, 7, 11 (907 489 groups);
* those of order ''pq''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; divides 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, 5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; or 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and ''p'' is an arbitrary prime which differs from ''q'';
* those whose orders factorise into at most 3 primes (count with multiplicity).

It contains explicit descriptions of the available groups in computer readable format.

The smallest order for which the SmallGroups library does not have information is 2048.

The [[NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]] is a reference work maintained by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].
It defines a large number of '''terms relating to algorithms and data structures'''. For algorithms and data structures not necessarily mentioned here, see [[list of algorithms]] and [[list of data structures]].

This list of terms was originally derived from the index of that document, and is in the public domain, as it was compiled by a Federal Government employee as part of a Federal Government work.
Some of the terms defined are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1422">The '''Mathematical Society of Japan''' ('''MSJ''', {{lang-ja|日本数学会}}) was the first academic society in [[Japan]].

In 1877, the organization was established as the ''Tokyo Sugaku Kaisha.'' It was re-organized and re-established in its present form in 1946.

Today, the MSJ has more than 5,000 members.  They have the opportunity to participate in programs at MSJ meetings which take place in spring and autumn each year. They also have the opportunity to announce their own research at these meetings.

==Takebe Prizes==

In the context of its 50th anniversary celebrations, the Mathematical Society of Japan established the Takebe Prizes for the encouragement of those who show promise as mathematicians.  The award is named after [[Edo period]] mathematician {{nihongo|[[Takebe Kenkō|Takebe Katahiro]]|建部賢弘|1664-1739}} who is also known as [[Takebe Kenkō]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathsoc.jp  Mathematical Society of Japan], [http://mathsoc.jp/en/pamph/current/takebe_pr.html  Takebe Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">In [[mathematic]]s an '''operand''' is the object of a [[mathematical operation]], i.e. it is the object or quantity that is operated on.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example ==
The following [[arithmetic]] expression shows an example of operators and operands:

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 6 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called [[addition]]. 

The '''operand''' '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition [[Operator_(mathematics)|operator]], and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation.

The result of the operation is 9. (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)

An operand, then, is also referred to as "one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation".

==Notation==

===Expressions as operands===
Operands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.

:&lt;math&gt;(3 + 5) \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.

===Order of operations===
{{See also|Order of operations}}
Rules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=5 August 2012|at=Section IV&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2'.

===Positioning of operands===
Depending on the [[mathematical notation]] being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage [[infix notation]] is the most common,&lt;ref name="Infix, Postfix and Prefix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however other notations also exist, such as the [[prefix notation|prefix]] and [[postfix notation|postfix]] notations. These alternate notations are most common within [[computer science]].

Below is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; (infix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;+\;1\;2&lt;/math&gt; (prefix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;1\;2\;+&lt;/math&gt; (postfix notation)

===Infix notation and the order of operation===
{{main|Order of operations}}

In a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the left most value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 2^2)&lt;/math&gt;,

the first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reader is required to find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; before going any further. The value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 4)&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Our expression now looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

Having calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  We find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4. What we have left is the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 4 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

The next order of operation is multiplication. 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

The next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. 

So the correct value for our original expression, 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is 10. 

It is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.

===Arity===
The number of operands of an operator is called its [[arity]].&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47YC2h295JUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0198-7|page=3}}: "Each connective has associated with it a natural number, called its ''rank'', or ''arity''."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), [[unary operation|unary]] (1 operand), [[binary operation|binary]] (2 operands), [[ternary operation|ternary]] (3 operands) etc.

==Computer science==
In computer [[programming language]]s, the definitions of [[operator (programming)|operator]] and '''operand''' are almost the same as in mathematics.

In computing, an '''operand''' is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author =Nell Dale and John Lewis
  |title = Computer Science Illuminated, 5th Edition
  |year = 2012
  |publisher = Jones and Bartlett
  |ISBN =978-1449672843
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

Additionally, in [[assembly language]], an '''operand''' is a value (an argument) on which the [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]], named by [[mnemonic]], operates.  The operand may be a [[processor register]], a [[memory address]], a literal constant, or a label.  A simple example (in the [[x86]] architecture) is
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
MOV DS, AX
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
where the value in register operand &lt;code&gt;AX&lt;/code&gt; is to be moved (&lt;code&gt;[[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]]&lt;/code&gt;) into register &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on the [[instruction set|instruction]], there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.

The 1928 first edition thereof is considered the first elementary text clearly grounded in the formalism now known as [[first-order logic]] (FOL). Hilbert and Ackermann also formalized FOL in a way that subsequently achieved canonical status. FOL is now a core formalism of mathematical logic, and is presupposed by contemporary treatments of [[Peano arithmetic]] and nearly all treatments of [[axiomatic set theory]].

The 1928 edition included a clear statement of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] ([[decision problem]]) for FOL, and also asked whether that logic was [[Gödel's completeness theorem|complete]] (i.e., whether all semantic truths of FOL were theorems derivable from the FOL axioms and rules). The former problem was answered in the negative first by [[Alonzo Church]] and independently by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936.  The latter was answered affirmatively by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1929.

The text also touched on [[set theory]] and [[relational algebra]] as ways of going beyond FOL. Contemporary notation for logic owes more to this text than it does to the notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', long popular in the English speaking world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24165">This article gives a sketch of a proof of '''[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems#First incompleteness theorem|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]'''. This theorem applies to any formal theory that satisfies certain technical hypotheses, which are discussed as needed during the sketch. We will assume for the remainder of the article that a fixed theory satisfying these hypotheses has been selected.

Throughout this article the word "number" refers to a [[natural number]].  The key property these numbers possess is that any natural number can be obtained by starting with the number 0 and adding 1 a finite number of times.

== Hypotheses of the theory ==
Gödel's theorem applies to any formal theory that satisfies certain properties. Each [[Formal system|formal theory]] has a [[signature (logic)|signature]] that specifies the nonlogical symbols in the language of the theory.  For simplicity, we will assume that the language of the theory is composed from the following collection of 15 (and only 15) symbols:

* A constant symbol {{math|'''0'''}} for zero.
* A unary function symbol {{math|'''S'''}} for the [[Successor function|successor operation]] and two binary function symbols '''+''' and '''×''' for addition and multiplication.
* Three symbols for logical conjunction, {{math|'''∧'''}}, disjunction, {{math|'''∨'''}}, and negation, '''¬'''.
* Two symbols for universal, {{math|'''∀'''}}, and existential, {{math|'''∃'''}}, [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]].
* Two symbols for binary relations, '''=''' and '''&lt;''', for equality and order (less than).
* Two symbols for left, {{math|'''('''}} and right, {{math|''')'''}} parentheses for establishing precedence of quantifiers.
* A single variable symbol, {{math|'''x'''}} and a distinguishing symbol {{math|'''*'''}} that can be used to construct additional variables of the form ''x*'', ''x**'', ''x***'', ...

This is the language of [[Peano arithmetic]].  A [[well-formed formula]] is a sequence of these symbols that is formed so as to have a well-defined reading as a mathematical formula. Thus {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''SS''0}}  is well formed while {{math|''x'' {{=}} ∀+}} is not well formed. A theory is a set of well-formed formulas with no [[free variable]]s.

A theory is [[consistency proof|consistent]] if there is no formula {{math|''F''}} such that both {{math|''F''}} and its negation are provable.  [[omega-consistent|&amp;omega;-consistency]] is a stronger property than consistency.  Suppose that {{math|''F''(''x'')}} is a formula with one free variable {{math|''x''}}.  In order to be &amp;omega;-consistent,  the theory cannot prove both {{math|∃''m'' ''F''(''m'')}} while also proving {{math|¬''F''(''n'')}} for each natural number {{math|''n''}}.

The theory is assumed to be effective, which means that the set of axioms must be [[recursively enumerable]].  This means that it is theoretically possible to write a finite-length computer program that, if allowed to run forever, would output the axioms of the theory (necessarily including every well-formed instance of the [[Peano axioms#First-order theory of arithmetic|axiom schema of induction]]) one at a time and not output anything else. This requirement is necessary; there are theories that are [[Completeness (logic)|complete]], consistent, and include elementary arithmetic, but no such theory can be effective.

== Outline of the proof ==

: ''For a simplified outline of the proof, see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]''

The sketch here is broken into three parts.  In the first part, each formula of the theory is assigned a number, known as a Gödel number, in a manner that allows the formula to be effectively recovered from the number. This numbering is extended to cover finite sequences of formulas. In the second part, a specific formula {{math|''PF''(''x'', ''y'')}} is constructed such that for any two numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''m'', ''PF''(''n'',''m'')}} holds if and only if {{math|''n''}} represents a sequence of formulas that constitutes a proof of the formula that {{math|''m''}} represents.  In the third part of the proof, we construct a self-referential formula that, informally, says "I am not provable", and prove that this sentence is neither provable nor disprovable within the theory.

Importantly, all the formulas in the proof can be defined by [[primitive recursive function]]s, which themselves [[Primitive_recursive_function#Use_in_first-order_Peano_arithmetic|can be defined]] in [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano arithmetic]].

== Gödel numbering ==

The first step of the proof is to represent (well-formed) formulas of the theory, and finite lists of these formulas, as natural numbers. These numbers are called the '''[[Gödel number]]s''' of the formulas.

Begin by assigning a natural number to each symbol of the language of arithmetic, similar to the manner in which the [[ASCII]] code assigns a unique binary number to each letter and certain other characters. This article will employ the following assignment, very similar to the one [[Douglas Hofstadter]] used in his ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'':

{|
|- valign=top
| style="padding-right:60px" |

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Number !! Symbol !! Meaning
|-
| 666 || 0 || zero
|-
| 123 || {{math|S}} || successor function
|-
| 111 || = || equality relation
|-
| 212 || &lt; || less than relation
|-
| 112 || + || addition operator
|-
| 236 || ✕ || multiplication operator
|-
| 362 || ( || left parenthesis
|-
| 323 || ) || right parenthesis
|}

|

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Number !! Symbol !! Meaning
|-
| 262 || {{math|''x''}} || a variable name
|-
| 163 || * || star (used to make more variables)
|-
| 333 || ∃ || existential quantifier
|-
| 626 || ∀ || for all
|-
| 161 || ∧ || logical and
|-
| 616 || ∨ || logical or
|-
| 223 || ¬ || logical not
|}

|}

The Gödel number of a formula is obtained by concatenating the Gödel numbers of each symbol making up the formula. The Gödel numbers for each symbol are separated by a zero because by design, no Gödel number of a symbol includes a {{math|0}}. Hence any formula may be correctly recovered from its Gödel number. Let {{math|''G''(''F'')}} denote the Gödel number of the formula {{math|''F''}}.

Given the above Gödel numbering, the sentence asserting that addition [[commutativity|commutes]], {{math|∀''x'' ∀''x''* (''x'' + ''x''* {{=}} ''x''* + ''x'')}} translates as the number:

: {{math|626 0 262 0 626 0 262 0 163 0 362 0 262 0 112 0 262 0 163 0 111 0 262 0 163 0 112 0 262 0 323}}

(Spaces have been inserted on each side of every 0 only for readability; Gödel numbers are strict concatenations of decimal digits.)  Not all natural numbers represent a formula. For example, the number

: {{math|111 0 626 0 112 0 262}}

translates to "{{math|{{=}} ∀ + ''x''}}", which is not well-formed.

Because each natural number can be obtained by applying the [[Successor (graph theory)|successor]] operation {{math|''S''}} to {{math|0}} a finite number of times, every natural number has its own Gödel number. For example, the Gödel number corresponding to {{math|4, ''SSSS''0}}, is:

: {{math|123 0 123 0 123 0 123 0 666}}.

The assignment of Gödel numbers can be extended to finite lists of formulas. To obtain the Gödel number of a list of formulas, write the Gödel numbers of the formulas in order, separating them by two consecutive zeros. Since the Gödel number of a formula never contains two consecutive zeros, each formula in a list of formulas can be effectively recovered from the Gödel number for the list.

It is crucial that the formal arithmetic be capable of proving a minimum set of facts. In particular, it must be able to prove that every number has a Gödel number. A second fact that the theory must prove is that given any Gödel number of a formula {{math|''F''(''x'')}} with one free variable {{math|''x''}} and any number {{math|''m''}}, there is a Gödel number of the formula {{math|''F''(''m'')}} obtained by replacing all occurrences of {{math|''G''(''x'')}} in {{math|''G''(''F''(''x''))}} with {{math|''G''(''m'')}}, and that this second Gödel number can be effectively obtained from the Gödel number of {{math|''F''}} as a function of {{math|''m''}}. To see that this is in fact possible, note that given the Gödel number for {{math|''F''}}, one can recreate the original formula, make the substitution, and then find the Gödel number of the resulting formula. This is a uniform procedure.

== The provability relation ==

Deduction rules can then be represented by binary relations on Gödel numbers of lists of formulas.  In other words, suppose that there is a deduction rule {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, by which one can move from the formulas {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to a new formula {{math|''S''}}.  Then the relation {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponding to this deduction rule says that {{math|''n''}} is related to {{math|''m''}} (in other words, {{math|''n'' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''m''}} holds) if {{math|''n''}} is the Gödel number of a list of formulas containing {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''}} is the Gödel number of the list of formulas consisting of those in the list coded by {{math|''n''}} together with {{math|''S''}}.  Because each deduction rule is concrete, it is possible to effectively determine for any natural numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''m''}} whether they are related by the relation.

The second stage in the proof is to use the Gödel numbering, described above, to show that the notion of provability can be expressed within the formal language of the theory. Suppose the theory has deduction rules: {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;}} . Let {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;}} be their corresponding relations, as described above.

Every provable statement is either an axiom itself, or it can be deduced from the axioms by a finite number of applications of the deduction rules. We wish to define a set of numbers {{math|''P''}} that represents all these provable statements. We define {{math|''P''}} as the minimal set consisting of all numbers in {{math|''AX''}} (representing axioms) and closed under all the relations {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;}} .  This means that whenever {{math|''n''}} is in the set {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''n'' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ''m''}} for some numbers {{math|''m''}}  and {{math|''i''}}, the number {{math|''m''}} is also in the set {{math|''P''}}.  It is not hard to see that {{math|''P''}} represents the set of provable statements. That is, the members of {{math|''P''}} are the [[Gödel number]]s of the provable statements.
&lt;!-- 
Comment: This is not really necessary - it is clear from the above that any formula has a Godel number, including {{math|''x''}} as many times as is desired

Let {{math|''F''(''x'')}} be a formula with one free variable {{math|''x''}}. An example to such a statement is {{math|∃''y'' (''y'' + ''y'' {{=}} ''x'')}}. We will discuss such statements of the form: "for every {{math|''y'', ''x'' {{=}} ''y''}} implies…" (a statement on {{math|''y''}}). Thus instead of "{{math|''x''}} is even" we will have "for every {{math|''y'', ''x'' {{=}} ''y''}} implies {{math|''y''}} is even". In such a way, {{math|''x''}} appears within {{math|''F''(''x'')}} only in a prefixed location, and one may define the [[Gödel number]] {{math|''G''(''F'')}} of every such {{math|''F''(''x'')}} (and independently of {{math|''x''}}) by the [[Gödel number]] of the statement on {{math|''y''}}. Then, {{math|''G''(''F''(''n''))}} can be constructed from the [[Gödel number]]s of "for every {{math|''y''", ''x'', "{{=}}''y''}} implies" and {{math|''G''(''F'')}}.
 --&gt;

A proof of a formula {{math|''S''}} is itself a string of mathematical statements related by  particular relations (each is either an axiom or related to former statements by deduction rules), where the last statement is {{math|''S''}}. Thus one can define the [[Gödel number]] of a proof. Moreover, one may define a statement form {{math|''PF''(''x'',''y'')}}, which for every two numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is provable if and only if {{math|''x''}} is the [[Gödel number]] of a proof of the statement {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''G''(''S'')}}.

{{math|''PF''(''x'',''y'')}} is in fact an arithmetical relation, just as "{{math|''x'' + ''y'' {{=}} 6}}" is, though a (much) more complicated one. Given such a relation {{math|''R''(''x'',''y'')}}, for any two specific numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''m''}}, either the formula {{math|''R''(''m'',''n'')}}, or its negation {{math|¬''R''(''m'',''n'')}}, but not both, is provable. This is because the relation between these two numbers can be simply "checked". Formally this can be proven by induction, where all these possible relations (which are of infinite number) are constructed one by one.
The detailed construction of the formula {{math|''PF''}} makes essential use of the assumption that the theory is effective; it would not be possible to construct this formula without such an assumption.

== Self-referential formula ==

For every number {{math|''n''}} and every formula {{math|''F''(''y'')}}, where {{math|''y''}} is a free variable,  we define {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}}, a relation between two numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''G''(''F'')}}, such  that it corresponds to the statement "{{math|''n''}} is not the Gödel number of a proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}". Here, {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}} can be understood as {{math|''F''}} with its own Gödel number as its argument.

Note that {{math|''q''}} takes as an argument {{math|''G''(''F'')}}, the Gödel number of {{math|''F''}}. In order to prove either {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}}, or {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}}, it is necessary to perform number-theoretic operations on {{math|''G''(''F'')}} that mirror the following steps: decode the number {{math|''G''(''F'')}} into the formula {{math|''F''}}, replace all occurrences of {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''F''}} with the number {{math|''G''(''F'')}}, and then compute the Gödel number of the resulting formula {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}.

Note that for every specific number {{math|''n''}} and formula {{math|''F''(''y''), ''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}} is a straightforward (though complicated) arithmetical relation between two numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''G''(''F'')}}, building on the relation {{math|''PF''}} defined earlier. Further, {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}}  is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by {{math|''n''}} is not a proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}, and {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}} is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by {{math|''n''}} is a proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}. Given any numbers {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''G''(''F'')}}, either {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}} or {{math|¬''q''(''n'',''G''(''F''))}} (but not both) is provable.

Any proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}} can be encoded by a Gödel number {{math|''n''}}, such that {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}} does not hold. If {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''F''))}} holds for all natural numbers {{math|''n''}}, then there is no proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}. In other words,  {{math|∀''y'' ''q''(''y'', ''G''(''F''))}}, a formula about natural numbers, corresponds to "there is no proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}".

We now define the formula {{math|''P''(''x'') {{=}} ∀''y'' ''q''(''y'', ''x'')}}, where {{math|''x''}} is a free variable. The formula {{math|''P''}} itself has a Gödel number {{math|''G''(''P'')}} as does every formula.

This formula has a free variable {{math|''x''}}. Suppose we replace it with {{math|''G''(''F'')}},
the Gödel number of a formula {{math|''F''(''z'')}}, where {{math|''z''}} is a free variable. Then, {{math|''P''(''G''(''F'')) {{=}} ∀''y'' ''q''(''y'', ''G''(''F''))}} corresponds to "there is no proof of {{math|''F''(''G''(''F''))}}", as we have seen.

Consider the formula {{math|''P''(''G''(''P'')) {{=}} ∀''y'', ''q''(''y'', ''G''(''P''))}}. This formula concerning the number {{math|''G''(''P'')}} corresponds to "there is no proof of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}}". We have here the self-referential feature that is crucial to the proof: A formula of the formal theory that somehow relates to its own provability within that formal theory. Very informally, {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} says: "I am not provable".

We will now show that neither the formula {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}}, nor its negation {{math|¬''P''(''G''(''P''))}},  is provable.

Suppose {{math|''P''(''G''(''P'')) {{=}} ∀''y'', ''q''(''y'', ''G''(''P''))}} is provable. Let {{math|''n''}} be the Gödel number of a proof of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}}. Then, as seen earlier, the formula {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}}  is provable. Proving both {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} and {{math|∀''y'' ''q''(''y'', ''G''(''P''))}} violates the [[consistency]] of the formal theory. We therefore conclude that {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} is not provable.

Consider any number {{math|''n''}}. Suppose {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} is provable.
Then, {{math|''n''}} must be the Gödel number of a proof of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}}. But we have just proved that {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} is not provable. Since either {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} or {{math|¬''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} must be provable, we conclude that, for all natural numbers {{math|''n'', ''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} is provable.

Suppose the negation of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}}, {{math|¬''P''(''G''(''P'')) {{=}} ∃''x'' ¬ ''q''(''x'', ''G''(''P''))}}, is provable. Proving both {{math|∃''x'' ¬''q''(''x'', ''G''(''P''))}}, and {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}}, for all natural numbers {{math|''n''}}, violates  [[omega-consistent|&amp;omega;-consistency]] of the formal theory. Thus if the theory is [[omega-consistent|&amp;omega;-consistent]], {{math|¬''P''(''G''(''P''))}} is not provable.

We have sketched a proof showing that:

For any formal, recursively enumerable (i.e. effectively generated) theory of [[Peano Arithmetic]],

: if it is [[consistent]], then there exists an unprovable formula (in the language of that theory).

: if it is [[omega-consistent|&amp;omega;-consistent]], then there exists a formula such that both it and its negation are unprovable.

=== The truth of the Gödel sentence ===

The proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem just sketched is '''proof-theoretic''' (also called '''syntactic''') in that it shows that if certain proofs exist (a proof of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} or its negation) then they can be manipulated to produce a proof of a contradiction.  This makes no appeal to whether {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} is "true", only to whether it is provable. Truth is a '''[[Model theory|model-theoretic]]''', or '''semantic''', concept, and is not equivalent to provability except in special cases.

By analyzing the situation of the above proof in more detail, it is possible to obtain a conclusion about the truth of {{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} in the standard model ℕ of natural numbers. As just seen, {{math|''q''(''n'', ''G''(''P''))}} is provable for each natural number {{math|''n''}}, and is thus true in the model ℕ. Therefore, within this model,

: &lt;math&gt;P(G(P)) = \forall y\,q(y, G(P))&lt;/math&gt;

holds. This is what the statement "{{math|''P''(''G''(''P''))}} is true" usually refers to&amp;mdash;the sentence is true in the intended model.  It is not true in every model, however: If it were, then by Gödel's [[completeness theorem]] it would be provable, which we have just seen is not the case.

== Boolos's short proof ==

[[George Boolos]] (1989) vastly simplified the proof of the First Theorem, if one agrees that the [[theorem]] is equivalent to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There is no [[algorithm]] {{math|''M''}} whose output contains all true sentences of arithmetic and no false ones."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Arithmetic" refers to [[Peano axioms|Peano]] or [[Robinson arithmetic]], but the proof invokes no specifics of either, tacitly assuming that these systems allow '&lt;' and '&amp;times;' to have their usual meanings. Boolos proves the theorem in about two pages. His proof employs the language of [[first-order logic]], but invokes no facts about the [[logical connective|connectives]] or [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. The [[domain of discourse]] is the [[natural number]]s. The [[Gödel sentence]] builds on [[Berry's paradox]].

Let {{math|[''n'']}} abbreviate {{math|''n''}} successive applications of the [[successor function]], starting from {{math|0}}. Boolos then asserts (the details are only sketched) that there exists a defined predicate {{math|''Cxz''}} that comes out true [[iff]] an arithmetic formula containing {{math|''z''}} symbols names the number {{math|''x''}}. This proof sketch contains the only mention of [[Gödel number]]ing; Boolos merely assumes that every formula can be so numbered. Here, a formula {{math|''F'' }}''names'' the number {{math|''n''}} iff the following is provable:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (F(x) \leftrightarrow x=n)&lt;/math&gt;

Boolos then defines the related predicates:

* {{math|''Bxy'' &amp;harr; &amp;exist;''z''(''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' &amp;and; ''Cxz'')}}. (English: {{math|''Bxy''}} comes out true if {{math|''x''}} can be defined in fewer than {{math|''y''}} symbols):
* {{math|''Axy'' &amp;harr; &amp;not;''Bxy'' &amp;and; &amp;forall;''a''(''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;rarr;''Bay'')}}. (English: {{math|''Axy''}} comes out true if {{math|''x''}} is the smallest number not definable in fewer than {{math|''y''}} symbols. More awkwardly, {{math|''Axy''}} holds if {{math|''x''}} cannot be defined in fewer than {{math|''y''}} symbols, and all numbers less than {{math|''x''}} can be defined using fewer than {{math|''y''}} symbols);
* {{math|''Fx'' &amp;harr; &amp;exist;''y''((''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;[10] &amp;times; [''k'']) &amp;and; ''Axy'')}}. {{math|''k''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;}}the number of symbols appearing in {{math|''Axy''}}.

{{math|''Fx''}} formalizes Berry's paradox. The balance of the proof, requiring but 12 lines of text, shows that the sentence {{math|&amp;forall;''x''(''Fx''&amp;harr;(''x''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;[''n'']))}} is true for some number {{math|''n''}}, but no algorithm {{math|''M''}} will identify it as true. Hence in arithmetic, truth outruns proof. QED.

The above predicates contain the only [[existential quantifier]]s appearing in the entire proof. The '&lt;' and '&amp;times;' appearing in these predicates are the only defined arithmetical notions the proof requires. The proof nowhere mentions [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s or any facts from [[number theory]], and Boolos claims that his proof dispenses with [[diagonal lemma|diagonalization]]. For more on this proof, see [[Berry's paradox]].

In [[quantum chaos]], a branch of [[mathematical physics]], '''quantum ergodicity''' is a property of the [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] of [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical systems]] that are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] in the sense of exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.   Quantum ergodicity states, roughly, that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated to [[energy eigenstates]] of a quantized [[ergodic]] [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] tend to a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] in the classical [[phase space]].  This is consistent with the intuition that the flows of ergodic systems are equidistributed in phase space.  By contrast, classical [[completely integrable system]]s generally have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is exhibited in a variety of ways in the high-energy limit of the eigenstates: typically that some form of concentration or "scarring" occurs in the limit.

The model case of a Hamiltonian is the [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows|geodesic Hamiltonian]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]].  The quantization of the geodesic flow is given by the [[fundamental solution]] of the [[Schrödinger equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;U_t=\exp(it\sqrt{\Delta})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; is the square root of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]]. The '''quantum ergodicity theorem''' of Shnirelman, [[Yves Colin de Verdière]], and [[Steven Zelditch|Zelditch]] states that a compact Riemannian manifold whose [[unit tangent bundle]] is ergodic under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated to the ''n''th eigenfunction of the Laplacian tends weakly to the uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; in a subset of the natural numbers of [[natural density]] equal to one. Quantum ergodicity can be formulated as a non-commutative analogue of the classical ergodicity ([[Toshikazu Sunada|T. Sunada]]).

{{seealso|Universal approximation theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''representation theorem''' is a theorem that states that every abstract structure with certain properties is [[isomorphic]] to another (abstract or concrete) structure. 

For example, 
*in algebra, 
** [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
**:[[Representation theory]]  studies properties of abstract groups via their representations as linear transformations of vector spaces. 
** [[Stone's representation theorem]] for [[Boolean algebra]]s states that every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is isomorphic to a field of sets. 
**: A variant, Stone's representation theorem for  lattices states that every [[distributive lattice]] is isomorphic to a sublattice of the [[power set]] lattice of some set.
**: Another variant states that there exists a duality (in the sense of an arrow reversing equivalence) between the categories of [[Boolean algebra]]s and that of [[Stone space]]s.
** The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] states that every [[Lie algebra]] embeds into the commutator Lie algebra of its [[universal enveloping algebra]]. 
** [[Ado's theorem]] states that every finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]] embeds into the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of some finite-dimensional vector space.
** [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] states that every [[model (model theory)|model]] of an algebra ''A'' is the homomorphic image of a [[subalgebra]] of a [[direct product]] of copies of ''A''.
*in category theory, 
** The [[Yoneda lemma]] provides a full and faithful limit-preserving embedding of any category into a category of [[presheaves]].
** [[Mitchell's embedding theorem]] for abelian categories realises every small abelian category as a full (and exactly embedded) subcategory of a category of modules over some ring.
**[[Mostowski collapse lemma|Mostowski's collapsing theorem]] states that every well-founded extensional structure is isomorphic to a transitive set with the ∈-relation.
** One of the fundamental theorems in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory states that every sheaf over a [[topological space]] can be thought of as a sheaf of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of some (étalé) bundle over that space: the categories of sheaves on a topological space and that of [[étalé space]]s over it are equivalent, where the equivalence is given by the functor that sends a bundle to its sheaf of (local) sections.
*in functional analysis
** The [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] embeds any [[C*-algebra]] in an algebra of [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]].
** The [[Gelfand representation]] (also known as the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem) states that any commutative [[C*-algebra]] is isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions on its [[Gelfand spectrum]]. It can also be seen as the construction as a duality between the category of commutative [[C*-algebras]] and that of [[compact Hausdorff space]]s.
** The [[Riesz representation theorem]] is actually a list of several theorems; one of them identifies the dual space of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with the set of regular measures on ''X''.
*in geometry
** The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]s embed any abstract [[manifold]] in some [[Euclidean space]].
** The [[Nash embedding theorem]] embeds an abstract [[Riemannian manifold]] isometrically in a [[Euclidean space]].

In [[mathematics]], '''LHS''' is informal shorthand for the '''left-hand side''' of an [[equation]].  Similarly, '''RHS''' is the '''right-hand side'''. The two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] is [[equivalence relation|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_BhgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=rhs+equation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5e0lDtBkTr&amp;sig=F_b0X-tls1pEUlFiS-LTUyUuhgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwi8nqXt7YDHAhXHxRQKHYJJBcY#v=onepage&amp;q=rhs%20equation&amp;f=false Engineering Mathematics, John Bird, p65]: definition and example of abbreviation&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, these terms may apply to an [[inequation]] or [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a [[test operator]] in an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]], with LHS defined similarly.

==Some examples==
The expression on the right side of the "=" sign is the right side of the equation and the expression on the left of the "=" is the left side of the equation.

For example, in
:''x'' + 5 = ''y ''+ 8,
"''x'' + 5" is the '''left-hand side''' (LHS) and "''y ''+ 8" is the '''right-hand side''' (RHS).

==Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations==
In solving mathematical equations, particularly [[linear simultaneous equations]], [[differential equation]]s and [[integral equation]]s, the terminology ''homogeneous'' is often used for equations with some [[linear operator]] ''L'' on the LHS and 0 on the RHS. In contrast, an equation with a non-zero RHS is called ''inhomogeneous'' or ''non-homogeneous'', as exemplified by

:''Lf'' = ''g'',

with ''g'' a fixed function, which equation is to be solved for ''f''. Then any solution of the inhomogeneous equation may have a solution of the homogeneous equation added to it, and still remain a solution.

For example in [[mathematical physics]], the homogeneous equation may correspond to a physical theory formulated in [[Free space|empty space]], while the inhomogeneous equation asks for more 'realistic' solutions with some matter, or charged particles.

==Syntax==
More abstractly, when using [[infix notation]]

:''T'' * ''U''

the term ''T'' stands as the '''left-hand side''' and ''U'' as the '''right-hand side''' of the [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] *. This usage is less common, though.

In [[mathematics]], a '''space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (sometimes called a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]]) with some added [[mathematical structure|structure]].

While modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as [[Euclidean space]]s, [[linear space]]s, [[topological space]]s, [[Hilbert space]]s, or [[probability space]]s, it does not define the notion of "space" itself.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/177937/difference-between-space-and-mathematical-structure |title=Difference between 'space' and 'mathematical structure'?|first1= Kevin|last1= Carlson|date=August 2, 2012|work=Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Similarly, several types of numbers are in use (natural, integral, rational, real, complex); each one has its own definition; but just "number" is not used as a mathematical notion and has no definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

A space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. 
The nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an [[isomorphism]] between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms,&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms&gt;Reformed [[Euclidean_geometry#Logical_basis|by Hilbert, Tarski and Birkhoff]] in order to avoid hidden assumptions found in [[w:Euclid's Elements|Euclid's Elements]].&lt;/ref&gt; and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.

Topological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. 
However, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus "forgetful". Relations of this kind are sketched in Figure 1, and treated in more detail in the Section [[#Types of spaces|"Types of spaces"]]. 

It is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric "space", or an  algebraic "structure". A general definition of "structure", proposed by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]],&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Chapter IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.

===Before the golden age of geometry===

[[File:Homothety.svg|thumb|275px|Homothety transforms a geometric figure into a similar one by scaling.]]

In ancient Greek mathematics, "space" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, [[Euclid]] gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.

The method of coordinates ([[analytic geometry]]) was adopted by [[René Descartes]] in 1637.&lt;ref name="EDM987"&gt;{{harvnb|Itô|1993|loc=page 987}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science;&lt;ref name=Bb94&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bourbaki | first = Nicolas | author-link=w:Nicolas Bourbaki | title = Elements of the history of mathematics | year = 1994 | publisher = Masson (original), Springer (translation) |isbn=978-3-540-64767-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-61693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Two [[equivalence relation]]s between geometric figures were used: [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]] — into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by [[Gaspard Monge]] in 1795, occurs in [[projective geometry]]: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.

The relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} shows that mathematical objects are not given to us ''with their structure''.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|21}} Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by ''some'' of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|20}}

Distances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.

A different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]], introduced by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] in 1829 and [[János Bolyai]] in 1832 (and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1816, unpublished)&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868 and [[Felix Klein]] in 1871 obtained Euclidean "models" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Jeremy Gray |first1=Jeremy |last1= Gray |date=1989 |title=Ideas of Space: Euclidean, Non-Euclidean and Relativistic |edition=second |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0198539353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not "obvious", nor "implications of definitions". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a "geometry" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less "mathematical truths".&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

A Euclidean model of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations "play" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.

===The golden age and afterwards===
The word "geometry" (from Ancient Greek: geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).

According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|131}} the period between 1795 (''Géométrie descriptive'' of Monge) and 1872 (the [[Erlangen program|"Erlangen programme"]] of Klein) can be called the golden age of geometry.  The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with [[Hilbert's axioms]], [[Tarski's axioms]] and [[Birkhoff's axioms]]. These axiom systems describe the space via [[primitive notion]]s (such as "point", "between", "congruent") constrained by a number of [[axiom]]s.

Analytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|134,5}} Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|136}} However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}} "passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics".

Simultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics.  For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay ''Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen'' (''Continuity and irrational numbers''), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of [[Dedekind cut]]s, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers.  Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven.  In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic.  Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Gallier |title=Geometric Methods and Applications |chapter=Basics of Euclidean geometry |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-9961-0_6 |isbn=978-1-4419-9960-3 |publisher=Springer |date=2011}} See also [http://ocw.upm.es/algebra/affine-and-projective-geometry-1/class-material OpenCourseWare].&lt;/ref&gt; A definition "from scratch", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional [[projective space]] is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space.  This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.

A space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called "spaces" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.

According to the famous inaugural lecture given by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by ''n'' real numbers may be treated as a point of the ''n''-dimensional space of all such objects.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|140}} Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}}

[[w:Function (mathematics)|Functions]] are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional [[function space]]s, as noted already by Riemann&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|141}} and elaborated in the 20th century by [[functional analysis]].

== Taxonomy of spaces ==

===Three taxonomic ranks===
While each type of spaces has its own definition, the general idea of "space" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of "structure".
According to Pudlák,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-00118-0|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00119-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have."
We will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section "Spaces and structures", while  we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.

We classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.

For example, the ''upper-level classification'' distinguishes between Euclidean and [[projective space]]s, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. 
Another example. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.

Also, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question "what is the dimension" makes sense in both cases.

The ''second-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.
In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the second-level classification is the classification by "species". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.

The ''third-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.
More formally, the third level classifies spaces up to [[isomorphism]]. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.

The notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.

An isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.

Euclidean axioms&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms /&gt; leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have "the" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is ''univalent''. In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is ''multivalent''. A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name="BSr385"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=page 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.

===Relations between species of spaces===
Topological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called "[[homeomorphism]]"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; "topological space" is an ''underlying'' structure of the "Euclidean space" structure. Similar ideas occur in [[category theory]]: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the [[Forgetful functor|forgetful]] (or "stripping") [[functor]] maps the former category to the latter category.

A three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is ''richer'' than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.

[[File:Spaces arrows.svg|thumb|200px|Example relations between species of spaces]]

Such relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every {{nowrap|A-space}} is also a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or may be treated as a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or provides a {{nowrap|B-space,}} etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "procedure of deduction" of a {{nowrap|B-space}} from a {{nowrap|A-space.}} Not quite a function unless the [[Class (set theory)|classes]] A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. 

The transition from "Euclidean" to "topological" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, [[self-homeomorphism]]) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.

In contrast, the transition from "3-dim Euclidean" to "Euclidean" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is [[Injective function|injective]] (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, "↣" rather than "→".

Both transitions are not [[Surjective function|surjective]], that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, "↠" rather than "→". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from "real linear topological" to "real linear" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.

Such topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, [[Bijection|bijective]]; see the arrow from "finite-dim real linear topological" to "finite-dim real linear" on Fig. 4. The [[Inverse function|inverse]] transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.

The transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic {{nowrap|A-spaces}} lead to two isomorphic {{nowrap|B-spaces}}.

The diagram on Fig. 4 is [[Commutative diagram|commutative]]. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from "topological" to "measurable" is dashed for the reason explained there: "In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a σ-algebra. The σ-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice." A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called "canonical" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the [[Fine topology (potential theory)|fine topology]]; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.

==Types of spaces==

===Linear and topological spaces===
[[File:Spaces linear etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: linear, topological etc]]

Two basic spaces are [[w:linear space|linear spaces]] (also called vector spaces) and [[w:topological space|topological spaces]].

Linear spaces are of [[w:Algebra|algebraic]] nature; there are real linear spaces (over the [[w:field (mathematics)|field]] of [[w:Real number|real numbers]]),
complex linear spaces (over the field of [[w:Complex number|complex numbers]]), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter ''underlies'' the former), since each real number is also a complex number.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;For example, the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]] treated as a one-dimensional complex linear space may be downgraded to a two-dimensional real linear space. In contrast, the real line can be treated as a one-dimensional real linear space but not a complex linear space. See also [[w:Examples of vector spaces#Field extensions|field extensions]].&lt;/ref&gt;
More generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.
Linear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define 
orthogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space 
there is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} complex linear space is also a {{nowrap|2''n''-dimensional}} real linear space.

Topological spaces are of [[Mathematical analysis|analytic]] nature. [[Open set]]s, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as [[continuous function]]s, paths, maps; [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequences, limits]]; interior, boundary, exterior. However, [[uniform continuity]], [[bounded set]]s, [[Cauchy sequence]]s, [[differentiable function]]s (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The [[open interval]] (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole [[w:Real line|real line]] (-∞,∞) but not homeomorphic to the [[closed interval]] [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; [[inductive dimension]] (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and [[Lebesgue covering dimension (mathematics)|Lebesgue covering dimension]] can be used. In the case of a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to ''n''.

Every subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only ''linear'' subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by [[general topology]] (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. [[Compact space|Compact topological spaces]] are an important class of topological spaces ("species" of this "type"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the [[extended real line]] [-∞,∞] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (-∞,∞) are not. Geometric topology investigates [[Manifold (geometry)|manifolds]] (another "species" of this "type"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.

Both the linear and topological structures underly the [[Topological vector space|linear topological space]] (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. 

Every finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, "finite-dimensional real or complex linear space" and "finite-dimensional linear topological space", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.

===Affine and projective spaces===
[[File:Spaces affine etc.svg|thumb|250px|Relations between mathematical spaces: affine, projective etc]]

It is convenient to introduce [[w:Affine space|affine]] and [[w:Projective space|projective spaces]] by means of linear spaces, as follows. A {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear subspace of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space, being itself a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine spaces are mutually isomorphic. In the words of [[w:John C. Baez|John Baez]], "an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.

Given an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace ''A'' in a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space ''L'', a straight line in ''A'' may be defined as the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace  of ''L'' that intersects ''A'': in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to ''A''. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} affine subspace of ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L'' that intersects ''A''.

Every point of the affine subspace ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L''. However, some {{nobr|one-dimensional}} subspaces of ''L'' are parallel to ''A''; in some sense, they intersect ''A'' at infinity. The set of all {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspaces of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space is, by definition, a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} projective space. And the affine subspace ''A'' is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective space.

Defined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.

Every real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.

===Metric and uniform spaces===
[[File:Spaces metric etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: metric, uniform etc]]

Distances between points are defined in a [[w:Metric space|metric space]]. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called [[w:Metrizable|metrizable]], if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.

In a metric space, we can define 
bounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called [[w:Complete metric space|complete]] if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. 

Every Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points ''A'' and ''C'' consists of all points ''B'' such that the distance between ''A'' and ''C'' is equal to the sum of two distances, between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''B'' and ''C''.

The [[w:Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff dimension]] (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for [[w:Fractal|fractals]]). For a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to ''n''.

[[w:Uniform space|Uniform spaces]] do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or [[w:Filter (mathematics)#Cauchy filters|filters]] or [[w:Net (mathematics)#Cauchy nets|nets]]), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every ''linear'' topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.

===Normed, Banach, inner product, and Hilbert spaces===
[[File:Spaces Hilbert etc.svg|thumb|360px|Relations between mathematical spaces: normed, Banach etc]]

Vectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; has also a length, in other words, norm, &lt;math&gt;\lVert x\rVert&lt;/math&gt;. A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a [[w:Normed vector space|normed space]]. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A [[w:Banach space|Banach space]] is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

The set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or. more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) 
:&lt;math&gt; \lVert x-y\rVert^2 + \lVert x+y\rVert^2 = 2 \lVert x\rVert^2 + 2 \lVert y \rVert^2\ ,
&lt;/math&gt; 
generally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, &lt;math&gt; \lVert x\rVert^2 = (x, x)&lt;/math&gt;.

An [[w:Inner product space|inner product space]] is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A [[w:Hilbert space|Hilbert space]] is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for [[w:Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanczos|first1=Cornelius|author-link=w:Cornelius Lanczos|date= 1970|title=Space through the Ages: The Evolution of Geometrical Ideas from Pythagoras to Hilbert and Einstein|page=269|publisher=[[w:Academic Press|Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0124358508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space is the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product space that forgot its origin.

===Smooth and Riemannian manifolds ===
[[File:Spaces smooth etc.svg|thumb|330px|Relations between mathematical spaces: smooth, Riemannian etc]]

[[w:Smooth manifold|Smooth manifolds]] are not called "spaces", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space  are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.

At each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} smooth manifold are {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. 

A [[w:Riemannian manifold|Riemannian manifold]], or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic {{nowrap|non-Euclidean}} space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.

Waiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains [[w:Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemann spaces]], including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for [[w:General relativity|general relativity]].

===Measurable, measure, and probability spaces===
[[File:Spaces measurable etc.svg|thumb|390px|Relations between mathematical spaces: measurable, measure etc]]

Waiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches [[w:measure theory|measure theory]]. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to [[w:Andrey Kolmogorov|Andrey Kolmogorov's]] approach to [[w:probability theory|probability theory]].

A "geometric body" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called [[w:Measurable set|measurable sets]]. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.

Measurable sets, given in a [[w:Measurable space|measurable space]] by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a [[w:Sigma-algebra|{{nowrap|σ-algebra.}}]] The {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of [[w:Borel set|Borel sets]] is the most popular, but not the only choice. ([[w:Baire set|Baire sets]], [[w:Universally measurable set|universally measurable sets]], etc, are also used sometimes.) 
The topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra;}} for example, the [[w:Norm topology|norm topology]] and the [[w:Weak topology|weak topology]] on a [[w:Separable space|separable]] Hilbert space lead to the same Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}}.
Not every {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} is the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of some topology.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;
The space &lt;math&gt;2^{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; (equipped with its [[w:Product measure|tensor product]] {{nowrap|σ-algebra)}} has a measurable structure which is not generated by a topology. A slick proof can be found in [http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology/87888#87888 this answer] on [[w:MathOverflow|''MathOverflow'']].&lt;/ref&gt;
Actually, a {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology.  Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.

Standard measurable spaces (also called [[w:Standard Borel space|standard Borel spaces]]) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Standard_Borel_space EoM]). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.

Every Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra,}} is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.

A [[w:Measure space|measure space]] is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the [[w:Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measure]] is a measure space. [[w:Lebesgue integration|Integration theory]] defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.

Sets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a "mod&amp;nbsp;0 isomorphism" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).

A [[w:Probability space|probability space]] is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, [[w:Gaussian measure|Gaussian measures]]), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.

[[w:Standard probability space|Standard probability spaces]] are [[w:Standard probability space#Using the standardness|especially useful]]. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure ([[w:Standard probability space#Regular conditional probabilities|regular conditional probabilities]], see also [[w:Disintegration theorem|disintegration of measure]]). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Measure_algebra_(measure_theory) measure algebras] is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod&amp;nbsp;0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.

These spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.

===Non-commutative geometry===

The theoretical study of calculus, known as [[w:Mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]], led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions.  The earliest examples of these were [[w:Function space|function spaces]], each one adapted to its own class of problems.  These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces.  These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.

The most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called [[w:Banach algebra|Banach algebras]].  These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation.  An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space ''X''.  This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication.  With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative [[w:von Neumann algebra|von Neumann algebra]].  Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on ''X''.  An early observation of [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.

Von Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do.  Together with [[w:Francis Joseph Murray|Francis Murray]], he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras.  The [[w:direct integral|direct integral]] construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called ''factors''.  Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types.  Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case.  Types II and III exhibited new phenomena.  A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer.  Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.

A slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors.  This approach is the theory of {{nowrap|[[w:C*-algebra|C*-algebras]].}}  Here, the motivating example is the {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space.  By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on ''X'' that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication.  The [[w:Gelfand–Naimark theorem|Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] implied that there is a correspondence between commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} and geometric objects: Every commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} is of the form &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; for some locally compact Hausdorff space ''X''.  Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras.}}  Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras:}} If there were such a thing as a "non-commutative space ''X''," then its &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; would be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}}; if in addition the Gelfand–Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as {{nowrap|C*-algebras;}} so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is ''defined'' to be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra.}}  Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of {{nowrap|C*-algebras,}} and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}}.

Both of these examples are now cases of a field called [[w:noncommutative geometry|non-commutative geometry]].  The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively.  Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity.  Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions.  For example, consider the non-periodic [[w:Penrose tiling|Penrose tilings]] of the plane by kites and darts.  It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often.  As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion.  This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense.  Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra,}} and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry.  Another example, and one of great interest within [[w:differential geometry|differential geometry]], comes from [[w:foliation|foliations]] of manifolds.  These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called ''leaves'', each of which is locally parallel to others nearby.  The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space.  However, the example of an [[w:irrational rotation|irrational rotation]] shows that this topological space can be inacessible to the techniques of classical measure theory.  However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.

===Schemes===
[[File:Spaces schemes etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: schemes, stacks etc]]

[[w:Algebraic geometry|Algebraic geometry]] studies the geometric properties of [[w:polynomial|polynomial]] equations.  Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.  Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.

Prior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space.  The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of [[w:Perspective (geometry)|perspective]], and its algebra is described by [[w:homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous polynomials]].  All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space.  Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials.  At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero.  The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.

[[w:André Weil|André Weil]] saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite.  In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing ''abstract algebraic varieties'' which were not embedded in projective space.  These are now simply called ''varieties''.

The type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties.  It was introduced by [[w:Alexander Grothendieck|Alexander Grothendieck]] and is called a [[w:scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid.  This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations.  For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously.  However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line.  The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration—a single point on a circle—is not expressive enough to determine a unique line.  Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.

One of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space.  Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a [[w:sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] on the topological space, called the "structure sheaf".  On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called "regular functions".  The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.

Like manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space.  In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space.  For a scheme, the local models are called [[w:affine scheme|affine schemes]].  Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and [[w:commutative algebra|commutative algebra]].  The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are [[w:commutative ring|commutative rings]].  If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} R&lt;/math&gt; which translates the algebraic structure of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; into geometry.  Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf.  These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra.  By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.

There are many schemes that are not affine.  In particular,  projective spaces satisfy a condition called [[w:proper morphism|properness]] which is analogous to compactness.  Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces).  Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.{{sfn|Eisenbud|Harris|2000}}

Several generalizations of schemes have been introduced.  [[w:Michael Artin|Michael Artin]] defined an [[w:algebraic space|algebraic space]] as the quotient of a scheme by the [[w:equivalence relation|equivalence relations]] that define [[w:étale morphism|étale morphisms]].  Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible.  For instance, the [[w:Keel–Mori theorem|Keel–Mori theorem]] can be used to show that many [[w:moduli space|moduli spaces]] are algebraic spaces.

More general than an algebraic space is a [[w:Deligne–Mumford stack|Deligne–Mumford stack]].  DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials.  They play the same role for schemes that [[w:orbifold|orbifolds]] do for [[w:manifold|manifolds]].  For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne–Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space.  Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle.  But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point.  In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient.  This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe [[w:moduli of algebraic curves|moduli of algebraic curves]].

A further generalization are the [[w:algebraic stack|algebraic stacks]], also called Artin stacks.  DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions.  While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.

===Topoi===
[[File:Spaces topoi etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: locales, topoi etc]]

In Grothendieck's work on the [[w:Weil conjectures|Weil conjectures]], he introduced a new type of topology now called a [[w:Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topology]].  A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of "nearness," making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets.  By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of "covering".  A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space.  Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.

Grothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of [[w:topos (mathematics)|topoi]].  In his memoir ''Récoltes et Semailles'', he called them his "most vast conception".&lt;ref&gt;"Si le thème des schémas est comme le coeur de la géométrie nouvelle, le thème du topos en est l’enveloppe, ou la demeure. Il est ce que j’ai conçu de plus vaste, pour saisir avec finesse, par un même langage riche en résonances géométriques, une "essence" commune à des situations des plus éloignées les unes des autres, provenant de telle région ou de telle autre du vaste univers des choses mathématiques." ''Récoltes et Semailles'', page P43.&lt;/ref&gt; A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data.  The [[w:category (mathematics)|category]] of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data.  Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space.  Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right.  These are now called [[w:Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck topoi]].

Every topological space determines a topos, and vice versa.  There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological.  (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a [[w:sober space|sober space]].)  Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos.  But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest.  For instance, Grothendieck's theory of [[w:étale cohomology|étale cohomology]] (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the étale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.

Topological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called [[w:locale (mathematics)|locales]].  The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a [[w:lattice (order)|lattice]].  The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be [[w:complete Heyting algebra|complete Heyting algebras]].  The theory of locales takes this as its starting point.  A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms.  The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces.  Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called [[w:pointless topology|pointless topology]].

Topoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic.  Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier.  This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values.  In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to "False" and "True".  But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated.  [[w:William Lawvere|Lawvere]] and [[w:Myles Tierney|Tierney]] recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an [[w:elementary topos|elementary topos]], and that elementary topoi were models of [[w:intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic logic]].  In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.

==Spaces and structures==

According to Kevin Carlson,
:Neither of these words ["space" and "structure"] have a single mathematical definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same situations, but you often think of a "space" as more geometric and a "structure" as more algebraic. [...] So you could think of "structures" as places we do algebra, and "spaces" as places we do geometry. Then a lot of great mathematics has come from passing from structures to spaces and vice versa, as when we look at the [[w:Fundamental group|fundamental group]] of a topological space or the [[w:Spectrum of a ring|spectrum of a ring]]. But in the end, the distinction is neither hard nor fast and only goes so far: many things are obviously both structures and spaces, some things are not obviously either, and some people might well disagree with everything I've said here.&lt;ref name="carlson" /&gt;

Nevertheless, a general definition of "structure" was proposed by Bourbaki&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;; it embraces all [[#Types_of_spaces|types of spaces]] mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Robert C.|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1081878080 |title=Leo Corry, ''Modern Algebra and the Rise of Mathematical Structures''|department=Review|journal=Modern Logic|date=2000|volume=8|issue=1–2|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a book by Leo Corry:
:Corry does not seem to feel that ''any'' formal definition of structure could do justice to the use of the concept in actual mathematical practice [...] Corry's view could be summarized as the belief that 'structure' refers essentially to a way of ''doing'' mathematics, and is therefore a concept probably just as far from being precisely definable as the cultural artifact of mathematics itself.

For more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: [[w:Mathematical structure|mathematical structure]], [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures|equivalent definitions of mathematical structures]], and [[w:Transport of structure|transport of structure]].

The distinction between geometric "spaces" and algebraic "structures" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, [[w:Group (mathematics)|groups]] are algebraic, while [[w:Euclidean space|Euclidean spaces]] are geometric. [[w:Module (mathematics)|Modules]] over [[w:Ring (mathematics)|rings]] are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the [[w:Field (mathematics)#Constructing fields from rings|ring appears to be a field]], the [[w:Vector space#Modules|module appears to be a linear space]]; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and [[w:Inner product space|endowed with inner product]], it [[w:Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|becomes Euclidean space]]; now geometric. The (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of real numbers]] is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:real line|real line]]. Its [[w:Algebraic closure#Examples|algebraic closure]], the (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of complex numbers]], is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:Complex plane|complex plane]]. It is first of all "a place we do [[w:Complex analysis|analysis]]" (rather than algebra or geometry).

Every space treated in Section "[[#Types_of_spaces|Types of spaces]]" above, except for "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections, is a set (the "principal base set" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called "points" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called "points".

However, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be [[w:Projective geometry#Whitehead's axioms|formalized via two base sets]], the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, [[w:Duality (projective geometry)|a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines]]. A less geometric example: a graph may be [[w:Graph (discrete mathematics)#Graph|formalized via two base sets]], the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures#Transport of structures; isomorphism|finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets]] are stipulated by Bourbaki.

Many mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, "[[w:Pointless topology|pointless topology]]" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also [[w:Mereotopology|mereotopology]] and [[w:Whitehead's point-free geometry|point-free geometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">In [[mathematics]], a '''strong topology''' is a [[topology]] which is stronger than some other "default" topology. This term is used to describe different topologies depending on context, and it may refer to:

* the [[final topology]] on the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]]
* the topology arising from a [[normed vector space|norm]]
* the [[strong operator topology]]
* the [[strong topology (polar topology)]], which subsumes all topologies above.

A topology τ is stronger than a topology σ (is a [[Comparison of topologies|finer topology]]) if τ contains all the open sets of σ.

In [[algebraic geometry]], it usually means the topology of an [[algebraic variety]] as [[complex manifold]] or subspace of [[complex projective space]], as opposed to the [[Zariski topology]] (which is rarely even a [[Hausdorff space]]).

'''''The Whetstone of Witte''''' is the shortened title of [[Robert Recorde]]'s [[mathematics]] book published in 1557, the full title being '''''The whetstone of witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmetike: containyng thextraction of Rootes: The ''Coßike'' practise, with the rule of ''Equation'': and the woorkes of ''Surde Nombers'''. The book covers topics including whole numbers, the extraction of roots and irrational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/978-0-85729-862-1_10|title=Robert Recorde: Tudor Polymath, Expositor and Practitioner of Computation|series=History of Computing|first=Jack|last=Williams|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9780857298621|contribution=The Whetstone of Witte|pages=173–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is notable for containing the first recorded use of the [[equals sign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Galileo's Finger:The Ten Great Ideas of Science|first=Peter|last=Atkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780191622502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJyXzvkXWBAC&amp;pg=PT484|page=484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also for being the first book in English to use the [[plus and minus signs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Cosimo|year=2007|isbn=9781602066847|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhEh8jPGQOcC&amp;pg=PA164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime factor exponent notation|Recordian notation]] for [[exponentiation]], however, differed from the later Cartesian notation &lt;math&gt;p^q = p \times p \times p \cdots \times p&lt;/math&gt;.  Recorde expressed [[exponent|indices]] and [[Nth root|surds]] larger than 3 in a systematic form based on the [[prime factorization]] of the exponent: a factor of two he termed a ''zenzic'', and a factor of three, a ''cubic''. Recorde termed the larger prime numbers appearing in this factorization ''sursolids'', distinguishing between them by use of ordinal numbers: that is, he defined 5 as the ''first sursolid'', written as '''ʃz''' and 7 as the ''second sursolid'', written as '''Bʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also devised symbols for these factors: a zenzic was denoted by '''z''', and a cubic by '''&amp;'''.  For instance, he referred to ''p&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zzz''' (the [[zenzizenzizenzic]]), and ''q&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;=q&lt;sup&gt;2×2×3&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zz&amp;''' (the zenzizenzicubic).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the book he includes a chart of exponents all the way up to ''p&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2x2x5&lt;/sup&gt;'' written as '''zzzzʃz'''. There is an error in the chart, however, writing ''p&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''Sʃz''', despite it not being a prime. It should be ''p&lt;sup&gt;3x23&lt;/sup&gt;'' or '''&amp;Gʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

1748: Italian mathematician [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi|Maria Agnesi]] published the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus, called ''Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana''.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Dirk Jan Struik]], Agnesi is "the first important woman mathematician since [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] (fifth century A.D.)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenesys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigenesys.eu/index.php/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/665-maria-gaetana-agnesi|title=Epigenesys - Maria Gaetana Agnesi &amp;#124; Women in science|publisher=epigenesys.eu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1759: French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work ''Principia Mathematica'' was published posthumously; it is still considered the standard French translation.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/emilie_du_chatelet.php|title=Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Emilie du Chatelet|publisher=brooklynmuseum.org|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1827: French mathematician [[Sophie Germain]] saw her theorem, known as [[Sophie Germain's theorem|Germain's Theorem]], published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/germain.htm|title=Sophie Germain|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/UGpages/sophie.html|title=Sophie Germain page|publisher=math.rochester.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theorem Germain proved that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are integers and if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; then either ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' must be divisible by&amp;nbsp;5. Germain's theorem was a major step toward proving [[Fermat's last theorem]] for the case where n equals 5.&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"/&gt;

1829: The first public examination of an American girl in [[geometry]] was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4kEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=the+first+public+examination+of+a+girl+in+geometry+(1829)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iP5ShzK5u-&amp;sig=sBOKjFQxaCHgVm10oM2EE4g1BNg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U-iYTdm4D-GS0QHBpZj6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA# |title=History of Woman Suffrage: 1848–1861, Volume 1|page= 36|editor1=Elizabeth Cady Stanton |editor2=Susan B.

1874: Russian mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] became the first woman in modern Europe to gain a doctorate in mathematics, which she earned from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/323006/Sofya-Vasilyevna-Kovalevskaya|title=Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian mathematician) -- Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1880: [[Charlotte Angas Scott]] of Britain obtained special permission to take the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] Exam, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam. She came eighth on the Tripos of all students taking them, but due to her sex, the title of "eighth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]," a high honour, went officially to a male student.&lt;ref name=kenschaft&gt;{{cite book|title="Charlotte Angas Scott (1858–1931)" in Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook|year=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-24849-4|pages=193–203|author=Patricia Clark Kenschaft|authorlink=Patricia Clark Kenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony, however, after the seventh wrangler had been announced, all the students in the audience shouted her name. Because she could not attend the award ceremony, Scott celebrated her accomplishment at Girton College where there were cheers and clapping at dinner, and a special evening ceremony where the students sang "See the Conquering Hero Comes", and she received an ode written by a staff member, and was crowned with laurels.&lt;ref name=kenschaft /&gt; 

1886: [[Winifred Edgerton Merrill]] became the first American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics, which she earned from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400504p.pdf |title=Winifred Edgerton Merrill : "She Opened the Door" |publisher=Ams.org |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1888: The [[Kovalevskaya top]], one of a brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion, was discovered by [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Kovalevskaya, Sur Le Probleme De La Rotation D'Un Corps Solide Autour D'Un Point Fixe, Acta Mathematica 12 (1889) 177–232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[E. T. Whittaker]], A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, Cambridge University Press (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

1913: American mathematician [[Mildred Sanderson]] published her theorem about modular invariants in her thesis. It states: “To any modular invariant i of a system of forms under any group G of linear transformations with coefficients in the GF[pn], there corresponds a formal invariant I under G such that I = i for all sets of values in the field of the coefficients of the system of forms.” She was [[Leonard Dickson]]’s first female graduate student, and he later wrote of her thesis, “This paper is a highly important contribution to this field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.” [[E.T. Bell]] wrote, “Miss Sanderson’s single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.”&lt;ref name="agnesscott2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/sander.htm|title=Mildred Leonora Sanderson|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umbilic torus.png|thumb|right]]
The '''umbilic torus''' or '''umbilic bracelet''' is a single-edged 3-dimensional shape. The lone edge goes three times around the ring before returning to the starting point. The shape also has a single external face. A [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of the surface forms a [[Deltoid curve|deltoid]].

The umbilic torus occurs in the mathematical subject of [[singularity theory]], in particular in the classification of [[umbilical point]]s which are determined by real [[cubic form]]s &lt;math&gt;a x^3 + 3 b x^2 y + 3 c x y^2 + d y^3&lt;/math&gt;. The equivalence classes of such cubics form a three-dimensional real projective space and the subset of parabolic forms define a surface – the umbilic torus. [[Christopher Zeeman]] named this set the umbilic bracelet in 1976.&lt;ref name=port&gt;{{Citation|first=Ian R.|last=Porteous|title=Geometric Differentiation, For the Intelligence of Curves and Surfaces|ISBN=978-0-521-00264-6|pp=350
|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press| edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torus is defined by the following set of [[parametric equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Roland E., et al. ''Calculus''. Ed. Charles Hartford. 6th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sin u \left(7+\cos\left({u \over 3} - 2v\right) + 2\cos\left({u \over3} + v\right)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

[[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] created a sculpture ''Eternity'' based on the shape in 1989, this had a triangular cross-section rather than a deltoid of a true Umbilic bracelet. This appeared on the cover of Geometric Differentiation by [[Ian R. Porteous]].&lt;ref name="port"/&gt;

[[Helaman Ferguson]] has created a 27-inch (69 centimeters) bronze sculpture, ''Umbilic Torus'', and it is his most widely known piece of art. In 2010, it was announced that [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] had commissioned an Umbilic Torus sculpture to be constructed outside the Math and Physics buildings at [[Stony Brook University]], in proximity to the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]]. The torus is made out of cast bronze, and is mounted on a stainless steel column. The total weight of the sculpture is 65 tonnes, and has a height of {{convert|28|ft|m}}. The torus has a diameter of {{convert|24|ft|m}}, the same diameter as the granite base. Various mathematical formulas defining the torus are inscribed on the base. Installation was completed in September, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Helaman Ferguson, "Two Theorems, Two Sculptures, Two Posters", ''American Mathematical Monthly'', Volume 97, Number 7,August-September 1990, pages 589-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Univariate''' is a term commonly used in statistics to describe a type of data which consists of observations on only a single characteristic or attribute. A simple example of univariate data would be the salaries of workers in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kachigan|first1=Sam Kash|title=Statistical analysis : an interdisciplinary introduction to univariate &amp; multivariate methods|date=1986|publisher=Radius Press|location=New York|isbn=0-942154-99-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the other data, univariate data can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools after the data is measured, collected, reported, and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacke|first1=Prem S. Mann ; with the help of Christopher Jay|title=Introductory statistics.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-44466-5|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Univariate data types ==
Some univariate data consists of numbers (such as the height of 65 inches or the weight of 100 pounds), while others are nonnumerical (such as eye colors of brown or blue). Generally, the terms [[categorical data|categorical]] univariate data and [[numerical data|numerical]] univariate data are used to distinguish between these types.

=== Categorical univariate data ===
Categorical univariate data consist non-numerical [[observation]]s that may be placed in categories. It includes labels or names used to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical univariate data usually use either [[nominal number|nominal]] or [[ordinal number|ordinal]] [[scale of measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David R.|last2=Sweeney|first2=Dennis J.|last3=Williams|first3=Thomas A.|title=Statistics For Business &amp; Economics|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-80926-8|pages=1018|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numerical univariate data ===
Numerical univariate data consist observations that are numbers. They are obtained using either [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or [[ratio]] scale of measurement. This type of univariate data can be classified even further into two subcategories: [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]] and [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacke|first1=Prem S. Mann; with the help of Christopher Jay|title=Introductory statistics.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-44466-5|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; A numerical univariate data is discrete if the set of all possible values is [[finite set|finite]] or countably [[infinite set|infinite]]. Discrete univariate data are usually associated with counting (such as the number of books read by a person). A numerical univariate data is continuous if the set of all possible values is an interval of numbers. Continuous univariate data are usually associated with measuring (such as the weights of people).

== Data analysis and applications ==
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. '''Uni''' means '''one''', so in other words the data has only one variable.&lt;ref name=stathow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticshowto.com/univariate/|title=Univariate analysis|website=stathow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Univariate data requires to analyze each [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] separately. Data is gathered for the purpose of answering a question, or more specifically, a research question. Univariate data does not answer research questions about relationships between variables, but rather it is used to describe one characteristic or attribute that varies from observation to observation.&lt;ref name=study.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/univariate-data-definition-analysis-examples.html|title=Univariate Data|website=study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually there are two purposes that a researcher can look for. The first one is to answer a research question with descriptive study and the second one is to get knowledge about how [[Variable and attribute (research)|attribute]] varies with individual effect of a variable in [[Regression analysis]]. There are some ways to describe patterns found in univariate data which include graphical methods, measures of central tendency and measures of variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Descriptive Statistics|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/statdesc.php|website=Web Center for Social Research Methods|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graphical methods===
The most frequently used graphical illustrations for univariate data are:

==== Frequency distribution tables  ====
Frequency is how many times a number occurs. The frequency of an observation in statistics tells us the number of times the observation occurs in the data. For example, in the following list of numbers {''1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9, 8, 5, 1, 1, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9''}, the frequency of the number 9 is 5 (because it occurs 5 times).

==== Bar charts ====
[[File:Barplot.jpg|thumb|This is an example of barplot.]]
Bar chart is a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] consisting of [[rectangular]] bars. There bars actually represents [[number]] or percentage of observations of existing categories in a variable. The [[length]] or [[height]] of bars gives a visual representation of the proportional differences among categories.

==== Histograms ====
[[File:Histarman2.jpg|thumb|histogram]]
[[Histograms]] are used to estimate distribution of the data, with the frequency of values assigned to a value range called a [[Data binning|bin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diez|first1=David M.|last2=Barr|first2=Christopher D.|last3=Çetinkaya-Rundel|first3=Mine|title=OpenIntro Statistics|date=2015|publisher=OpenIntro, Inc.|isbn=978-1-9434-5003-9|page=30|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pie charts ====
Pie chart is a circle divided into portions that represent the relative frequencies or percentages of a population or a sample belonging to different categories.

=== Measures of central tendency ===
Central tendency is one of the most common numerical descriptive measures. It's used to estimate the central location of the univariate data by the calculation of [[mean]], [[median]] and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stepanski|first1=Norm O'Rourke, Larry Hatcher, Edward J.|title=A step-by-step approach to using SAS for univariate &amp; multivariate statistics|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=1-59047-417-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these calculation has its own advantages and limitations.The mean has the advantage that its calculation includes each value of the data set, but it is particularly susceptible to the influence of [[outlier]]s. The median is a better measure when the data set contains [[outlier]]s. The mode is simple to locate. The important thing is that it's not restricted to using only one of these measure of central tendency. If the data being analyzed is categorical, then the only measure of central tendency that can be used is the mode. However, if the data is numerical in nature ([[ordinal number|ordinal]] or [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]/[[ratio]]) then the mode, median, or mean can all be used to describe the data. Using more than one of these measures provides a more accurate descriptive summary of central tendency for the univariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longnecker|first1=R. Lyman Ott, Michael|title=An introduction to statistical methods and data analysis|date=2009|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Pacific Grove, Calif.|isbn=978-0-495-10914-3|edition=6th ed., International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures of variability ===
A measure of [[Statistical variability|variability]] or [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] (deviation from the mean) of a univariate data set can reveal the shape of a univariate data distribution more sufficiently. It will provide some information about the variation among data values. The measures of variability together with the measures of central tendency give a better picture of the data than the measures of central tendency alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Data Analysis A Practical Guide.|last2=Militky|first2=Jirí|date=2011|publisher=Woodhead Pub Ltd|isbn=978-0-85709-109-3|location=New Delhi|last1=Meloun|first1=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most frequently used measures of variability are [[range (mathematics)|range]], [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics|date=2007|publisher=Norton|isbn=0-393-92972-8|edition=4.|location=New York [u.a.]|last1=Purves|first1=David Freedman ; Robert Pisani ; Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of each measure would depend on the type of data, the shape of the distribution of data and which measure of central tendency are being used. If the data is categorical, then there is no measure of variability to report. For data that is numerical, all three measures are possible. If the distribution of data is symmetrical, then the measures of variability are usually the variance and standard deviation. However, if the data are [[Skewness|skewed]], then the measure of variability that would be appropriate for that data set is the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David R.|last2=Sweeney|first2=Dennis J.|last3=Williams|first3=Thomas A.|title=Statistics For Business &amp; Economics|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-80926-8|pages=1018|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Univariate distributions ==
[[Univariate distribution]] is a dispersal type of a single random variable described either with a [[probability mass function]] (pmf) for [[discrete probability distribution]], or [[probability density function]] (pdf) for [[continuous probability distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Samaniego|first1=Francisco J.|title=Stochastic modeling and mathematical statistics : a text for statisticians and quantitative scientists|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4665-6046-8|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with [[multivariate distribution]].

===Common discrete distributions===
[[Uniform distribution (discrete)]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Bernoulli distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Binomial distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Geometric distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Negative binomial distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Poisson distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Hypergeometric distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Zeta distribution]]

===Common continuous distributions===
[[Uniform distribution (continuous)]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Normal distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Gamma distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Exponential distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Weibull distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Cauchy distribution]] &lt;br&gt;

'''Utpala''' or '''{{IAST|Bhaṭṭotpala}}''' (''{{IAST|[[Bhaṭṭa]]-utpala}}'') is the name of a 10th-century Indian commentator of [[Vārāha Mihira]]'s ''[[Brihat Samhitā]]''. ''Brihat Samhitā'' is a Samhitā text of {{IAST|[[Jyotiṣa]]}} (Indian astrology and astronomy) . Samhitā is one of three branches of {{IAST|Jyotiṣa}} (Samhitā has many other meanings outside {{IAST|Jyotiṣa}}).

He is known for quoting six verses from ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' which are not found in its extant version. These six verses can be found in the 'Introduction' by S.Jain to the translation of Surya Siddhānta made by E. Burgess.&lt;ref&gt;Many publishers have published this translation of ''Surya Siddhānta'' by Burgess which was originally published in 1858. Orient Book Centre of Delhi published this translation of Surya Siddhānta by Burgess edited by S. Jain who wrote an introduction 50 pages long.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the author of a commentary on [[Brahmagupta]]'s ''{{IAST|Khaṇḍa-khādyaka}}'' (7th century). In this, he is a successor of [[Prthudaka]] and a predecessor of [[Amaraja]].

He was from [[Kashmiri people|Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Bina Chatterjee (introduction by), ''The Khandakhadyaka of Brahmagupta'', Motilal Banarsidass (1970), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lallanji Gopal, ''History of Agriculture in India, Up to C. 1200 A.D.'', Concept Publishing Company (2008), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kosla Vepa, ''Astronomical Dating of Events &amp; Select Vignettes from Indian History'', Indic Studies Foundation (2008), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dwijendra Narayan Jha]] (edited by), ''The feudal order: state, society, and ideology in early medieval India'', Manohar Publishers &amp; Distributors (2000), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
In Sanskrit, the neuter noun ''utpala'' has two meanings, both given by ''[[Amarakosha|{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}]]'' (a lexicon of circa. 400 AD). The first meaning is ''white lotus'' also known as ''kuvalaya'' in Sanskrit, according to  {{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}'' 1.10.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For electronic edition of Amarakoṣa definition see: [http://www.ms.uky.edu/~sohum/amar/amar1.itx].&lt;/ref&gt; The second meaning of ''utpala'' is a variety of medicinal plant known as '{{IAST|kooṭh}}' in Hindi and '{{IAST|kusṭham}}, vyādhi, paribhavyam or pāribhavyam, vāpyam, pākalam' according to {{IAST|Amarkośa}}.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Amarakoṣa}}'' 2.4.126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For electronic edition of Amarakoṣa definition see: [http://www.ms.uky.edu/~sohum/amar/amar2.itx].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monier-Williams]] gives following meanings of ''utpala'': (1) the blossom of the blue lotus ''[[Nymphaea caerulea]]'' (-Mahābhārata, Rāmāyana, Suśruta, Raghuvamsa, Meghdoota, etc.),(2) a seed of  ''Nymphaea caerulea'' (-Suśruta), (3) the plant ''[[Costus speciosus]]'' (-Bhagavata Purāna), (4) any water-lily, any flower, (-lexicons) (5) a particular hell (-Buddhist literature), (6) name of a Nāga, (7) names of several persons, including an astronomer, (8) its feminine form ''utpalā'' meant a river (-Harivamśa), (9) its feminine form ''utpalā'' also meant a kind of cake made of unwinnowed corn (-lexicons);

An unrelated homonym, compounded from ''ud'' "apart" + ''pala'' "flesh" means 'fleshless, emaciated' (-lexicons) and is the name of a particular hell (-lexicons).

'''Utpala''' is a kind of [[flower]] which is usually appeared in the Thangka of [[Tibet]]an. It rises from [[mud]], and is like [[water]] [[lily]] or [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]. Utpala is a [[symbol]] of the [[Virtue|pure]]. Several [[traditional]] deities of [[Tibet]] including Tārā have been depicted holding Utpala flowers in hands. Tārā is a famous deity in Buddhism and is also worshipped by Shakti-worshipping Hindus as well esp. in Eastern India,e.g., [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]].

[[Image:Wythoffian construction diagram.png|480px|thumb|Example Wythoff construction triangles with the 7 generator points. Lines to the active mirrors are colored red, yellow, and blue with the 3 nodes opposite them as associated by the Wythoff symbol.]]
[[Image:Wythoff construction-pqr.png|400px|thumb|The eight forms for the Wythoff constructions from a general triangle (p q r).]]

In [[geometry]], the '''Wythoff symbol''' represents a [[Wythoff construction]] of a [[uniform polyhedron]] or plane tiling,  from a [[Schwarz triangle]]. It was first used by [[Coxeter]], Longuet-Higgins and Miller in their enumeration of the uniform polyhedra.

A Wythoff symbol consists of three numbers and a vertical bar. It represents one uniform polyhedron or tiling, although the same tiling/polyhedron can have different Wythoff symbols from different symmetry generators. For example, the regular [[cube]] can be represented by &lt;math&gt;3\ |\ 4\ 2&lt;/math&gt; with [[Octahedral symmetry|O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]], and &lt;math&gt;2\ 4\ |\ 2&lt;/math&gt; as a square [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with 2 colors and [[Dihedral symmetry|D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]], as well as &lt;math&gt;2\ 2\ 2\ |&lt;/math&gt; with 3 colors and &lt;math&gt;D_{2h}&lt;/math&gt; symmetry.

With a slight extension, Wythoff's symbol can be applied to all uniform polyhedra. However, the construction methods do not lead to all uniform tilings in Euclidean or hyperbolic space.

== Description ==
In three dimensions, Wythoff's construction begins by choosing a ''generator point'' on the triangle. If the distance of this point from each of the sides is non-zero, the point must be chosen to be an equal distance from each edge. A perpendicular line is then dropped between the generator point and every face that it does not lie on.

The three numbers in Wythoff's symbol, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, represent the corners of the Schwarz triangle used in the construction, which are &lt;math&gt;\pi/p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi/q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi/r&lt;/math&gt; [[radians]] respectively. The triangle is also represented with the same numbers, written &lt;math&gt;(p\ \ q\ \ r)&lt;/math&gt;. The vertical bar in the symbol specifies a categorical position of the generator point within the fundamental triangle according to the following:
*&lt;math&gt;p\ |\ q\ r&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the generator lies on the corner &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;p\ q\ |\ r&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the generator lies on the edge between &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;p\ q\ r\ |&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the generator lies in the interior of the triangle.
In this notation the mirrors are labeled by the reflection-order of the opposite vertex. The &lt;math&gt;p, q, r&lt;/math&gt; values are listed ''before'' the bar if the corresponding mirror is active.

The one ''impossible'' symbol &lt;math&gt;|\ p\ q\ r&lt;/math&gt; implies the generator point is on all mirrors, which is only possible if the triangle is degenerate, reduced to a point. This unused symbol is therefore arbitrarily reassigned to represent the case where all mirrors are active, but odd-numbered reflected images are ignored. The resulting figure has rotational symmetry only.

The generator point can either be on or off each mirror, activated or not. This distinction creates 8 (2³) possible forms, neglecting one where the generator point is on all the mirrors.

The Wythoff symbol is functionally similar to the more general [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]], in which each node represents a mirror and the arcs between them – marked with numbers – the angles between the mirrors.  (An arc representing a right angle is omitted.)  A node is circled if the generator point is not on the mirror.

== Summary table ==
There are seven generator points with each set of &lt;math&gt;p, q, r&lt;/math&gt; (and a few special forms):

There are three special cases:
* &lt;math&gt;p\ q\ (r\ s)\ |&lt;/math&gt; – This is a mixture of &lt;math&gt;p\ q\ r\ |&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\ q\ s\ |&lt;/math&gt;, containing only the faces shared by both.
* &lt;math&gt;|\ p\ q\ r&lt;/math&gt; – Snub forms (alternated) are given by this otherwise unused symbol.
* &lt;math&gt;|\ p\ q\ r\ s&lt;/math&gt; – A unique snub form for [[Great dirhombicosidodecahedron|U75]] that isn't Wythoff-constructible.

== Symmetry triangles ==

There are 4 symmetry classes of reflection on the [[sphere]], and three in the [[Euclidean plane]]. A few of the [[List of regular polytopes#Hyperbolic tilings|infinitely many]] such patterns in the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] are also listed.  (Increasing any of the numbers defining a hyperbolic or Euclidean tiling makes another hyperbolic tiling.)

Point groups:
* (p 2 2) [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral symmetry]], &lt;math&gt;p = 2, 3, 4 \dots &lt;/math&gt; (order &lt;math&gt;4p&lt;/math&gt;)
* (3 3 2) [[tetrahedral symmetry]] (order 24)
* (4 3 2) [[octahedral symmetry]] (order 48)
* (5 3 2) [[icosahedral symmetry]] (order 120)
Euclidean (affine) groups:
* (4 4 2) [[Square tiling|*442 symmetry]]: 45°-45°-90° triangle
* (6 3 2) *[[632 symmetry]]: 30°-60°-90° triangle
* (3 3 3) *[[triangular tiling|333 symmetry]]: 60°-60°-60° triangle
Hyperbolic groups:
* (7 3 2) *[[732 symmetry]]
* (8 3 2) *[[832 symmetry]]
* (4 3 3) *[[433 symmetry]]
* (4 4 3) *[[443 symmetry]]
* (4 4 4) *[[444 symmetry]]
* (5 4 2) *[[542 symmetry]]
* (6 4 2) *[[642 symmetry]]

In [[probability theory]], a '''zero–one law''' is a result that states that an event must have probability 0 or 1 and no intermediate value. Sometimes, the statement is that the limit of certain probabilities must be 0 or 1.

It may refer to: 
* [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]
* [[Blumenthal's zero–one law]] for [[Markov process]]es,
* [[Engelbert–Schmidt zero–one law]] for continuous, nondecreasing additive functionals of Brownian motion,
* [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]] for exchangeable sequences,
* [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]] for the tail σ-algebra,
* [[Lévy's zero–one law]], related to martingale convergence.
* [[topological zero–one law]] related to [[meager set]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">'''Δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''' ('''Delta P''') is a mathematical term used to illustrate a change (Δ) in pressure (&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Uses==
*[[Young–Laplace equation]]

===Darcy–Weisbach equation===
As used in the '''[[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]''' — Given that the [[head loss]] ''h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' expresses the [[pressure]] loss ''&amp;Delta;p'' as the height of a column of fluid,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h_f&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the density of the fluid, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of pressure loss:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho V^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Lung compliance===
In general, compliance is defined by the change in volume ([[ΔV]]) versus the associated change in pressure (ΔP), or [[ΔV/ΔP]]. During [[mechanical ventilation]], compliance can be influenced by 3 key physiologic factors:
#[[Lung compliance]]
#[[Chest wall compliance]]
#[[Airway resistance]]

Lung compliance is influenced by a variety of primary abnormalities of [[lung parenchyma]], both chronic and acute. [[Airway resistance]] is typically increased by [[bronchospasm]] and airway secretions. Chest wall compliance can be decreased by fixed abnormalities (e.g. [[kyphoscoliosis]], [[morbid obesity]]) or more variable problems driven by patient agitation while intubated.&lt;ref name="pmid21866369"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dellamonica J, Lerolle N, Sargentini C, Beduneau G, Di Marco F, Mercat A, etal | title=PEEP-induced changes in lung volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two methods to estimate alveolar recruitment. | journal=Intensive Care Med | year= 2011 | volume=  37| issue=  10| pages=  1595–604| pmid=21866369 | doi=10.1007/s00134-011-2333-y | pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating Compliance on [[minute volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;: [[ΔV]] is always defined by [[tidal volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), but ΔP is different for the measurement of dynamic vs. static compliance.

====Dynamic Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{dyn} = \frac{V_T}\mathrm{PIP-PEEP}&lt;/math&gt;

where PIP = [[peak inspiratory pressure]] (the maximum pressure during inspiration), and PEEP = [[positive end expiratory pressure]]. Alterations in airway resistance, [[lung compliance]] and chest wall compliance influence C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Static Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;stat&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{stat} = \frac{{V_T}}{{P_{plat}-PEEP}}&lt;/math&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; = plateau pressure. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is never &gt; PIP and is typically &lt; 3-5 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O lower than PIP when airway resistance is normal.
