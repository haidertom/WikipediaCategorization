      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25099">The non-existent '''Buenaventura River''', alternatively '''San Buenaventura River''', '''Río Buenaventura''', etc. was once believed to run from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] through the [[Great Basin]] region of what is now the western [[United States]]. The river was chronologically the last of several imagined incarnations of an imagined [[Great River of the West]] which would be for [[North America]] west of the Rockies what the [[Mississippi River]] was east of the Rockies. The hopes were to find a waterway from coast to coast, sparing the traveling around [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of [[South America]].&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;[[Miles Harvey]], ''The Island of Lost Maps: A True Story of Cartographic Crime'', p.&amp;nbsp;208&amp;ndash;215.

==Dominguez, Vélez de Escalante and Miera==
In 1776, two Franciscan missionaries Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante sought to find a land route between [[Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe]] in [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] to [[Monterey (California)|Monterey]] in [[Alta California]].{{efn |Both of these territories were then provinces of [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]].}} They were part of what has become known as the [[Dominguez–Escalante Expedition]], a ten-man expedition including [[Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco]] (Meira) acting as the cartographer.{{efn|They were joined en route by two Native American guides.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |last=Moody |first= Ralph| title=The Old Trails West|publisher=Thomas Y. Cromwell Company|location= New York|year= 1963 |page= 157ff|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Old_Trails_West.html?id=hLElAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} On September 13, they encountered what is now called the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], a southward-flowing [[tributary]] of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]] and named it ''San Buenaventura'' after  the catholic saint [[Bonaventure]].

[[Image:Miera map 1778.jpg|thumb|300px|Map by Barnardo de Miera, 1778, depicting the Buenaventura River as a faulty combination of [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] and [[Sevier River]].  The depiction of "Lake Timpanogos" with a narrow strait in the middle is probably a misunderstanding of the indigenes description of the large lake to the north (the [[Great Salt Lake]]) as directly connected to Utah Lake rather than connected by the 50 mile long [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]].  "Laguna de Miera" is the [[Sevier Lake]], again drawn from descriptions by the indigenes.]]

At that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante' journal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |title=The Diary and Itinerary of Fathers Domínguez and Escalante -- English Translation |work=Early Americas Digital Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928071254/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today's White River? – which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Escalante Journal, September 17&lt;/ref&gt; So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name.

The lake to the north, just west of the city of [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], is [[Utah Lake]].  The south tip of the Great Salt Lake can be seen at the top of the map.]]
After establishing contact with a branch of the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called [[Lake Timpanogos]] (various spellings), now called "[[Utah Lake]]," the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the [[Sevier River]]) flowing from the south-southeast and turning toward the west at the point they encountered it. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream-the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake ([[Sevier Lake]]) and beyond.  The Sevier Lake has no outlet, the indigenes may have been referencing the west-flowing [[Humboldt River]] which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Dale L. |title=Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NuoINGBjQIC |publisher=Bison Book University of Nebraska Books |location= Lincoln, London |origyear=1953|year=1964 |ISBN=0-8032-5138-6|edition=paperback|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante's doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depicts the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake{{efn|Why Meira disregarded the evidence the two rivers were not the same is a mystery. He was often ill and suffered terribly in the cold returning to Santa Fe,&lt;ref&gt;http://newmexicohistory.org/people/bernardo-de-miera-y-pacheco&lt;/ref&gt; and that may have affected his memory, causing him to disagree with the padrés journal.}} in west-central Utah.{{efn|The lake is called "Lago Salado de Teguayo" ("Teguayo" itself being a legendary region thought to exist in the general area the expedition was exploring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geographicus.com/blog/rare-and-antique-maps/teguayo-great-salt-lake-and-atzlatan/&lt;/ref&gt;) in the case of a 1777 map attributed to "Antonio Vélez y Escalante"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Derrotero hecho por Antonia Vélez y Escalante, misionero para mejor conocimiento de las misiones, pueblos de indios y presidios que se hallan en el Camino de Monterrey a Santa Fe de Nuebo Mexico|website=Library of Congress|date=1777|accessdate=December 27, 2015|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/96686648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bears Miera's name, in the case of the versions attributed to him, of which there are several in various collections.}} In an accompanying note to king Charles III of Spain, Miera recommended building several missions in the area and mentioned the possibility of a water way to the Pacific Ocean, via the Buenaventura or the Timpanogos River; the river Miera depicts on his map as flowing west from the Great Salt Lake (GSL).  Although Miera documented a correct description of the GSL given to them by the indigenes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francaviglia |first=Richard V.| title=Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin: A Cartographic History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExTf_VDTKiMC |year=2005| location=Reno |publisher=University of Nevada Press |page=37|isbn=0-87417-609-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish assumed that what they thought had been described was incorrect and interpreted their description of the "extremely salty" lake as the ocean&lt;ref name=Cline&gt;{{cite book|last=Cline |first=Gloria Griffen | title=Exploring the Great Basin|publisher=University of Nevada Press |location=Reno|date=1988|edition=paperback|origyear=1963|isbn=0-87417-134-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed the description of the river flowing from "Lake Timpanogos" which is the Jordan River flowing between Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, as a waterway to the Pacific.

The error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalanté expedition to prepare his maps in 1804&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=von Humboldt|first=Alexander|website= Library of Congress| title=General chart of the kingdom of New Spain betn. parallels of 16 &amp; 380 N. from materials in Mexico at commencement of year of 1804 |date=1804|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2001622416/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=von Humboldt |first=Alexander |title=Carte Generale Du Royaume De La Nouvelle Espagne |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~1866~170004 |date=1809|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Zebulon Pike]] used Humboldts maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Pike |first=Zebulon Montgomery |title=Map of The Internal Provinces of New Spain |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~930~60171 |date=1810|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Arrowsmith]] in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to "Lac Sale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arrowsmith|first=Aaron |website= Library of Congress| title=A map exhibiting all the new discoveries in the interior parts of North America. |date=1814|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3300.ct001203//}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante.

==Extending the Buenaventura West to the Pacific==

[[File:San Joaquin River watershed.png|thumb|Watershed map of the San Joaquin River, depicting its head in the Sierra Nevada]]
There had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage.{{efn|A map by [[Robert Sayer]] (1750?)&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3300.np000059&lt;/ref&gt; shows the Great River of the West flowing from Lake Winnipeg}}  When [[Francisco Garcés]] drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and he drew the "San Felipe" or [[San Joaquin River]] heading (originating) beyond the Sierras in the [[Great Basin]] to the Pacific Ocean, in or near [[San Francisco Bay]]. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]  (1784), they extended the "San Felipe" almost to the Sevier Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, op. cit. pp. 52-3&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar map was published in 1820 by [[Sidney Edwards Morse|Sidney E. Morse]] showing the Rio de San Buenaventura flowing into a lake, the western limits of which are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morse |first=Sidney Edward|title=United States|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~29366~1130411:United-States-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:4494003;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 |website=David Rumsey Maps|date=1820|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This map shows the "Supposed river between the Buenaventura and the Bay of Francisco, which will probably be the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific" toward this lake, but quite not connecting with it.{{efn| By 1828, however, Morse was leaving the "supposed river" off his map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morse |first=Sidney Edward|title=United States|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~28288~1120297:United-States-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:0627004;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 |website=David Rumsey Maps|date=1828|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A map by J. Finlayson (1822) shows a Rio de S. Buenaventura originating near the "{{sic|Principle}} source of the Rio Colorado" and emptying into a salt lake the western limits of which "are unknown". This same map indicates that an uncharted Rio de San Filipe crosses a range of mountains at 122 degrees west longitude.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Other cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and "Lac Salado" to the Pacific Ocean.  [[Henry Schenck Tanner|Henry S. Tanner]]'s influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=North America...S.W.

Timpanogos), the other to [[Port Orford]], Oregon (the Los Mongos R.) where the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] enters the Pacific.  A similar map by Anthony Finley was published in 1826&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Finley |first=Anthony |title= Map of North America Including All The Recent Geographical Discoveries. 1826|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~2354~250001:Map-of-North-America-Including-All-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:finley%2B1826;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=6&amp;trs=205 |date=1826|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|By 1830, Finley had dropped the two northern rivers and just depicted the Buenaventura flowing from the "Salt Lake" (Sevier Lake)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Finley |first=Anthony |title=Mexico |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~490~60032 |date=1830|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  A map by Thomas Bradford (1835) shows a river flowing to San Francisco Bay (mislabeled Sir Francis Drake) from the south end of Lake Timpanogos. There is no reference to Rio de San Buenaventura.   An 1844 map by James Bowden shows a landlocked Buenaventura wrapping around the southeast side of a "doubtful" Lake Timpanogos.

==Explorations to find the Buenaventura==

The Great Salt Lake (GSL) was first seen and reported as very saline by white North Americans in 1824, apparently independently by [[Jim Bridger]] and [[Etienne Provost]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. pp. 182-83&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of the GSL, explorers began equating Lake Timpanogos on the maps with it, and apparently unaware of the fact that [[Inland sea (geology)|saline lakes]] such as the Great Salt and Sevier Lakes have no outlets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stegner|first=Wallace |title=Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-q4BPeGQ0jcC |publisher=Penguin |origyear=1982|date=March 1, 1992|isbn=1101075856 |page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; began efforts to find the rivers flowing from them west to the Pacific as promised by maps such as Tanner's.

In 1825, [[William Henry Ashley|William H. Ashley]] attempted to float the Green (Buenaventura) River to either what was called "Salt Lake" (actually Sevier Lake) on Tanner's map, or the [[Colorado River]], to which the fur traders suspected it flowed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  He started in present-day [[Wyoming]], and after passing through the treacherous [[Gates of Lodore]], aborted the trip prior to entering [[Desolation Canyon]].  Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL.  The next spring his partner, [[Jedediah Smith]], explored areas the north and west of the GSL, but found no rivers flowing from it.  He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were also unsuccessful in finding the "Los Mongos R." and "R. Timpanogos". However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the "R. Timpanogos" as "R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=Mexico &amp; Guatemala |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~567~60205 |date=1836|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, when, in 1841, [[John Bidwell]] embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bidwell |first=John|website=longcamp.com|editor=Bob Graham |url=http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |date=1890|title=Quotes from Frèmont et. al. on His Search for the Buenaventura}} from {{cite journal |journal=The Century; a popular quarterly|title=Gold Hunters of California.

After Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura.  In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake.  Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further.  He encountered the Sevier River on its northeast-flowing stretch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jedediah S.|last2=Rogers |first2=Harrison G. |editor=George R.

In the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer.  He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet.

The Buenaventura River's existence or non-existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when [[John Charles Frémont]], with Thomas Fitzpatrick and [[Kit Carson]] as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the [[Columbia River]] to [[Sacramento, California]] via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker River]], he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html Excerpts] from Frémont's journals. Accessed online 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon later finding the [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] flowed into the Pacific at about the same point the maps depicted the mouth of the Buenaventura, Frémont concluded that it was the source of the legend and applied the name "Rio San Buenaventura" to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frémont|first=John Charles |website= Library of Congress|title=Map of an exploring expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the year 1842 and to Oregon &amp; north California in the years 1843-44 |date=1845|accessdate=January 2, 2016|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/96688042/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frèmont |first=John Charles|website=longcamp.com|editor=Bob Graham |url=http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html |accessdate= November 10, 2008 |date=1891|title=Quotes from Frèmont on His Search for the Buenaventura}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|As late as 1849,&lt;ref&gt;Hollingsworth's "Sketch of General Riley's Route"&lt;/ref&gt; the name "Buenaventura River" was applied to the Salinas River.}}

After Frémont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, [[James K. Polk|President Polk]] was reluctant to accept his conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Frémont, op, cit.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Frémont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], directed their ambitions to a [[transcontinental railway]], which was completed in 1869, after the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48 and the [[American Civil War]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">The '''Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing''' ('''CSTARS''') is a [[ground station]] that receives [[imagery]] data from a variety of [[remote sensing]] [[satellites]].  CSTARS is owned and operated by the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], a college within the [[University of Miami]].

[[File:CSTARS_logo.jpg|256px|right|thumb]]

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf "Research Notes" eVeritas]&lt;/ref&gt; This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].&lt;ref name=dhs/&gt;

CSTARS is located on the Richmond campus of the [[University of Miami]] at {{Coord|25.6137|-80.384|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility CSTARS Site Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708041603/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ==
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ==
The United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] has included CSTARS as one of its "Centers of Excellence" so that CSTARS will work with the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] to research [[port]] security and maritime [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] issues.&lt;ref name=dhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|title=University of Miami’s CSTARS To Form Part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Center of Excellence for Maritime Security|work=Press Release|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf CSTARS: PROTECTING OUR PORTS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003309/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf |date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Office of Naval Research (ONR) ==
The [[Office of Naval Research]] awarded CSTARS a grant to support satellite based research studies on internal [[Swell (ocean)|waves]] and [[typhoons]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,2593-1;65847-3,00.html A Wave of Support for Satellite Research]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031615/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1%2C1770%2C2593-1%3B65847-3%2C00.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Palau ==
CSTARS participated in a [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] study to examine how to protect one of the largest Marine Protected (MPA) areas in the world through the utilization of commercially available earth imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/05/palau_monitoring_control_and_surveillance.pdf ''The Republic of Palau Exclusive Economic Zone MONITORING, CONTROL, AND SURVEILLANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Official Municipality Key''', formerly also known as the Official Municipality Characteristic Number or Municipality Code Number, is a number sequence for the identification of politically independent [[municipality|municipalities]] or [[unincorporated area]]s.  Other classifications for the identification of areas include [[postal code]]s, [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] codes or [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] codes.

See [[Code officiel géographique]].

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]] the Official Municipality Key serves [[statistics|statistical]] purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German [[States of Germany|states]].  The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents.  This is done at the registration office in every town's [[city hall (administration)|city hall]].

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first two numbers'''}} designate the individual German state.  The {{color|blue|'''third digit'''}} designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead).  The {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts).  The {{color|purple|'''sixth, seventh, and eighth digits'''}} indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====
{{color|red|'''08'''}} {{color|blue|'''1'''}} {{color|green|'''11'''}} {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: [[Stuttgart]]

* {{color|red|'''08'''}}: [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* {{color|blue|'''1'''}}: Government district of Stuttgart
* {{color|green|'''11'''}}: Urban area of Stuttgart
* {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: No other municipality is available, since Stuttgart is an urban area

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or {{va|PSGC code}}, the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, {{nowrap|1=mm = city / municipality}} code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of [[Ubay, Bohol]] has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying "not at this level." [[Bongbong]], one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

== Sweden ==
A '''kommunkod''' (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] by the Swedish tax authorities.  The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which [[counties of Sweden|county]] the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with [[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns ([[köping]]) 60 to 79 and [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]] 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

'''Distances Between Ports''' (PUB 151) is a publication that lists the distances between major ports. Reciprocal distances between two ports may differ due to the different routes of currents and climatic conditions chosen. To reduce the number of listings
needed, junction points along major routes are used to consolidate routes converging from different directions.

This book can be most effectively used for [[passage planning|voyage planning]] in conjunction with the proper volume(s) of the [[Sailing Directions|Sailing Directions (Planning Guide)]]. It is corrected via the [[Notice to Mariners]].

The positions listed for ports are central positions that most represent each port. The distances are between positions shown for each port and are generally over routes that afford the safest passage. Most of the distances represent the shortest navigable routes, but in some cases, longer routes, that take advantage of favorable currents, have been used. In other cases, increased distances result from routes selected to avoid ice or other dangers to navigation, or to follow required separation schemes.

'''Diver navigation''', termed "underwater navigation" by [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]],&lt;ref name = UKDivers/&gt; is a set of techniques—including observing natural features, the use of a compass, and surface observations—that divers use to  [[Navigation|navigate]] [[underwater]]. [[Free-diving|Free-divers]] do not spend enough time underwater for navigation to be important, and [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied divers]] are limited in the distance they can travel by the length of their [[Surface-supplied diving#Diver's umbilical|umbilicals]] and are usually directed from the surface control point. On those occasions when they need to navigate they can use the same methods used by scuba divers.

Although it is considered a basic skill, it is normally only taught to a limited degree as part of basic Open Water certification.  Most North American [[List of diver certification organizations|diver training agencies]] only teach significant elements of underwater navigation as part of the [[Advanced Open Water Diver]] certification program.

Underwater navigation is usually a core component of most, if not all, advanced recreational diver training.  In the [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] Advanced Open Water Diver course, it is one of the two mandatory skills (together with [[Deep diving]]) which must be taken alongside three elective skills.&lt;ref name="PADI" /&gt;

Training agencies promote underwater navigation as a skill (despite the fact that it is less popular than other [[Recreational diving#Specialties|recreational diving specialties]]){{cn|date=October 2017}} on the basis that it:
* builds diver confidence
* saves energy by minimising excess swimming
* makes dive planning more effective
* keeps [[buddy diving|dive buddies]] together
* reduces air consumption

Underwater compass navigation is a component of the [[scuba diving|scuba-based]] [[underwater sports|underwater sport]], [[underwater orienteering]].&lt;ref name="CMAS-ori" /&gt;

==Navigation techniques==

Underwater navigation in [[recreational diving]] is broadly split into two categories.  ''Natural navigation'' techniques, and ''orienteering'', which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater [[compass|magnetic compass]].&lt;ref name=Cumming2011 /&gt;

Natural navigation, sometimes known as [[pilotage]], involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise.  Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.&lt;ref name=UKDivers&gt;

Orienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically dependent on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an [[impeller log]], to pacing off the distance along the bottom with the arms.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Many skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Navigation using natural features===

====Landmarks====
{{Main|Piloting (navigation)}}
Recognisable topographical features may be remembered or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility is sufficient to see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, [[shot line]]s, [[Diving equipment#Special equipment for underwater work not carried by the diver|jackstay]]s and [[guide line]]s.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Depth and depth variation====
The slope of the bottom is often a reliable indicator of the direction toward the shore, particularly when the bottom is of soft or loose material, and is not broken up greatly by rocky outcrops. This information can be checked for reliability on a sufficiently detailed chart of the area. Contours of depth running roughly parallel to the coastline indicate a slope dipping directly away from the shore, and can be used to maintain a sense of distance and orientation relative to the shore. In some places where the bottom is composed of predominantly rocky outcrops the slope may be in any direction and is not a reliable indicator of direction.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Angle of the sun, changes in light level====
If circumstances of depth and water clarity allow the position of the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, the depth fairly shallow and the surface fairly smooth.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

In some circumstances the diver can look up at the surface, to see in which direction the land lies. These cues will not give any precise information about position, but will allow the diver to keep a mental picture of where he or she is and is going.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Current, wave and surge direction====
[[Ocean current|Current]] direction can be useful as an orientation cue as long as the direction of the current is known. In rivers it tends to be fairly consistent and reliable, though localised eddies may occur. In the sea it may depend on weather conditions and local topography, as well as the state of the [[tide]]. In estuaries and harbours the currents will usually be predominantly tidal, so the state of the tide must be known, as the difference in direction between ebb and flow is usually about 180°.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

[[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#surge|Wave surge]] direction is essentially the same as wave direction, but may be felt at depths where the wave direction is no longer visible. It is useful if the offshore wave direction relative to the shore is known and does not change appreciably during the dive. In shallow water the wave crests will often be parallel to the shore. The important difference is that waves can be seen to travel in a definite direction, whereas surge is a back and forth motion, allowing a possible 180° error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Ripple patterns on a sand bottom====
A regular and distinct ripple pattern on a sand, mud or gravel bottom is an indication that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a ripple pattern on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the ripple pattern. When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests. Ripple crests, like surge, may be interpreted with a 180° error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Dip and strike of bedrock====
Many rock formations have characteristic angles known as [[Strike and dip|dip and strike]]. Dip is the slope of the strata from the horizontal, and strike is the general direction of the strata in the horizontal plane (very roughly). These characteristics will usually be similar in the rocks above and below the water in a locality, so they can be used to estimate direction. Ridges above and below water are often parallel, and gullies and valleys may well extend under water for considerable distances.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Ecological variations====
Different areas may for a wide variety of reasons have different ecologies. A diver who is familiar with an area can use the diversity variations and patterns to provide orientation cues.

There is often variation of [[ecological zone|ecological zoning]] with depth, but a diver is expected to be aware of the depth all the time anyway. In some places the seaward side of big rocks may have different species from the shoreward face because of the greater exposure to wave action.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

[[Sea fans]] and [[sponges]] are [[filter feeders]], and may grow into a fan shape at right angles to the usual current or surge direction, to get the maximum volume of water flowing past them.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Compass navigation===

====How a compass works====
The [[magnetic compass]] indicates the local direction of the ambient [[magnetic field]], which is usually that of the Earth. This is usually a reliable and consistent feature and is very useful as a navigational aid as it is not affected by visibility, pressure, or the presence of water.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

An important concept is that the compass card should not turn, even though it appears to always “swing” to magnetic north. The housing that holds the compass card turns around the card, which remains pointing in the same direction ([[Magnetic North]]) all the time.  There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====True or geographic north====
[[True north]] is the geometrically accurate direction along the surface of the earth toward the North pole of the planet’s axis of rotation.
The lines of [[longitude]] on maps are in true North/South directions.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Magnetic north and variation====
The Earth has a magnetic field which is not quite in line with the geographic directions. The difference between the magnetic and true directions is known as [[Magnetic variation|Variation]]. It differs from place to place and changes with time. Large scale charts and maps will usually include a [[compass rose]] showing variation.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Compass north and deviation====
The compass will indicate the magnetic field direction at the place where it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the [[Magnetosphere|Earth’s magnetic field]], these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called [[magnetic deviation|deviation]], and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any [[ferromagnetic|magnetic]] object or [[electrical current]] will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a [[dive computer]] is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive compass for deviation caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, [[steel]] [[Scuba tank|cylinders]] can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A [[diver propulsion vehicle]] with an [[electric motor]] is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navogate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Deviation may be checked by comparing the compass bearing as measured with a known magnetic bearing measured by a compass with no deviation. Deviation may vary with different directions and for accurate work it is necessary to make up a table of deviations. This is done for ships, but for diving it is generally not worth the trouble. Bearings of one diver's compass may vary from those of another diver even if they have both been read correctly. The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Dip====
The magnetic field of the earth is tilted from the horizontal. The angle is called [[magnetic dip|dip]] and varies with place, so compasses can be corrected for different zones. This is a factory process. A compass made for the northern parts of the northern hemisphere will tilt badly in the southern hemisphere, in some cases to the extent that it will jam if held horizontal.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Guidelines===
{{main article|Distance line}}
[[File:Cave diver running a reel.jpg|thumb|right|A cave diver running a distance line into the overhead environment to facilitate a safe exit]]
Also known as cave lines, distance lines, penetration lines and jackstays. These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks and other areas where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious.&lt;ref name="Exley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guideline 2" /&gt; Guidelines are also useful in the event of [[silt out]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 3" /&gt;

Distance lines are wound on to a spool or a [[reel]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 1" /&gt; The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a [[surface marker buoy]] may only need 50 metres / 165 feet, whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15&amp;nbsp;m) to 1000+&amp;nbsp;ft (300&amp;nbsp;m).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Reels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy [[surface marker buoy]]s and [[decompression buoy]]s and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a [[Diving shot|shotline]] or boat anchor.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, [[nylon]] being the material of choice for cave diving.&lt;ref name="Guideline 1"/&gt; A common line used is 2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;inch) [[polypropylene]] line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.&lt;ref name="Guideline 3"/&gt;

====Line markers====
{{main article|Line marker}}
[[Image:Line arrow.jpg|thumb|alt= |A line arrow on a cave's main guideline pointing to the exit]]
[[File:Cave diving line markers secure.svg|thumb|alt= |Illustration showing typical cave line markers and how they are attached to the line for security.
{{bulleted list

In [[cave diving|cave]] (and occasionally wreck) diving, '''line markers''' are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a "jump" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility. Non-directional markers ("cookies") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt;

===Direction by surface control personnel===
In some circumstances divers may be directed by their surface control personnel. This requires a method of [[Diver communications|communication]] between the surface team and the diver.
Both [[Diver communications#Voice communications|voice]] communications and [[Diver communications#Rope signals|line signals]] may be used to direct the movement of the diver and to provide other information.
Surface direction may be used in scuba diving when [[Ice diving|diving under ice]] or conducting an [[Underwater searches#Searches directed from the surface|underwater search]], and in [[surface supplied diving]] for both these purposes and at any other time that it is useful or convenient for the dive controller to direct the movement of the diver. Surface direction is most useful when the surface personnel have a better idea of where the diver is relative to where he or she needs to be than the diver has, which can happen when the visibility is poor, or when the diver is following a search pattern controlled by the surface controller.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

==Surface navigation for diving==
[[File:Cocked hat on chart.jpg|thumb|Cocked hat on chart showing navigational error]]
Surface applications for compass navigation include marking a position and finding the position using compass bearings. At least two position lines are required to fix a position, as only direction can be found using a compass. When two bearings are used a large angle between the bearings will minimize error. The angle should preferably be between 60 and 120 degrees, and near 90 degrees would be ideal. Three bearings are better as they will also give an indication of probable accuracy when plotted on a chart. The "cocked hat" or triangle where the lines intersect, shows the probable location of the position measured, and a small triangle indicates a small probable error. The angle between the three bearings should preferably be in the order of 60 or 120 degrees where available landmarks allow. In all cases landmarks should be as close to the diver as possible and spread over a large arc for best accuracy.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

==Equipment==

Various pieces of equipment are available to assist divers navigating underwater.
* [[Magnetic compass]]es, set either in a diver's console or wrist mounted.  Various forms exist.
* Scuba sextant, or Nav-finder, to enable a diver to plot an ongoing course during a dive.
* Compass boards
* Hand-held sonar
* Cave and wreck reels and line
* Jump spools
Periodically reports are issued suggesting the development of underwater [[Global positioning system|GPS]] technology, but no system is currently available on market.  It is generally thought that the difficulty of locating satellite by signals from underwater at present is not capable of being overcome by existing technology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Construction====

The typical diving compass is made from a card with graduation in degrees, mounted on a pivot in a transparent housing filled with fluid which damps the movement and prevents pressure collapse of the housing. It may be wrist mounted, console mounted or carried some other way. It is desirable that the compass can operate accurately at significant tilt angles without sticking.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

On the card there is a magnet which will interact with the ambient magnetic field so as to align itself and the card with the field provided it is free to rotate. There will be other marks on the housing which are intended to be aligned with the direction of travel of the user, so the offset of the card to the housing will indicate the direction of the magnetic field and the orientation of the user.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Important features of a diving compass are that it can easily be read in dim light, the card or needle does not easily jam if the housing is tilted slightly, and that it can be securely attached to the diver's arm or equipment and does not get lost. It is useful for any straps to be adjustable while wearing gloves, and any clips that may attached should be non-magnetic.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The strap should be long enough to go round the diver's wrist over the diving suit glove, and if it is slightly elastic it will stay in place when the suit compresses.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

There may be a movable bezel which can be set to record a course and to help set a reciprocal course.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

There are also electronic compasses which can provide a digital or analogue display These are based on [[magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|magnetometer]] technology. Several models of [[dive computer]] incorporate a compass function, but this may not be accessible at the same time as the primary decompression information, and may be limited in their precision of display information.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Direct and Indirect reading compasses====
There are two ways in which a compass may be marked, which influence the way you would read them. These are known as direct reading compasses and indirect reading compasses. Both provide the same information to the same level of accuracy. Both types may have graduations on the card which can be read through a side window to give the bearing directly.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The '''direct reading compass''' has graduations on the housing which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero on the far side. 
The effect of this configuration is that if the housing is aligned with a direction, the north point of the card or needle will point directly towards the number representing the bearing. No further effort is needed on the part of the operator, you just find the number the arrow points at and read off the bearing. 
The bezel has no graduations, it is just a marker to align the card.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The '''indirect reading compass''' has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise round the face, and the zero mark coincides with the notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read at the far side of the compass.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Electronic compasses====

{{further|flux-gate compass|Dive computer}}
Flux-gate compasses are built into several models of dive computer as an extra function. They may require calibration when powered up, but calibration usually lasts as long as the processor is running. They are usually insensitive to tilt as there are no moving parts to jam. The display varies, and may not be as intuitive as for a mechanical compass needle or card arrangement. They can often be calibrated to account for local deviation and give true direction. The nearby presence of a magnetic compass can cause large error, but they are not greatly affected by other electronic compasses, as can be seen from the images.&lt;ref name="iX3M" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perdix" /&gt;

Some digital cameras for underwater use also have a built in flux-gate compass (such as the Olympus TG series) which can be used for navigation as well as for recording the direction of a photograph.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">'''Ex-meridian''' is a [[celestial navigation]] method of calculating an observer’s position on [[Earth]]. The method gives the observer a position line on which the observer is situated. It is usually used when the [[Sun]] is obscured at [[noon]], and as a result, a [[meridian altitude]] is not possible. The navigator measures the altitude of the Sun as close to noon as possible and then calculates where the position line lies.

==Methodology==
This method uses an assumed [[longitude]] and calculates the [[latitude]] that a position line crosses it. The position line obtained is actually part of a [[small circle]], as opposed to [[great circle]], where any observer can stand and the heavenly object would have the same altitude in the sky. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant.

The assumed longitude is usually obtained from the DR or Dead Reckoning position run up from a morning sight taken at around 9.00 am. This is worked out by applying the distance from that position either by log or by the estimated speed over time with the course steered. A sight is taken, that is the distance above the horizon of a heavenly object, in this case nearly always the sun, is measured with a [[sextant]] and the exact time noted in [[UTC]]. The sextant angle obtained is corrected for dip (the error caused by the observers height above the sea) and refraction to obtain the true altitude of the object above the horizon. This is then subtracted from 90° to obtain the angular distance from the position directly above, the zenith. This is referred to as the True Zenith Distance. The true zenith distance of the object is also the distance (in arc) on the Earth's surface from the observer to where that object is overhead, the geographical position of the object.

Using a [[nautical almanac]], the [[declination]] (celestial latitude), and the [[Greenwich]] [[hour angle]] (celestial longitude) are obtained of the observed object for the time of observation. The  assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the Greenwich Hour Angle of the object to obtain the local hour angle, that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.

With this information it is possible using the [[haversine]] formula to calculate the latitude where the position line crosses the assumed longitude. The formula is:

&lt;math&gt;hav(MZD) = hav(TZD) - hav(LHA) cos(Lat) cos(Dec)&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;MZD&lt;/math&gt; = Meridian Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;TZD&lt;/math&gt; = True Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;LHA&lt;/math&gt; = Local Hour Angle

&lt;math&gt;Lat&lt;/math&gt; = DR Latitude

&lt;math&gt;Dec&lt;/math&gt; = Declination

Once the value of the [[meridian (astronomy)|Meridian]] Zenith Distance is obtained the algebraic sum of it with the declination of the object gives the latitude of a point where the position line crosses the meridian of DR longitude.

To draw the position line on a chart the [[azimuth]] or bearing of the heavenly object must be known. It is usually calculated but could have been observed. A line at right angles to the azimuth is drawn through the calculated position which is where the calculated latitude and the DR longitude cross. The observer is somewhere on this line.

To obtain a fix (a position) this line must be crossed with another position line either from another sight or from elsewhere. In the case of ex-meridian the position line is usually crossed with the position line obtained earlier which has been run up.

==Ex-Meridian Tables==
The first of these tables applies corrections to the altitude taken with the argument of ''Change of Altitude in one minute from Meridian Passage''. Two other tables apply more corrections until the correct latitude is arrived at. 

== Accuracy and Versatility ==
The Ex-Meridian method of calculating sights is at its most accurate when the azimuth of the object is near to south or north. As the azimuth changes towards the east or west the cross of the position line with the assumed longitude becomes more and more oblique and the position obtained is therefore less accurate. For this reason it is a less versatile method of calculating sights than the [[intercept method]] which can be used for all azimuths. The tables are a quick and easy way to correct the altitude when the object is fairly low in the sky and the observer has only missed noon by a few minutes but if noon has been missed by more than that or the sun is high in the sky it is better to work out a sight by the intercept method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

'''Frederick Albert Cook''' (June 10, 1865&amp;nbsp;– August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician, and [[ethnographer]], noted for his claim of having reached the [[North Pole]] on April 21, 1908. This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts were disputed for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009, pp. 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition did discover [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic|American Arctic]] by a United States expedition.

In December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching [[Denali|Mount McKinley]]'s summit has also been discredited.

== Biography ==
Cook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon, New York]], but he was actually born in [[Hortonville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 1997, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting the phonetic version of their surname. He attended [[Columbia University]] and received his doctorate from [[New York University Medical School]] in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Early expeditions ===
Cook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship—the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}—was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.

In 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]], with whom Bridges had worked for two decades, during which time he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.&lt;ref name="parson"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf "Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work"]. ''New York Times'', May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount McKinley summit ===
[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of McKinley's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]
In 1903, he led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] during which he circumnavigated the Denali range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's McKinley ascent was also fraudulent.

Contrary to [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], 19 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf "An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit denying that they had reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he was paid by Peary supporters to do so. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 129. note 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what became called [[Fake Peak]], featured in Cook's "summit" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climber [[Bradford Washburn]] has gathered data, repeated the climbs, and taken new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's "summit" photograph;&lt;ref&gt;Compare rock-by-rock the left side of Cook's 1906 "summit" photo to the corresponding parts of the 1957 photo by Adams Carter and Bradford Washburn. Photos juxtaposed in Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 116. Compare also the background features in Cook's "summit" photo versus those in his own photo taken a few minutes later (towards the same direction) from the top of Fake Peak: Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). figure 4 versus figure 18; detailed-blowup comparisons in figures 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos were taken past the "Gateway" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and 3 miles below its top.

An expedition by the Mazama Club in 1910 reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still 10 miles distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last 10 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (3). pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dishonorable Dr. Cook: Debunking the Notorious Mount McKinley Hoax | first = Bradford | last = Washburn | authorlink = Bradford Washburn |author2=Peter Cherici | year = 2001 | location = Seattle | publisher = Mountaineers Books | oclc = 47054650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (2005) p.282&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1970s, climber [[Hans Waale]] found a route which fit Cook's narrative and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf Bryce (1997) ''DIO''] p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shparo.com/Cook/Cook_main.htm "Following the traces of Dr. Frederick Cook"], SH Paro&lt;/ref&gt;

No evidence of Cook's purported journey between the "Gateway" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce. (1997). ''DIO'' pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; nor by his compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map or camp trash. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Pole ===
[[File:Frederick Cook's 1909 arctic expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo allegedly taken at, or near, the North Pole]]
After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the [[Arctic]] in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 22, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.

Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.

There are striking similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization. For details, see Osczevski (2003).

Cook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').

[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]
Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey 700 miles south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the USA on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.

On December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | format=PDF | accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)

Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; These have an incorrect solar diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins (1972). ''[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]''. Oslo University. '''26'''. pp. 135–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.

The Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had only traveled a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). "Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole". ''Arctic''. '''56''' (2). pp. 207–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A genuine Cook discovery, Meighen Island, is the only island discovered by a United States expedition in the American arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mvmn Discoveries: "Meighen Island"], DIOI&lt;/ref&gt; For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).

The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his [[South Pole]] expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.

At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: "I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision."

== Reputation ==
Cook's reputation never recovered. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to see how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and set them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref name="ringle"/&gt; He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook "genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration-mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge-and that of the world-for its own sake."&lt;ref name="ringle"&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: "''Cook &amp; Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain support for continued expeditions.

=== Fraud trial ===
In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and was put on trial. Joining him in the trial was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.

Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud, and, in November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Olien, R. (1989). "Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association". ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Cook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8247">In [[surveying]], '''free stationing''' (also known as '''resection''') is a method of determining a location of one unknown point in relation to known points.&lt;ref name="Free Stationing" /&gt; There is a zero point of reference called a [[Total station]]. The instrument can be freely positioned so that all survey points are at a suitable sight from the instrument. Setting up the [[Total station]] on a known point, often it is not possible to see all survey points. With the Total Station, [[Bearing (navigation)|bearings]] and distances are measured to at least two known points of a [[control network]]. This with a [[Mobile device|handheld computer ]] recorded data is related to local [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], defined by the [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Horizontal Circle]] of the total station. By a [[geometric transformation]], these polar coordinates are transformed to the coordinate system of the control network. Errors are distributed by [[least squares adjustment]]. The position and orientation of the Total Station in relation to where the [[Control network]] is established. 

==Comparison of methods==
* [[Angular resection]] and [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]: only bearings are measured to the known points. 
* [[Trilateration]]: only distances are measured to the known points.
* Free stationing and [[wikt:triangulateration|triangulateration]]: both bearings and distances are measured to the known points.

==Naming==
Because bearings and distances in a Resection (Free Stationing) are measured, the result may have a different mathematical solution. This method of a "Total station set up" has different names in other languages, e.g. German: [[:de:Freie Standpunktwahl]] (Free Stationing).&lt;ref name="Free Stationing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose, Advantage, and Objective of Resection Setup|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406432/SC_Purpose,%20advantage%20and%20objective%20of%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Resnik"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Resnik/Bill|title=Vermessungskunde fuer den Planungs-, Bau- und Umweltbereich|publisher=Wichmann|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-488-4|page=115|edition=3.|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Witte/Schmidt|title=Vermessungskunde und Grundlagen der Statistik fuer das Bauwesen|date=2006|publisher=Herbert Wichmann Verlag|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-435-8|pages=180, 515|edition=6.|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moeser"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moeser/Hoffmeister/Mueller/Schlemmer/Staiger/Wanninger|title=Handbuch Ingenieurgeodäsie - Grundlagen|date=2012|publisher=Wichmann|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-504-1|pages=461, 476|edition=4.|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/buecher/ivz/9783879072934_inhaltsverzeichnis_00.pdf|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming is also regulated by the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|German Institute for Standardization]] DIN 18 709.

==Different mathematical solution==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The axes and circles of a theodolite]][[Image:Examples of Polar Coordinates.svg|left|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or (3,60°). In blue, the point (4,210°).]]
By measuring bearings and distances, local [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] are recorded. The orientation of this local polar coordinate system is defined by the 0° [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Horizontal Circle]] of the [[Total station]] (polar axis L). The pole of this local polar coordinate system is the [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Vertical Axis]] (pole O) of the Total Stations. The polar coordinates (r,f) with the pole are transformed with a [[Surveying#Software|Surveying Software]] in a [[Data logger|data collector]] to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (x,y) of the known points and the coordinates for the position of the Total station are calculated.&lt;ref name=Kahmen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|title=Angewandte Geodaesie – Vermessungskunde –|date=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|isbn=978-3-11-018464-8|pages=281, 282, 519, 532, 613|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a resection (triangulation) measuring bearings only, there can be a problem with an infinite number of solutions called: "[[Snellius–Pothenot problem#The indeterminate case| danger circle]]" or "[[inscribed angle theorem]]".

==Design of the Backsight Point Configuration==
The back-sight points of the control network should cover and surround the stationing site. The position of the total station is not part of the area. This is the area where you want to measure with this station setup. Topographic points or stakeout points should not be measured outside this area. If measured outside this area, the errors in orientation will be extrapolated instead of being interpolated.&lt;ref name="BS Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Design of the Backsight Point Configuration|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406433/SC_Design%20of%20backsight%20point%20configuration%20in%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is possible to use only two known control points in a resection (free stationing), it is recommended to use three control points. There is no [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] for orientation, using two points only.&lt;ref name=Redundancy&gt;{{cite web|title=Problems in Resection Without Redundancy|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406436/SC_Problems%20in%20resection%20without%20redundancy.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using five or more points of the control network, there is only a slight improvement in the accuracy.&lt;ref name=Kahmen /&gt;&lt;ref name="BS Design" /&gt;

==Advantages==

* Choose the station point free for best visibility to all survey points
* Where there is no obstruction
* Where there is no traffic
* Where there is the highest safety for the observer and the instrument

Because of the range and accuracy of total stations, the method of a resection (free stationing) permits a great freedom of positioning the total station. For this reason, this method is one of the most used station set ups.&lt;ref name=Resnik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witte /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moeser /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahmen /&gt;

==Application==
[[File:PLANTA proceso.JPG|thumb|240px|Example of a Site plan.]]
With the calculated coordinates and orientation of the total station, it can be used to set out points in [[construction surveying]], [[machine guidance]], [[site plan]] or other [[Surveying#Types of surveys|types of surveys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous European Union" excluding member states such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geographical cluster''' is a localised [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]], usually an excess of something given the [[spatial distribution|distribution]] or variation of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is considered as an [[incidence rate]] that is unusual in that there is more of some variable than might be expected. Examples would include: a local excess disease rate, a crime hot spot, areas of high unemployment, [[accident blackspot]]s, unusually high positive residuals from a model, high concentrations of flora or fauna, physical features or events like earthquake epicenters etc... {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

Identifying these extreme regions may be useful in that there could be implicit geographical associations with other variables that can be identified and would be of interest. Pattern detection via the identification of such geographical clusters is a very simple and generic form of geographical analysis that has many applications in many different contexts. The emphasis is on localized clustering or patterning because this may well contain the most useful information.  {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

A geographical cluster is different from a high concentration as it is generally second order, involving the factoring in of the distribution of something else. {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

==Geographical cluster detection==
Identifying geographical clusters can be an important stage in a geographical analysis. Mapping the locations of unusual concentrations may help identify causes of these. Some techniques include the Geographical Analysis Machine and Besag and Newell's cluster detection method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotheringham|first1=A. Stewart|last2=Zhan|first2=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">'''Geographical segregation''' exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more [[population]]s are not [[wiktionary:homogenous|homogenous]] throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal [[species]], human [[gender]]s, followers of a certain [[religion]], people of different [[nationalities]], [[ethnic group]]s, etc.

In [[social geography]] segregation of [[ethnic group]]s, [[social class]]es and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the [[index of dissimilarity]]. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Massey |first=D. |last2=Denton |first2=N. |title=American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0674018206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies also highlight new local indices of segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.08.005 |pmid=26463550 |title=Patterns of local segregation: Do they matter for neighborhood crime? |journal=Social Science Research |volume=54 |pages=303–18 |year=2015 |last1=Krivo |first1=Lauren J |last2=Byron |first2=Reginald A |last3=Calder |first3=Catherine A |last4=Peterson |first4=Ruth D |last5=Browning |first5=Christopher R |last6=Kwan |first6=Mei-Po |last7=Lee |first7=Jae Yong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human geographical segregation==

Segregation, as a broad concept, has appeared in all parts of the world where people exist—in different contexts and times it takes on different forms, shaped by the physical and human environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segregation&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial concentration of [[population]] groups is not a new [[phenomenon]]. Since [[societies]] began to form there have been segregated inhabitants. Either segregated purposefully by force, or gradually over time, segregation was based on socio-economic, religious, educational, linguistic or ethnic grounds. Some groups choose to be segregated to strengthen social identity.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;https://www.un.org/ga/Istanbul+5/50.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="segregation.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segregation.ch/segregation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108131650/http://segregation.ch/segregation/ |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Legal segregation===
Segregation can be caused by [[legal]] frameworks, such as in the extreme example of apartheid in South Africa, and even Jewish ghettoization in Germany in the 20th century. Segregation can also happen slowly, stimulated by increased land and housing prices in certain neighborhoods, resulting in segregation of rich and poor in many urban cities.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Segregation can also be assigned arbitrarily. This can occur on a global scale, such as is seen in the [[Partition of India]], instances in [[Ireland]], and many other situations. Geographical boundaries were often put in place without much consideration for native peoples and natural geographic terrain and cultural limits that had long been in place.

In [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], segregation was very much a legal concept. Enforced by the government, Africans were discriminated against, and forced to comply with apartheid. Some of the [[legislation]] passed dealt with physical segregation in schools, land tenure, geographic segregation and state repression. These were very clearly legislative, but also in the case of most white South Africans, a [[social construct]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Scythe |first=N. C. |title=Early Apartheid: Race Laws in South Africa 1652–1836 |work=[[Master of Laws|LLM]] thesis, University of Witwatersrand |location=Johannesburg |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segregation can also be encouraged, using geographical boundaries, while not explicitly enforced. [[Public housing]] [[projects]], especially in the United States, have been criticized for this. Putting cheap housing in poor black neighborhoods encouraged local African-Americans to stay in the area, keeping other richer areas white by not building public housing there. This has been changing in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119220526/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |archivedate=2013-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social segregation===
Segregation can also be caused by social factors that become evident as they happen, but are not necessarily government sanctioned. This could be things like informal ghettos, or simply rich neighborhoods. In terms of land capital, over time in a given area, [[humans]] will settle down and buy or take land. Some privileged people will acquire better land (that is, more [[Arable land|arable]], proximate to potential [[Capital (economics)|capital]], more pleasing views). Demand for these nicer habitats drives up prices, and areas deemed “better” based solely on geography become inherently exclusionary in their population makeup.

[[West Point Grey]], an area of [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]], is in part rich because of the views offered of [[Downtown Vancouver]], the [[Gulf Islands]], and its location near the water and [[University of British Columbia]]. Wealthy people had the resources to pay for advantages, and subsequently drove up prices. Examples of this can be seen all over the world. Geographical segregation is not defined by the sightline of places, though. It also occurs around certain structures, or simply in areas that are specifically developed with an income bracket in mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westsiderealty.ca West Side Realty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another segregation term, the [[ghetto]], has been used in many different contexts over time, generally meaning any physical part of a [[city]] predominantly occupied by any particular group of people. It implies that the group may be looked down upon and segregated purposefully. This does not mean that all ghettos are built up communities and buildings specifically for a segregation purpose, although many are. In the case of the United States, segregation of the [[African-American]] community was to a degree due to [[white flight]] out of the cities, than forcing African-Americans to live in the downtown cores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jdowd/masseydenton-apartheid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gated communities===
[[Gated communities]] could be seen as a combination of both [[legal]] frameworks and [[social]] conventions regarding segregation. A gated community today is a controlled [[neighborhood]], inhabited by people with [[common interests]], such as safety, or class separation, but not necessarily of the same [[ethnicity]] or [[religion]]—it is distinct from an international community (in most cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Behind-the-urban-curtains/2005/03/03/1109700606439.html |title=Behind the urban curtains |date=March 4, 2005 |first=Matt |last=O'Sullivan |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gated communities are very controversial, as they can be seen as encouraging distinction and separation, and therefore superiority from those who do not live with the gates community.

===Voluntary segregation===
Voluntary segregation is almost as common an occurrence as involuntary segregation is. Often, immigrants coming to a new and foreign country will band together for mutual benefit, and to keep a sense of community in the new country. These can be called ethnic enclaves and can be formed by any community or people group.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portes |first=Alejandro |first2=Leif |last2=Jensen |title=Disproving the Enclave Hypothesis: Reply |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=418–420 |jstor=2096246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known groups are [[Chinatowns]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatownology.com/usa.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Italy]]s and ''[[barrio]]s''. These localized phenomena also come in the form of [[ethnoburb]]s, which are essentially the same concept as an ethnic enclave, but specifically located in suburbs, rather than the traditional downtowns, where Chinatowns and Little Italys are usually based.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13750">The '''intercept method''', also known as '''Marcq St. Hilaire method''', is an astronomical [[navigation]] method of calculating an observer's position on earth. It was originally called the ''azimuth intercept'' method because the process involves drawing a line which intercepts the [[azimuth]] line. This name was shortened to ''intercept'' method and the ''intercept distance'' was shortened to 'intercept'.

The method yields a line of position (LOP) on which the observer is situated. The intersection of two or more such lines will define the observer's position, called a "fix".  Sights may be taken at short intervals, usually during hours of twilight, or they may be taken at an interval of an hour or more (as in observing the Sun during the day).  In either case, the lines of position, if taken at different times, must be advanced or retired to correct for the movement of the ship during the interval between observations.  If observations are taken at short intervals, a few minutes at most, the corrected lines of position by convention yield a "fix".  If the lines of position must be advanced or retired by an hour or more, convention dictates that the result is referred to as a "running fix".

== Summary ==
The intercept method is based on the following principle.
The actual distance from the observer to the geographical position ('''GP''') of a celestial body (that is, the point where it is directly overhead) is "measured" using a [[sextant]]. The observer has already estimated his position by [[dead reckoning]] and calculated the distance from the estimated position to the body's GP; the difference between the "measured" and calculated distances is called the intercept.
[[Image:Diagram showing GP distance = ZD.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]
The diagram on the right shows why the zenith distance of a celestial body is equal to the angular distance of its GP from the observer's position.

The rays of light from a celestial body are assumed to be parallel (unless the observer is looking at the moon, which is too close for such a simplification). The angle at the centre of the Earth that the ray of light passing through the body's GP makes with the line running from the observer's [[zenith]] is the same as the zenith distance. This is because they are [[corresponding angles]]. In practice it is not necessary to use zenith distances, which are 90° minus altitude, as the calculations can be done using observed altitude and calculated altitude.

Taking a sight using the intercept method consists of the following process:
* Observe the altitude above the horizon '''Ho''' of a celestial body and note the time of the observation.
* Assume a certain geographical position (lat., lon.), it does not matter which one so long as it is within, say, 50 NM of the actual position (or even 100 NM would not introduce too much error). Compute the altitude '''Hc''' and azimuth '''Zn''' with which an observer situated at that assumed position would observe the body.
* If the actual observed altitude Ho is smaller than the computed altitude Hc this means the observer is farther away from the body than the observer at the assumed position, and vice versa. For each minute of arc the distance is one NM and the difference between Hc and Ho expressed in minutes of arc (which equal NM) is termed the "intercept". The navigator now has computed the intercept and azimuth of the body.
* On the chart he marks the assumed position '''AP''' and draws a line in the direction of the azimuth Zn. He then measures the intercept distance along this azimuth line, towards the body if Ho&gt;Hc and away from it if Ho&lt;Hc. At this new point he draws a perpendicular to the azimuth line and that is the line of position '''LOP''' at the moment of the observation.
* The reason that the chosen AP is not important (within limits) is that if a position closer to the body is chosen then Hc will be greater but the distance will be measured from the new AP which is closer to the body and the end resulting LOP will be the same.

==Methodology==
[[Image:Intercept Sight Reduction-00.png|thumb|304px|right|Diagram illustrating the intercept sight reduction process]]
Suitable bodies for celestial sights are selected, often using a Rude Star Finder.  Using a [[sextant]], an altitude is obtained of the sun, the moon, a star or a planet.  The name of the body and the precise time of the sight in [[UTC]] is recorded.  Then the sextant is read and the altitude (''Hs'') of the body is recorded.  Once all sights are taken and recorded, the navigator is ready to start the process of [[sight reduction]] and plotting.

The first step in sight reduction is to correct the sextant altitude for various errors and corrections.  The instrument may have an error, IC or index correction (See article on [[Sextant adjustment|adjusting a sextant]]).  Refraction by the atmosphere is corrected for with the aid of a table or calculation and the observer's height of eye above sea level results in a "dip" correction, (as the observer's eye is raised the horizon dips below the horizontal).  If the Sun or Moon was observed, a semidiameter correction is also applied to find the centre of the object.  The resulting value is "observed altitude" (''Ho'').

Next, using an accurate clock, the observed celestial object's geographic position (''GP'') is looked up in an almanac. That's the point on the Earth's surface directly below it (where the object is in the [[zenith]]). The latitude of the geographic position is called declination, and the longitude is usually called the [[hour angle]].

Next, the altitude and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP).  This involves resolving a spherical triangle.  Given the three magnitudes: local hour angle (''LHA''), observed body's declination (''dec''), and assumed latitude (''lat''), the altitude ''Hc'' and azimuth ''Zn'' must be computed. The local hour angle, ''LHA'', is the difference between the AP [[longitude]] and the hour angle of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.

The relevant formulas (derived using the [[spherical trigonometric identities]]) are:

: &lt;math&gt;\sin(Hc) = \sin(lat) \cdot \sin(dec) + \cos(lat) \cdot \cos(dec) \cdot \cos(LHA) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tan(Zn) = \frac{\sin(LHA)}{\sin(lat) \cdot \cos(LHA) - \cos(lat) \cdot \tan(dec)}&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively,

: &lt;math&gt;\cos(Zn) = \frac{\sin(dec) - \sin(lat) \cdot \sin(Hc)}{\cos(lat) \cdot \cos(Hc)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:''Hc'' = Computed altitude
:''Zn'' = Computed azimuth
:''lat'' = Latitude
:''dec'' = Declination
:''LHA'' = Local Hour Angle

These computations can be done easily using electronic calculators or computers but traditionally there were methods which used logarithm or haversine tables. Some of these methods were H.O. 211 (Ageton), Davies, [[haversine]], etc.  The relevant [[haversine formula]] for ''Hc'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hav}(\overline{Hc}) = \operatorname{hav}(LHA) \cdot cos(lat) \cdot cos(dec) + \operatorname{hav}(lat \pm dec) &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''{{overline|Hc}}'' is the zenith distance, or complement of ''Hc''.

''{{overline|Hc}}'' = 90° - ''Hc''.

The relevant formula for Zn is

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{hav}(Zn) = \frac{ \cos(lat - Hc) - \sin(dec)}{2 \cdot \cos(lat) \cdot \cos(Hc)}&lt;/math&gt;

When using such tables or a computer or scientific calculator, the navigation triangle is solved directly, so any assumed position can be used.  Often the dead reckoning DR position is used. This simplifies plotting and also reduces any slight error caused by plotting a segment of a circle as a straight line.

With the use of astral navigation for air navigation, faster methods needed to be developed and tables of precomputed triangles were developed.  When using precomputed sight reduction tables, selection of the assumed position is one of the trickier steps for the fledgling navigator to master.  Sight reduction tables provide solutions for navigation triangles of integral degree values.  When using precomputed sight reduction tables, such as H.O. 229, the assumed position must be selected to yield integer degree values for ''LHA'' (local hour angle) and latitude.  West longitudes are subtracted and east longitudes are added to ''GHA'' to derive ''LHA'', so AP's must be selected accordingly. When using precomputed sight reduction tables each observation and each body will require a different assumed position.

Professional navigators are divided in usage between sight reduction tables on the one hand, and handheld computers or scientific calculators on the other.  The methods are equally accurate.  It is simply a matter of personal preference which method is used. An experienced navigator can reduce a sight from start to finish in about 5 minutes using nautical tables or a scientific calculator.

The precise location of the assumed position has no great impact on the result, as long as it is reasonably close to the observer's actual position. An assumed position within 1 degree of arc of the observer's actual position is usually considered acceptable.

The calculated altitude (''Hc'') is compared to the observed altitude (''Ho'', sextant altitude (''Hs'') corrected for various errors).  The difference between ''Hc'' and ''Ho'' is called "intercept" and is the observer's distance from the assumed position.  The resulting line of position (''LOP'') is a small segment of the [[circle of equal altitude]], and is represented by a straight line perpendicular to the azimuth of the celestial body. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant.

Navigators use the memory aid "computed greater away" to determine whether the observer is farther from the body's geographic position (measure intercept from ''Hc'' away from the azimuth).  If the ''Hc'' is less than ''Ho'', then the observer is closer to the body's geographic position, and intercept is measured from the AP toward the azimuth direction.

The last step in the process is to plot the lines of position ''LOP'' and determine the vessel's location.  Each assumed position is plotted first.  Best practise is to then advance or retire the assumed positions to correct for vessel motion during the interval between sights.  Each LOP is then constructed from its associated AP by striking off the azimuth to the body, measuring intercept toward or away from the azimuth, and constructing the perpendicular line of position.

To obtain a fix (a position) this ''LOP'' must be crossed with another ''LOP'' either from another sight or from elsewhere e.g. a bearing of a point of land or crossing a depth contour such as the 200 metre depth line on a chart.

==Sights==
Until the age of satellite navigation ships usually took sights at dawn, during the forenoon, at noon (meridian transit of the Sun) and dusk. The morning and evening sights were taken during twilight while the [[horizon]] was visible and the stars, planets and/or moon were visible, at least through the telescope of a [[sextant]]. Two observations are always required to give a position accurate to within a mile under favourable conditions. Three are always sufficient.

==Running fix==
A fix is called a ''running fix'' when one or more of the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP advanced or retrieved over time.  In order to get a fix the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better.  This means the observations must have different azimuths.  During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not a fix as another LOP is needed.  What may be done is take a first sight which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second LOP.  Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields a ''running fix''.

Any sight can be advanced and used to obtain a ''running fix''. It may be that the navigator due to weather conditions could only obtain a single sight at dawn. The resulting LOP can then be advanced when, later in the morning, a Sun observation becomes possible.  The precision of a running fix depends on the error in distance and course so, naturally, a running fix tends to be less precise than an unqualified fix and the navigator must take into account his confidence in the exactitude of distance and course to estimate the resulting error in the running fix.

Determining a fix by crossing LOPs and advancing LOPs to get running fixes are not specific to the intercept method and can be used with any sight reduction method or with LOPs obtained by any other method (bearings, etc.).

The '''International Ice Patrol''' is an organization with the purpose of monitoring the presence of [[iceberg]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]s and reporting their movements for safety purposes. It is operated by [[United States Coast Guard]] but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/iip/2011_IIP_Annual_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was established in 1914 in response to the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']]. The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to alert any seacraft traveling the [[great circle]] shipping lanes between Europe and the major ports of the United States and Canada of the presence of any icebergs there. &lt;ref&gt;A.J.

==History==
=== Founding ===
From the earliest journeys into the [[North Atlantic]], icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]. For example, [[Lady of the Lake (brig)|''Lady of the Lake'']] sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of [[whaling]] and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of the {{ship|RMS|Titanic}} on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.

On her maiden voyage from [[Southampton, England]] bound for New York, ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. ''Titanic'', the brand new ship of the [[White Star Line]], was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of {{convert|22|kn|km/h|0}}. Loss of ''Titanic'' gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the ''Titanic'' disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first [[Safety of Life at Sea]] ([[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]]) convention in 1914. 

After the ''Titanic'' disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers {{USS|Chester|CL-1|6|}} and {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}} to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] could not spare ships for this purpose, so the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] (forerunner of the [[United States Coast Guard]]) assumed responsibility, assigning the [[USCGC Seneca (1908)|USRC ''Seneca'']] and [[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USRC ''Miami'']] to conduct the patrol.

At the first [[International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea]], which was convened in [[London]] on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation.

The second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 &amp; 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol.

Every year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the ''Titanic'' disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the ''Titanic'' and her lost passengers is read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2011/04/15/uscg_marks_99th_anniversary_of_titanic_sinking/ "USCG Marks 99th Anniversary of Titanic Sinking"], boston.com,  Associated Press (New London, Connecticut), 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From  Steamboat Inspection Service to U.S. Coast Guard: Marine Safety in the United States from 1838 - 1946.

=== Administration ===
From its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, {{USCGC|Evergreen|WLB-295|6}}, was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.

From 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] during the ice season.

Due to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to [[Governors Island, New York]]&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Osmer, Stephen R., LTJG USCG "The Aerial Ice Patrol: No More ''Titanics''s" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' March 1976 pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; where they remained until October 1983. 

Today the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in [[New London, Connecticut]]. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in a [[HC-130]] aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland.

The Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart.  Ice Patrol information is also available via http Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season.

[[File:Mining claim, South Yuba River (cropped).jpg|thumb|Claim at the [[Yuba River|South Yuba River]]]]
A '''land claim''' is a legal declaration of desired control over areas of property, including bodies of water. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include [[aboriginal land claim]]s, [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|Antarctic land claims]], and post-colonial land claims.

Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like [[Western Sahara]] or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 

In the [[Colonialism|colonial]] times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the [[de facto]] conditions:
# claim without any action on the ground
# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground
# claim with the claimant visiting the land
# claim with claimant living on the land.

Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be [[Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure|obtained]] by making productive use of it.

==Mining claim (United States)==
A '''mining claim''' is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the [[California gold rush]] of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.

The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of ''[[prior appropriation]]'', by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use.  Other applications of appropriation theory were the [[Homestead Act]], which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.

The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States.  The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the [[Mining Act of 1872]].  All land in the [[Public_domain_(land)|public domain]], that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed.  The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California [[California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]].

The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the [[Australian gold rushes]] which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The [[Oriental Claims]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are one example of this.

===Staking a claim===
[[File:Mining claim corner Blue Ribbon Mine Alaska.jpg|thumb|Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska]]

'''Staking a claim''' involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a "prudent man" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.

There are four main types of mining claims: 
# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) 
# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), 
# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) 
# Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) 

A mining claim always starts out as an '''unpatented claim'''. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A '''patented claim''' is one for which the federal government has issued a ''patent'' (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Land Surveying in Kentucky''' is the practice of [[Land Surveying]] in the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]].

==Consumer Information==

=== Do I need a Survey? ===
It is a good idea to have a property survey:&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When buying, selling, investing in or developing property.
*If a boundary location is unknown or unclear.
*Before improvements are made (buildings, fences, excavation, etc.)
*To stop encroachments from adjoining owners.
*To establish easements and rights of way.
*When timber is cut near a property boundary line.
*When recommended by a lending institution.
*When dividing a large tract of land into a smaller tract or tracts.

===Type of Surveys===
Often a residential customer will request a Boundary Survey. A mortgage inspection is less expensive, but offers much less protection and value. ALTA/ACSM surveys in Kentucky are typically requested only for commercial activity.
*Boundary Survey: A boundary survey of the subject property will be made and the property corners will be located and verified or reset. The improvements on the property will be located and a check for violations or encroachments onto or from the subject property will be made. This survey may be used by the property owner for the construction of a fence or other improvement. Flood plain certification is restricted to a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps FIRM(latest revision), and shall not be construed as a confirmation or denial of flooding potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/150.htm 201 KAR 18:150]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mortgage Inspection: The sole purpose of this inspection is to obtain mortgage title insurance. This is the minimum service that your lender requires for closing your loan. It is a location of improvements and cursory check for violations or encroachments onto or from the subject property based on existing but not confirmed evidence. This does not constitute a boundary survey and is subject to any inaccuracies that a subsequent boundary survey may disclose; no property corners will be set; and, it should not be used or relied upon for the establishment of any fence, structure or other improvement. Flood plain certification is restricted to a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) (latest revision), and shall not be construed as a confirmation or denial of flooding potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/200.htm 201 KAR 18:200]&lt;/ref&gt;
*ALTA/ACSM Survey: This is the most comprehensive type of survey and improvement location. It covers all the aspects of the boundary survey and improvement location and identification for any additional evidence of possession or use which could be adverse to the interest of the purchaser. This survey may include definitive statements regarding the flooding potential in addition to a review of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM).

===Choosing a Surveyor===
Most land surveying work is acquired through the personal recommendation of satisfied clients, lending institutions, attorneys, real estate companies and title companies who frequently handle real estate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Kentucky's 120 [[County (United States)|counties]] elects a County Surveyor. However, a consumer can seek services from any licensed Kentucky Professional Land Surveyor. The status of a licensee or firm can be [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107181235/http://apps.kyboels.ky.gov/SearchableRoster.aspx verified online], including checking for [https://web.archive.org/web/20100204203736/http://apps.kyboels.ky.gov/DisciplinaryAction.aspx Disciplinary Actions] in the past 5 years. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107183408/http://kyboels.ky.gov/ConsumerInfo/MakingComplaint/ Formal complaints] against a Professional Land Surveyor should be made in writing to the [http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors].

===Right of Entry===
Residents should be aware of the right of entry on land of others by a land surveyor, which include persons such as employees that are under the supervision of a Professional Land Surveyor. A professional land surveyor shall not be liable to arrest or a civil action by reason of this entry. No owner or occupant of the land shall be liable for any injury or damage sustained by any person entering upon his or her land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/322-00/470.PDF KRS 322.470]&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Regulation===
Land Surveying in Kentucky is regulated by the Commonwealth in [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/322-00/CHAPTER.HTM KRS 322]. The Standards of Practice are defined in [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/150.htm 201 KAR 18:150]. Compliance is maintained by the [http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors], which was established by an Act of the Kentucky General Assembly in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land Systems in Kentucky==
All [[chain of title]] in the Commonwealth traces back to [[Virginia]] land patents and [[Kentucky]] land patents. The [http://www.sos.ky.gov/ Secretary of State] maintains the security and preservation of these historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/land/ Kentucky Land Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131063400/http://www.sos.ky.gov/land/ |date=2010-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[Deed]] and [[Plat]] records are maintained by Kentucky's [http://www.elect.ky.gov/countyclerks.htm County Clerks].

Most of the state utilizes the [[Metes and bounds]] land system, which is based on English [[Common Law]] and reflects the Commonwealth's original status as a part of [[Virginia]] until statehood in 1792. Parts of Western Kentucky, since it was acquired under the [[Jackson Purchase]] in 1818, utilizes a rectangular system based on the [[Public Land Survey System]] created by the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPX8fBx67DQC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Public+Land+Survey+System%22+%22Western+Kentucky%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o-_4RqDJcc&amp;sig=HINgSLLp--UHNh9pWyYhXnvPG24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ScxpS7q9M4raNdSKsY0G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Public%20Land%20Survey%20System%22%20%22Western%20Kentucky%22&amp;f=false Charles J. Jacobus, ''Texas Real Estate'', pg. 21, 10th edition, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Units of Measure===
Common surveying measures in Kentucky include [[acre]] and the [[survey foot]], which are both now referenced in decimal and historically in fraction. For example, a modern survey should list a distance of one-foot and six-inches as 1.50 feet. Historically lengths were also measured as [[chain (length)]] and [[rod (length)]]. A rod is also known as a pole, both being 16.5 feet. A chain is most commonly 66 feet (4 poles) but can also be 33 feet (2 poles).

==History==
Notable Surveyors in Kentucky History include [[Daniel Boone]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Thomas Bullitt]], [[George Rogers Clark]], and [[Isaac Shelby]].

==Technology==
Modern technology used in surveying in Kentucky includes [[GPS]], the [[Total station]], and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]. A popular [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] system with Kentucky Surveyors is [http://www.carlsonsw.com Carlson Software], which is headquartered in [[Maysville, Kentucky]]. Surveying is also aided by the development of [[Geographic information systems]], such as [http://www.lojic.org LOJIC].

==Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors (KAPS)==
[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveys] (KAPS) maintains and perpetuates an organization for members having common professional problems and interests. The organization provides effective forums for discussion and united action on the part of its members for the enhancement and betterment of professional recognition, status and conditions of employment. KAPS also addresses other matters which contribute to the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KAPS membership and State Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape limnology''' is the spatially explicit study of [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s as they interact with freshwater, terrestrial, and human [[landscape]]s to determine the effects of pattern on [[ecosystem]] processes across temporal and spatial scales. [[Limnology]] is the study of inland water bodies inclusive of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; landscape limnology seeks to integrate all of these ecosystem types.

The [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] component represents spatial hierarchies of landscape features that influence which materials, whether solutes or organisms, are transported to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems; aquatic connections represent how these materials are transported; and human activities reflect features that influence how these materials are transported as well as their quantity and temporal dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.E. Webster, K.S. Cheruvelil and M.T. Bremigan. 2009. The lake landscape-context framework: linking aquatic connections, terrestrial features and human effects at multiple spatial scales. Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie. 30:695-700&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The core principles or themes of [[landscape ecology]] provide the foundation for landscape limnology. These ideas can be synthesized into a set of four landscape ecology themes that are broadly applicable to any aquatic ecosystem type, and that consider the unique features of such ecosystems. 

'''A landscape limnology framework begins with the premise of Thienemann (1925). Wiens (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 2002. Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water. Freshwater Biology 47:501-515&lt;/ref&gt; freshwater ecosystems can be considered patches.''' As such, the location of these patches and their placement relative to other elements of the landscape is important to the ecosystems and their processes. Therefore, the four main themes of landscape limnology are:

'''(1) Patch characteristics:''' The characteristics of a freshwater ecosystem include its physical morphometry, chemical, and biological features, as well as its boundaries. These boundaries are often more easily defined for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., shoreline, [[riparian zone]]s, and emergent vegetation zone) and are often a focal-point for important ecosystem processes linking terrestrial and aquatic components.

'''(2) Patch context:''' The freshwater ecosystem is embedded in a complex terrestrial mosaic (e.g., soils, geology, and land use/cover) that has been shown to drive many within-ecosystem features and processes such as water chemistry, species richness, and primary and secondary productivity. 

'''(3) Patch connectivity and directionality:''' The complex freshwater mosaic is connected to the particular patch of interest and defines the degree to which materials and organisms move across the landscape through freshwater connections. For freshwater ecosystems, these connections often display a strong directionality component that must be explicitly considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, G.W., G.W. Kipphut, M.M. Miller, and J. O’Briens. 2000. Integration of lakes and streams in a landscape perspective: the importance of material processing on spatial patterns and temporal coherence. Freshwater Biology 43: 477-497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcarelli, A.M. and W.A. Wurtsbaugh. 2007. Effects of upstream lakes and nutrient limitation on periphytic biomass and nitrogen fixation in Oligotrophic, subalpine streams. Freshwater Biology 52:2211-2225&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a specific wetland can be connected through groundwater to other wetlands or lakes, or through surface water connections directly to lakes and rivers, or both, and the directionality of those connections will strongly impact the movement of nutrients and biota.

'''(4) Spatial scale and hierarchy:''' Interactions among terrestrial and freshwater elements occur at multiple spatial scales that must be considered hierarchically. The explicit integration of hierarchy into landscape limnology is important because (a) many freshwater ecosystems are hierarchically organized and controlled by processes that are hierarchically organized,&lt;ref&gt;Frissell, C.A., W.J. Liss, C.E. Warren &amp; M.D. Hurley. 1986. A hierarchical framework for stream habitat classification: viewing streams in a watershed context. Environmental Management 10: 199–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"&gt;Tonn, W.M. 1990. Climate change and fish communities: A conceptual framework. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:337-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poff, N.L. 1997. Landscape filters and species traits: towards mechanistic understanding and prediction in stream ecology. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 16: 391–409&lt;/ref&gt; (b) most freshwater ecosystems are managed at multiple spatial scales, from policy set at the national level, to land management conducted at local scales, and (c) the degree of homogeneity among freshwater ecosystems can change in relation to the scale of observation.

==Contributions to other fields==

Findings from landscape limnology research are contributing to many facets of aquatic ecosystem research, management, and conservation.  Landscape limnology is especially relevant for geographical areas with thousands of ecosystems (i.e. lake-rich regions of the world), in situations with a range of human disturbances, or when considering lakes, streams, and wetlands that are connected to other such ecosystems. For example, landscape limnology perspectives have contributed to the development of nutrient criteria for lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.S. Cheruvelil, R.J. Stevenson, S.L. Rollins, S.W. Holden, S. Heaton, and E.K. Torng. 2008. A framework for developing ecosystem-specific nutrient criteria: Integrating biological thresholds with predictive modeling. Limnology and Oceanography 53(2): 773-787&lt;/ref&gt; formation of classification systems that can be used to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Cheruvelil, K.S., P.A. Soranno, M.T. Bremigan, T. Wagner, and S.L. Martin. 2008. Grouping lakes for water quality assessment and monitoring: the roles of regionalization and spatial scale. Environmental Management. 41:425-440&lt;/ref&gt; understanding ecosystem responses to environmental stressors,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. A., A.T. Herlihy, P.R. Kaufmann, and J.M. Eilers. 1991. Acidic lakes and streams in the United States: The role of acidic deposition. Science (Wash.) 252: 1151-1154&lt;/ref&gt; or explaining biogeographic patterns of community composition.&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal education''' is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of [[law]]. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for [[Admission to practice law|admission to legal practice]] in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary [[Law degree|degrees in law]], which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as [[Master of Laws|masters]] and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* [[Continuing legal education]], which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of [[rhetoric]]. Around the third century BC [[Tiberius Coruncanius]] began teaching law as a separate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;George Long article, p. 655 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anqiquities'' by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (''jurisprudentes''), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. "legal education." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007  &lt;http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9106475&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oo-U8MDJVJAJ:www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteen century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Boon and Julian Webb, '[http://letr.org.uk/references/storage/U7RC3RR2/Boon%20%26%20Webb,%20back%20to%20the%20future.pdf Legal Education and Training in England and Wales: Back to the Future?]' (2008) 58(1) ''Journal of Legal Education'' 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of legal education ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===
[[File:Uppsala Gustavianum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gustavianum]]'', The Swedish [[Uppsala University]] built 1622–1625 and now a museum, was one of the pioneers in formal legal education]]
In many countries, including most of those in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the principal law degree is an [[undergraduate degree]], usually known as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country's equivalent of a [[bar exam]]. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the [[Law school in the United States|United States]], the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a [[bachelor's degree]]. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor's degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by [[law school]]s, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SSRN 3021333].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Law Society, [https://www.lawsociety.com.au/about/StudentHub/BecomingAdmitted/PLT/index.htm#1 'Practical Legal Training'], retrieved 8 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a [[barrister]] or as a [[solicitor]] are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
[[Continuing legal education]] (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

==Legal education in different countries==
{{Main article|Law school}}
===Australia===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Australia}}

In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. [[Bond University]] in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2{{fraction|2|3}} years. They also offer a JD in two years. The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111235355/http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[University of Melbourne]] introduced the [[Melbourne Model]], whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible.&lt;ref name="law.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php|publisher=Law.harvard.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for [[graduate entry|graduate-entry]] into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Australian Catholic University]], [[Australian National University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Bond University]], [[Macquarie Law School|Macquarie]], [[Monash University Faculty of Law|Monash]], [[Deakin University School of Law|Deakin]], [[UNSW Faculty of Law|UNSW]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[Adelaide Law School|Adelaide]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], [[Sydney Law School|Sydney]], [[Melbourne University Law School|Melbourne]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], the [[TC Beirne School of Law|University of Queensland]], the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Canberra]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Canada}}

The professional law degree in Canada is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), for [[common law]] jurisdictions, and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law]] for Quebec, a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction. Admittance to an LL.B. or J.D. program requires at least two years of [[undergraduate]] education, although, a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree|(bachelor's) degree]]. The change in academic [[nomenclature]] redesignating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—because it is the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2007/11/13/to-jd-or-not-to-jd/ To JD or Not JD — Law is Cool], November 13, 2007.

[[List of law schools in China]]

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Legal education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the [[Common Professional Examination]] conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) currently offered at the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU), [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and [[City University of Hong Kong]], before starting vocational training: a year's [[pupillage]] for [[barrister]]s or a two-year [[training contract]] for [[solicitor]]s.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===
{{Main article|Legal education in India}}
{{See also|Autonomous law schools in India|Common Law Admission Test|List of law schools in India}}

The [[Bar Council of India]] prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961], which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of [[Bachelor's degree]]. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the "licenza in diritto". There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies ([[Bologna process]]):
* first a license of law program (''Licence de droit''): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (''Master de droit''): two-year period
* Ph.D. in Law (''Doctorat en droit''): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized : public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in Law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student's grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the [[University of Tokyo]] Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically-dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|title=Legal Education and the Reproduction of the Elite in Japan, 1 Asian-Pac. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 2|year=1999|publisher=Hawaii.edu|author=Setsuo Miyazawa|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081700/http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the implementation of the "law school system" in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized "cram schools" trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]]. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, [[legal research]]. During this period, the most "capable trainees" are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school {{nihongo|law schools|法科大学院|hōka daigakuin}} that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from "elite" Japanese universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]] or [[Hitotsubashi University]]. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (''[[benrishi]]''), tax accountants (''[[zeirishi]]''), [[scrivener]]s, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys ("bengoshi"), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
{{Main article|Law school in Korea}}

Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized "private educational institutes" exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the [[Judicial Research and Training Institute]] of the [[Supreme Court of Korea]]. During this period, the most capable trainees are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (''법학전문대학원''). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government's approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (''변리사''), tax attorneys (''세무사''), [[solicitor]]s(''법무사''), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|Legal education in Malaysia}}
As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Malaysian Higher School Certificate]], [[A-Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]], Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]] that include [[Sharia]] or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/programmes-courses/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-law-llb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuha.unisza.edu.my/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072652/http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the Philippines}}
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the LEGAL EDUCATION BOARD, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals.  Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino.  Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education.  The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University.  The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law.  Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
[[Law degree]] – jurist (often compared to an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and [[Ukraine]] after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor's or master's degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor's – master's) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the [[Bologna accords]]. See also [[academic degree]]. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor's degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master's degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master's degree.

=== Serbia ===
{{See also|History of legal education in Serbia|University of Belgrade Faculty of Law}}

To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. Studies last for five years (ten semesters) in accordance to the [[Bologna process|Bologna Convention]]. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. Students are divided into full-time students and part-time students. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international [[moot court]] competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a [[prosecutor]].

Since 1998, LL.B. programmes may be entered directly at the [[undergraduate]] level; at the same time, the LLB. continues to be offered [[postgraduate]] and may then be accelerated dependent on the [[bachelor's degree]]. The programme lasts between two and four years correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726092702/http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm |date=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Legal education#Australia|Australia, above]]).  See [[Bachelor of Laws #South Africa]].

Although not formally required for specialised practice, further training, e.g. [[Master of Science in Taxation|in tax]], is usually via [[postgraduate diploma]]s or focused, coursework-based [[LL.M.]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/south-africa |title=Master of Laws (LL.M.)

See [[Master of Laws #South Africa]]; [[Doctor of Law #South Africa]].

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practice as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or [[magistrate]] in the [[South African Law#Court System in South Africa|lower courts]], but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practice as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Law_DoL_Report.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For admission as an attorney, one serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for two years, and then writes a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. See [[Attorneys in South Africa]]. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]].

Attorneys may additionally qualify as [[Notary public|Notaries]] and [[Conveyancer]]s, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssalead.org.za/upload/CONVEYANCING%20COURSE%20AND%20NOTARIAL%20PRACTICE%20COURSE%202012%20v7.pdf |title=Courses in Conveyancing and Notarial Practice |publisher=Lssalead.org.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys – see [[Patent attorney #South Africa]].

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate "of proven experience and skill" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a "silk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=A Career at the Bar in South Africa – The General Council of the Bar (GCB) |publisher=Sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Advocates in South Africa]].

The Act regulating admission to practice law ("The Qualifications of Legal Practitioners Amendment Act of 1997") is being revised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615033823/http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm |date=June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South American countries ===
{{Main article|Law in South America}}
The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

=== Sri Lanka ===
{{main|Legal education in Sri Lanka}}
In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be 'admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]]. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an [[LL.B.]] (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Jaffna]], [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] and [[University of Peradeniya]]) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don't hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a [[Graduate Diploma in Law]] where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a [[barrister]], [[legal executive]], or [[solicitor]]. [[Bar Professional Training Course]] is regarded as one of the hardest degrees and presently it is the most expensive law-related degree.

===United States===
[[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[William &amp; Mary School of Law]], established in 1779, is the oldest law school in the USA]]
{{Main article|Legal education in the United States|Law school in the United States}}
{{See also|Law School Admission Council}}

The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a [[law school]] program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt; http://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readerrules.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state's bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States,in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), a [[Doctoral]] degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a [[bachelor's degree]]). The law school program is considered to be a [[professional school]] program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves "doctor").

Research degrees that are awarded include the [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional [[Law clerk#United States|judicial clerkship]] (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, he or she is expected to pursue [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the [[bar association|bar]] vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13382">[[Image:Light characteristics.svg|thumb|400px|Symbols and abbreviations for light characteristics]]
A '''light characteristic''' is a graphic and text description of a navigational light sequence or colour displayed on a [[nautical chart]] or in a [[Light List]] with the chart symbol for a [[lighthouse]], [[lightvessel]], [[buoy]] or [[sea mark]] with a [[light]] on it. The graphic indicates how the real light may be identified when looking at its actual light output type or sequence. Different lights use different colours, frequencies and light patterns, so mariners can identify which light they are seeing.

==Abbreviations==
While light characteristics can be described in prose, e.g. "Flashing white every three seconds", lists of lights and navigation chart annotations use abbreviations. The abbreviation notation is slightly different from one light list to another, with dots added or removed, but it usually follows a pattern similar to the following (see the chart to the right for examples).
* An abbreviation of the type of light, e.g. "Fl." for flashing, "F." for fixed.
* The color of the light, e.g. "W" for white, "G" for green, "R" for red, "Y" for yellow. If no color is given, a white light is generally implied.
* The cycle period, e.g. "10s" for ten seconds.
* Additional parameters are sometimes added:
:* The height of the light above the chart datum for height (usually based on [[tide|high water]]). e.g. 15m for 15 metres.
:* The range in which the light is visible, e.g. "10M" for 10 [[nautical mile]]s.

An example of a complete light characteristic is "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that the light is a ''group occulting light'' in which a group of three eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; the light is white; the light is 15 metres above the chart datum  and is visible for {{convert|10|nmi|km}}.

==Light patterns==
===Fixed light===
A fixed light, abbreviated "F", is a continuous and steady light.

===Flashing light===
A flashing light is a rhythmic light in which the total duration of the light in each period is clearly shorter than the total duration of the darkness and in which the flashes of light are all of equal duration. It is most commonly used for a single-flashing light which exhibits only single flashes which are repeated at regular intervals, in which case it is abbreviated simply as "Fl". It can also be used with a group of flashes which are regularly repeated, in which case the abbreviation is "Fl.(2)" or "Gr Fl.(2)", for a group of two flashes. Another possibility is a composite group, in which successive groups in the period have different numbers of flashes, e.g. "Fl. (2+1)" indicates a group of two flashes, followed by one flash.

A specific case sometimes used&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; is when the flashes are longer than two seconds. Such a light is sometimes denoted "long flashing" with the abbreviation "L.Fl".

If the frequency of flashes is large (more than 30&lt;ref name=LLQuick&gt;''Light List'' states at one point that only "frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute" is considered "Flashing", yet at another that only "a rate of 60 flashes per minute" is considered "Quick", leaving the interval in-between undefined.&lt;/ref&gt; or 50&lt;ref name=LoL&gt;''List of Lights''&lt;/ref&gt; per minute) the light is denoted as a "quick light", see below.

===Occulting light===

An occulting light is a rhythmic light in which the duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of flashing off, rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, it can be used for a single occulting light that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).

===Isophase light===
An isophase light, abbreviated "Iso", is a light which has dark and light periods of equal length. The prefix derives from the Greek ''iso-'' meaning "same".

===Quick light===
A quick light, abbreviated "Q", is a special case of a flashing light with a large frequency (more than 30&lt;ref name=LLQuick/&gt; or 50&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; per minute). If the sequence of flashes is interrupted by regularly repeated eclipses of constant and long duration, the light is denoted "interrupted quick", abbreviated "I.Q". 

Group notation similar to flashing and occulting lights is also sometimes&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; used (e.g. Q.(9)). 

Another distinction sometimes&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; made is between quick (more than 50 and less than 80 flashes per minute), very quick (more than 80 and less than 160 flashes per minutes, abbreviated "V.Q") and ultra quick (no less than 160 flashes per minute, abbreviate "U.Q"). This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q. for interrupted ultra quick, or grouping, e.g. V.Q.(9) for a very quick group of nine flashes. Quick characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. V.Q.(6)+L.Fl. for a very quick group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.

===Morse code===
A Morse code light is light in which appearances of light of two clearly different durations (dots and dashes) are grouped to represent a character or characters in the [[Morse Code]]. For example, "Mo. (A)" is a light in which in each period light is shown for a short period (dot) followed by a long period (dash), the Morse Code for "A".

===Fixed and flashing===
A fixed and flashing light, abbreviated "F. Fl", is a light in which a fixed low intensity light is combined with a flashing high intensity light.

===Alternating===
An alternating light, abbreviated "Al", is a light which shows alternating colors. For example, "Al WG" shows white and green lights alternately.

During his visit, official negotiations on the sale of [[US 2]] amphibious aircraft for the Indian Navy and the long pending civil nuclear agreements have both progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/indias-modi-maintains-warm-ties-with-japans-abe/article20336839/|title=India’s Modi maintains warm ties with Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe |author=Iain Marlow |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-02/news/53479980_1_shinzo-abe-strategic-global-partnership-japan |title=India, Japan sign key agreements; to share 'Special Strategic Global Partnership' |date=2 September 2014 |newspaper = Economic Times |author=Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Modi delivered his maiden speech in the [[sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] on 27 September 2014, in which he called for the reform and expansion of the [[United Nations Security Council]], most notably bringing attention to India's long standing demand of a permanent membership. He expressed his concerns over the relevance of a 20th century setup in the 21st century, and stressed the need to evaluate the UN's performance in the past 70 years. He also questioned why the UN should serve as the G-All for global governance, instead of several parallel sub-groupings like the [[G7]] or [[G20]]. In the wake of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] threat in West Asia and other similar threats in other parts of the world, Modi urged for the immediate implementation of the 'Comprehensive on International Terrorism' by the UN and offered India's pro-active role in it, citing India as a victim of terrorism for decades. Prior to his speech, he, along with External Affairs Minister [[Sushma Swaraj]], met with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], to discuss issues relating to UN governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-at-unga-lets-work-towards-a-sustainable-world-move-towards-g-all/articleshow/43642407.cms|title=PM Modi at UNGA: Let's work towards a sustainable world; move towards G-All|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also ridiculed the possibility of any multilateral intervention on the issue of Kashmir, a demand [[Nawaz Sharif]] made in his address at the UNGA on 26 September, stating that the Indian government is ready for 'bilateral talk' with Pakistan provided that Pakistan cultivate a suitable environment for talks by giving up its terrorism policy against India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/prime-minister-narendra-modi-s-address-to-un-general-assembly-in-10-points-598833?pfrom=home-lateststories|title=Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Address to UN General Assembly in 10 Points|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi commented briefly on climate change and the use of clean energy.

A '''Local Notice to Mariners''' is an authoritative instruction issued by a designated official, typically the [[harbormaster]].

==United States==

In the United States, notices are issued by each [[U.S. Coast Guard]] District to disseminate important information affecting navigational safety within that District. This Notice reports changes and deficiencies in aids to navigation maintained by the Coast Guard. Other marine information such as new [[nautical chart|charts]], channel depths, naval operations, and regattas is included. Since temporary information of short duration is not included in the weekly [[Notice to Mariners]], the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be the only source of such information. Small craft using the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and small harbors not normally used by oceangoing vessels need it to keep charts and publications up-to-date.

Since correcting information for U.S. charts in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from the Coast Guard Local Notices, it is normal to expect a lag of 1 or 2 weeks for the ''Notice to Mariners'' to publish a correction from this source.

The ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be obtained free of charge by contacting the appropriate Coast Guard District Commander. Vessels operating in ports and waterways in several districts must obtain the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' from each district. &lt;!-- See Figure 422 for a complete list of U.S. Coast Guard Districts. provide a link instead--&gt;

===Sources===
The text of the US material originated from section 422 of The [[American Practical Navigator]], a document produced by the government of the [[United States|United States of America]].

==Examples==
LNTMs are, by definition, concerned with local issues. Each issuing authority has its own series of LNTMs – there is no international standard numbering or indexing scheme. Individual LNTMs may concern short or long term situations. At [http://www.qhmportsmouth.com/port-lntm/ Portsmouth], mariners are instructed by LNTM 28/07 to ''keep clear of warship berths''. At [http://www.holyheadport.com/LNTM%20Index.pdf Holyhead], LNTM 5/2008 concerns ''Bunkering or transferring oil in port''. At [http://www.conservancy.co.uk/water/local_notices.asp Chichester], No 16 of 2008 ''Sea defence works at Hayling Island'' gives timely information about dredging operations.

[[File:LBL Acoustic Positioning System Aquamap Diver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1: Method of the operation of a long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system]]

A '''long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system'''&lt;ref&gt;Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, Chapter 4, P.H. Milne, 1983, {{ISBN|0-87201-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three broad classes of [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|underwater acoustic positioning systems]] that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are [[Ultra-short baseline|ultra short baseline systems]] (USBL) and [[Short baseline acoustic positioning system|short baseline systems]] (SBL). LBL systems are unique in that they use networks of sea-floor mounted baseline transponders as reference points for navigation. These are generally deployed around the perimeter of a work site. The LBL technique results in very high positioning accuracy and position stability that is independent of water depth.  It is generally better than 1-meter and can reach a few centimeters accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA Diving Manual, Edition 4, Underwater Navigation, Section 10.2., {{ISBN|0-941332-70-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-941332-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBL systems are generally employed for precision underwater survey work where the accuracy or position stability of ship-based (SBL, USBL) positioning systems does not suffice.

== Operation and performance ==
[[File:AquaMap Diver LBL Acoustic Positioning Equipment.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Figure 2: A dive team (Envirotech Diving) with their AquaMap LBL acoustic underwater positioning system including three baseline transponders (B) and diver stations (A) mounted on scooters. The baseline stations are first deployed in the corners of a work site. Their relative position is then precisely measured using the AquaMap system's automatic acoustic self-survey capability. For geo-referenced operations, the baseline positions are surveyed by differential GPS or a laser positioning equipment (total station). During a dive, the diver station interrogates the baseline stations to measure the distances, which are then converted to positions.]]

Long baseline systems determine the position of a vehicle or diver by acoustically measuring the distance from a vehicle or diver interrogator to three or more seafloor deployed baseline transponders. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from pressure sensors on the devices, are then used to triangulate the position of the vehicle or diver.  In figure 1, a diver mounted interrogator (A) sends a signal, which is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D).  The transponders reply, and the replies are received again by the diver station (A).  Signal run time measurements now yield the distances A-B, A-C and A-D, which are used to compute the diver position by triangulation or position search algorithms.  The resulting positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers. These can be readily converted to a geo-referenced coordinate system such as latitude/longitude or UTM if the geo-positions of the baseline stations are first established.

Long baseline systems get their name from the fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Acoustics, Malcolm J. Crocker 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-25293-X}}, 9780471252931, page 462&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent position error.&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Robert D. Christ and Robert L. Wernli Sr, Section 4.2.8. Capabilities and Limitations of Acoustic Positioning, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels.&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Section 4.2.6.4 Long Baseline (LBL)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, sea floor mounting makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth.&lt;ref&gt;LBL Underwater Positioning, Hydro International Magazine, Jan/Feb 2008, Volume 12, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;  For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.

The search and inspection of the lost nuclear submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS Thresher]] by the U.S. Navy oceanographic vessel [[USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11)|USNS Mizar]] in 1963 is frequently credited as the origin of modern underwater acoustic navigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Mizar primarily used a short baseline (SBL) system to track the bathyscaphe [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste 1]].  However, its capability also included seafloor transponders, which in conjunction with early navigation satellites supported station-keeping with a precision of about 300 feet, considered remarkable at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Universe Below, Page 77, William J. Broad &amp; Dimitry Schidlovski 1998, {{ISBN|0-684-83852-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-684-83852-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Ohio-class submarine launches Tomahawk Cruise missiles (artist concept).jpg|thumb|right|Figure 3: Precisely establishing the position of nuclear submarines prior to missile launches was an early application of long baseline acoustic positioning systems. Covert networks of sea floor transponders could survive and provide a precision navigation capability even after GPS satellites had been knocked out.]]

By the mid-1960s and possibly earlier, the Soviets were developing underwater navigation systems including seafloor transponders to allow nuclear submarines to operate precisely while staying submerged.&lt;ref&gt;History of Russian Underwater Acoustics, page 722. Oleg A. Godin, David R. Palmer, 2008, {{ISBN|981-256-825-5}}, {{ISBN|978-981-256-825-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides navigating through canyons and other difficult underwater terrain, there was also a need to establish the position of the submarine prior to the launch of a nuclear missile (ICBM).  In 1981, acoustic positioning was proposed as part of the U.S. military's [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]] system.&lt;ref&gt;MX Missile Basing, pages 173-175, 1981, {{ISBN|1-4289-2450-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4289-2450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A network of 150 covert transponder fields was envisioned.  Submarines typically are guided by inertial navigation systems, but these dead reckoning systems develop position drift which must be corrected by occasional position fixes from a GNSS system.  If the enemy were to knock out the GNSS satellites, the submarine could rely on the covert transponder network to establish its position and program the missile's own inertial navigation system for launch.

Land exploration and surveying has played a crucial role in the development of Queensland. Surveyors and cartographers played an active part in establishing Queensland's borders, physically surveying the land as well as creating maps, survey plans and registers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|title=Collections and services|last=|first=|date=21 September 2018|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003192050/https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|archive-date=4 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical input of the surveying and mapping industry to the development of Queensland is an important factor in the role the department plays in providing a valuable resource for a wide range of community interests and government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its short history the museum has established a comprehensive collection, housing many important maps, survey plans and artefacts, significant to the history of mapping, surveying and land development particularly in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The museum acquires, preserves, catalogues and displays information and artefacts pertaining to historical land settlement, surveying and cartographic activities in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Collection strategy ===
The museum aims to identify records, artefacts, maps and plans that are useful in filling gaps in the knowledge about the history of mapping and surveying in Queensland, and make such knowledge accessible. New material is constantly being identified as important for research purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical collections ==
Our physical and digital collections include:

* historical maps and plans
* historical photographs
* aerial photography
* artefacts
* biographies of surveyors and cartographers
* documents (e.g. early Queensland Treasury rental sheets)
* publications.

== History ==
In 1982, the [[Queensland Government]] through the [[Surveyor General of Queensland]], JM Serisier ordered that a mapping and surveying museum be set up in order to preserve the mapping and surveying history of Queensland. The original museum was established in the [[Land Administration Building|Lands Administration Building]], (now the Conrad Treasury Hotel), and Bill Kitson was tasked with establishing and operating the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the support of the department and the mapping and surveying industry Kitson set about collecting artefacts, which were rapidly disappearing as technology overtook the traditional means of creating maps and surveys. The museum’s collection grew from simply holding artefacts to include diaries, artwork, photographs and biographies which captured the personal and social history of those involved in surveying and mapping. Many historical maps of Queensland were also acquired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1987, the museum moved to the newly constructed Landcentre building  in [[Woolloongabba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1988, in order to preserve the artefacts that had been collected an agreement was signed with the [[Queensland Museum]] to become custodian of the collections whilst the government provides staff to manage and run the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1991, the focus of the museum was broadened and it was renamed the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying to include history of land development in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2018, the museum relocated to 317 [[Edward Street, Brisbane|Edward Street]] in the [[Brisbane CBD]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">'''NavPix''' is the proprietary name applied by [[Navman]] to its technology that combines an image with geographical data.

The "NavPix" name is used for both the software and the geo-referenced image that results from that software.

==NavPix software==
The NavPix technology enables users to take a [[JPEG]] image using the integrated digital camera on the N Series ("N" for NavPix), iCN 720 or iCN 750 portable Navman GPS navigation devices.

The Navman's GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]) receiver determines the latitude and longitude of where that image was taken. That information is then written into the image's Exif ([[Exchangeable image file format]]) meta data by the '''NavPix software'''. The NavPix, therefore, effectively provides a [[Georeference]] of the location where the image was taken, which is not necessarily the same georeference as the object being "NavPix-ed".

The NavPix image can then be used to define a destination or [[point of interest]] on compatible Navman devices.

==NavPix sources==
Furthermore, as the geographical information is written to the meta data, the image itself can be shared between compatible devices or uploaded to Navman's NavPix Library which offers a wide range of NavPix images that have been taken by both Navman users and sourced from professional photo providers, including [[Lonely Planet]].

The NavPix Library also enables people to upload non-NavPix images (including other formats such as [[GIF]]) and convert them to NavPix images by using entering either the latitude and longitude they want to associate with the image or by entering the address and using the Library's software to generate the latitude and longitude values based on a [[Postal code]] look-up.

Unlike some geo-referencing applications, the NavPix Library writes the georeference values to the image itself via the [[Exif]] meta data.

==Common Misconceptions==
The photo taking abilities do not help navigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Navigational instruments''' refers to the instruments used by nautical navigators and pilots as tools of their trade. The purpose of navigation is to ascertain the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. to arrive at the port or point of destination.

==Charts and drafting instruments==
*'''[[Nautical chart|Charts]]''' are maps of the areas to be navigated with details specific to the marine environment.
*'''Computing aids''': used in the necessary mathematical calculations. Today electronic [[computers]] or [[calculators]] are used.  Other traditional aids used included tables (trigonometric, logarithms, etc.) and [[slide rules]].
*'''[[Caliper#Divider caliper|Dividers]]''' used for measuring lengths of lines and approximate lengths of non-linear paths on a chart.
*'''[[Nautical almanac]]''' used to determine the position in the sky of a celestial body after a sight has been taken.
*'''[[Parallel rulers|Parallel rules]]''' used for transferring a line to a parallel position.  Also used to compare the orientation of a line to a magnetic or geographic orientation on a [[compass rose]].

==Direct measuring==
*'''[[Chip log]] and [[hourglass|sand glass]]''' serve to measure the ship's speed through the water.
*'''[[Sounding line]]''' used to measure the depth of the water and to pick up samples from the bottom.

==Position finding instruments==

===Celestial navigation instruments===

These instruments are used primarily to measure the elevation or altitude of a [[celestial object]]:

*'''[[Back staff]]''', the best known of which is the Davis' quadrant.  It could measure the altitude of the sun without having the navigator directly observe the sun.
*'''[[Cross staff]]''', an older instrument long out of use.
*'''[[Kamal (navigation)|Kamal]]''' Very simple instrument used primarily by Arabian navigators. It consists of a small board with a knotted piece of twine through the center. The observer holds one of the knots in his mouth and extends the board away so that the edges make a constant angle with his eyes.
*'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]''' Derived from the [[astrolabe]], it was developed in late 15th century and found use in the 16th to 17th centuries.  It was replaced by the [[back staff]] and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]].
*'''[[Quadrant (instrument)|Quadrant]]''' A very simple instrument which used a plumb bob.

These instruments are also used to measure the angular distance between objects:

*'''[[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]''', invented in 1731.  The first widely accepted instrument that could measure an angle without being strongly affected by movement.
*'''[[Sextant]]''', derived from the octant in 1757, eventually made all previous instruments used for the same purpose obsolete.

===Bearing instruments===
*'''[[Pelorus (instrument)|Pelorus]]''' used to determine bearings relative to the ship's heading of landmarks, other ships, etc.

===Compasses===
*'''[[Bearing compass]]''' used to determine magnetic bearings of landmarks, other ships or celestial bodies.
*'''[[Magnetic compass]]''' used to determine the magnetic heading of the ship.

===Timekeeping===
*'''[[Marine chronometer]]''' used to determine time at the [[prime meridian]] with great precision which is necessary when reducing sights in celestial navigation.
*'''[[Nocturnal (instrument)|Nocturnal]]''' used to determine apparent local time by viewing the [[Polaris]] and its surrounding stars.
*'''[[Sundial#Ring dials|Ring dial]]''' or '''astronomical ring''' used to measure the height of a celestial body above the horizon. It could be used to find the altitude of the sun or determine local time.  It let sunlight shine through a small orifice on the rim of the instrument.  The point of light striking the far side of the instrument gave the altitude or tell time.

All those mentioned were the traditional instruments used until well into the second half of the 20th century.  After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and depth finders have totally replaced their older counterparts.  [[Radar]] has become widespread even in small boats.  Some Electronic aids to navigation like [[LORAN]] have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by [[GPS]].

      <comment>The referenced German article gives the number "37,000 m" and unlike in English, the comma denotes the decimal separator, so it's an equivalent of dot in English notation. This means the difference is 37 meters (see the German version of the article). The trailing zeros must stand for the precision of the measurement (compare to the German version that says the difference is exactly 37 m).</comment>

'''''Normalnull''''' ("standard zero") or '''Normal-Null''' (short '''N.&amp;nbsp;N.''' or '''NN''' ) is an outdated official [[Geodetic system#Vertical data|vertical datum]] used in Germany. Elevations using this reference system were to be marked "Meter über Normal-Null" (“meters above standard zero”). Normalnull has been replaced by [[Normalhöhennull]] (short NHN).

== History ==
In 1878 reference heights were taken from the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum]] and transferred to the [[Berlin Observatory#New Berlin Observatory|New Berlin Observatory]] in order to define the [[Normalhöhenpunkt 1879]]. Normalnull has been defined as a level going through an imaginary point 37.000&amp;nbsp;m below ''Normalhöhenpunkt 1879''. When the New Berlin Observatory was demolished in 1912 the reference point was moved east to the village of Hoppegarten (now part of the town of [[Müncheberg]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;S.

In the [[British Isles]], an '''ordnance datum''' or '''OD''' is a [[Geodetic_system#Vertical_data|vertical datum]] used by an ordnance survey as the basis for deriving altitudes on [[map]]s.  A [[spot height]] may be expressed as '''AOD''' for "above ordnance datum".  Usually mean sea level (MSL) is used for the datum.  In particular:

* In Great Britain, OD for the [[Ordnance Survey]] is '''ODN''' ('''Ordnance Datum Newlyn'''), defined as the MSL at [[Newlyn]] in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921. Prior to 1921, OD was taken from the level of the [[Victoria Dock (Liverpool)|Victoria Dock, Liverpool]] ('''ODL'''). The difference between the different data varies across the country; full details are available from the Ordnance Survey website (below).
* In [[Northern Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] is '''Belfast Ordnance Datum''', the MSL at Clarendon Dock, [[Belfast]] between 1951 and 1956.
* In the [[Republic of Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] is '''Malin Ordnance Datum''': the MSL at Portmoor Pier, [[Malin Head]], [[County Donegal]], between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref name="osi"&gt;[http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp Irish Grid Reference System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614230048/http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp |date=2008-06-14 }} from OSI website&lt;/ref&gt;
** Prior to 1970, '''Poolbeg Ordnance Datum''' was used: the low water of [[spring tide]] at [[Poolbeg Lighthouse]], Dublin, on 8 April 1837.  Poolbeg OD was about 2.7 metres (9 feet) lower than Malin OD.&lt;ref name="osi"/&gt;

==Tunnel datum==
'''Tunnel datum''' is a datum based on an ordnance datum and used in designing tunnels which pass below sea level.
* for the [[London Underground]], a tunnel datum of ODN -100 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/victoria-Environmental-Statement-Main-Report.pdf|title=Victoria Station Upgrade Environmental Statement: Main Report |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |pages=2–6; §2.5.4, fn 2 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60m AOD is 40m ATD (above tunnel datum)
* for the [[Channel Tunnel]], a tunnel datum of ODN &amp;minus;200 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Radcliffe |first=Eric |title=Engineering the Channel Tunnel |editor=Colin J Kirkland |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |chapter=Control and Construction Surveys |isbn=0-419-17920-8 |page=53 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60 m is 140 m ATD

'''Philosophy of geography''' is the subfield of [[philosophy]] which deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[axiology|axiological]] issues in [[geography]], with geographic methodology in general, and with more broadly related issues such as the perception and representation of space and place.

==Overview==
Though methodological issues concerning geographical knowledge have been debated for centuries, [[Richard Hartshorne]] (1899–1992) is often credited with its first major systematic treatment in English, ''The Nature of Geography: A Critical Survey of Current Thought in the Light of the Past'', which appeared in 1939, and which prompted several volumes of critical essays in subsequent decades.  [[John Kirtland Wright]] (1891–1969), an American geographer notable for his [[cartography]] and study of the history of geographical thought, coined the related term [[geosophy]] in 1947, for this kind of broad study of geographical knowledge.  Other books oft-cited as key works in the field include [[David Harvey]]'s 1969 ''Explanation in Geography'' and [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s 1974 The Production of Space.  It was a discussion of issues raised by the latter which in part inspired the founding of a ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' in the 1990s.

The ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' was founded in 1997 by Andrew Light, a philosopher currently at George Mason University, and Jonathan Smith a geographer at Texas A&amp;M University.  Three volumes of an annual peer-reviewed journal, ''Philosophy and Geography,'' were published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield Press which later became a bi-annual journal published by Carfax publishers.  This journal merged with another journal started by geographers, ''Ethics, Place, and Environment,'' in 2005 to become ''Ethics, Place, and Environment:  A journal of philosophy and geography'' published by Routledge.  The journal was edited by Light and Smith up to 2009, and has published work by philosophers, geographers, and others in allied fields, on questions of space, place, and the environment broadly construed.  It has come to be recognized as instrumental in expanding the scope of the field of environmental ethics to include work on urban environments.

In 2009 Smith retired from the journal and Benjamin Hale from the University of Colorado came on as the new co-editor.  Hale and Light relaunched the journal in January 2011 as Ethics, Policy, and Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217145734/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the journal has since focused more on the relationship between environmental ethics and policy, it still welcomes submissions on relevant work from geographers.

A book series, also initially published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield, and later by Cambridge Scholars Press, began in 2002 to publish the transactions of the ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'''s annual meetings, organized by Gary Backhaus and John Murungi of Towson University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|title=IASESP Conference History|author=|date=2 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002045202/http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|archivedate=2 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the society sponsoring these annual meetings became the ''International Association for the Study of Environment, Space, and Place'', and in 2009 the book series gave way to a peer-reviewed journal, ''Environment, Space, Place'', published semiannually and currently edited by C. Patrick Heidkamp, Troy Paddock, and Christine Petto of Southern Connecticut State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|title=Environment, Space, Place - www.zetabooks.com|author=|date=9 July 2009|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709084916/http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|archivedate=9 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Place identity''' or '''place-based identity''' refers to a cluster of ideas about [[Sense of place|place]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in the fields of [[geography]], [[urban planning]], [[urban design]], [[landscape architecture]], [[environmental psychology]], [[ecocriticism]] and urban sociology/ecological sociology. Place identity is sometimes called [[urban character]], [[neighbourhood character]] or local character. Place identity has become a significant issue in the last 25 years in urban planning and design. Place identity concerns the meaning and significance of places for their inhabitants and users, and how these meanings contribute to individuals' conceptualizations of self.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2011. On time, place and happiness. New Zealand Geographer, 67(1), pp.6-15. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-7939.2011.01192.x  
&lt;/ref&gt; Place identity also relates to the context of modernity, history and the politics of representation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45636842|title=City and nation : rethinking place and identity|last=P.|first=Smith, Michael|last2=Thomas.|first2=Bender,|date=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0765808714|oclc=45636842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[historical determinism]], which intersects historical events, social spaces and groups by [[gender]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this way, it explores how spaces have evolved over time by exploring the [[social constructs]] through time and the development of space, place and power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To the same extent, the politics of representation is brought into context, as the making of place identity in a community also relates to the exclusion or inclusion in a community.  Through this, some have argued that place identity has become an area for social change because it gives [[marginalized]] communities agency{{clarify|date=June 2017}} over their own spaces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the same respect, it is argued that place identity has also been used to intervene social change and perpetuate oppression from a top-down approach by creating segregated spaces for marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Place attachment and sense of place ==
In some ways it is related to the concepts of [[place attachment]] and [[sense of place]]. Place identity is largely related to the concepts of community formation because it recognizes that geographical spaces do not solely bond a community together but rather there are social bonds that account for community formation. Those social forces often are feelings of belonging and security, which involve theoretical formations of community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Concepts in Community Studies|last=Blackshaw|first=Tony|publisher=Sage|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-2844-1|location=London|pages=97–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical formations of community, which were identified in ''Community: Seeking Safety in an Insecure World'' (Bauman, 2001) as bonds formed by similar locality, culture, language, kinship and/or experiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, identity also conceives feelings of security and freedom as one is able to self-identify and especially, when it comes to being able to foster agency over community formation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the similar and shared experiences of culture, language and locality foster the sense of community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872630621|title=Neighborhood as refuge : community reconstruction, place remaking, and environmental justice in the city|last=Isabelle,|first=Anguelovski,|isbn=9780262525695|oclc=872630621}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fostering of community is largely seen as an extension of agency because when a community is able to achieve a sense of place and place attachment, this allows for individuals to reinforce their own identities and strengthen their bonds within their community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Methodology ==
Methodologies for understanding place identity primarily involve qualitative techniques, such as interviewing, [[participant observation]], [[discourse analysis]] and mapping a range of physical elements. Some urban planners, urban designers and landscape architects use forms of [[deliberative planning]], [[design charettes]] and [[participatory design]] with local communities as a way of working with place identity to transform existing places as well as create new ones. This kind of planning and design process is sometimes referred to as [[placemaking]].

=== Case studies ===
The following case studies are examples of how place identity is researched on the field.

==== Cape Cod, Massachusetts ====
In a study by Lee Cuba and David M. Hummon (1993), they focus on Cape Cod, Massachusetts residents and how social and environmental factors are associated with place identity. Place identity in regards to "at-homeness" was defined by existence, affiliations, and locus. Community members were asked if they feel at home in Cape Cod to measure the positive responses for existence. The open-ended responses to why community members feel at home were used to measure place affiliation. A close-ended question, "Do you associate feeling at home with living in this particular house or apartment, with living in this community, or with living on the Cape, in general?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuba|first=Lee|last2=Hummon|first2=David M.|date=1993|title=A Place to Call Home: Identification with Dwelling, Community, and Region|jstor=4121561|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=34|issue=1|pages=111–131|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1993.tb00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to measure locus. Most respondents reported they did feel "at home".

==== Michigan and the Great Lakes ====
Michigan and the Great Lakes are analyzed to see the values and connections shared within the residents of Michigan. A questionnaire was given to Michigan residents to see how attached the residents are. The questionnaire consisted of statements and the statements were evaluated through the five-point Likert scale. As a result, the data revealed "Michigan's voters have developed a strong sense of place regarding the state".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nanzer|first=Bruce|date=2004|title=Measuring Sense of Place: A Scale for Michigan|jstor=25610679|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis|volume=26|issue=3|pages=362–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two case studies shows that place has a lot more to offer than just a physical location. Understanding how to measure a sense of place assist policy makers in decision making and creating potential policy implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They will take the community's issues into consideration during the planning process once they understand the values of a community.

A '''polynya''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|j|ə}} is an area of open water surrounded by [[sea ice]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Stringer and J.E. Groves. 1991. [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic44-S-164.pdf ''Extent of Polynyas in the Bering and Chukchi Seas'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is now used as geographical term for an area of unfrozen sea within the ice pack. It is a [[loanword]] from {{lang-ru|полынья}} (polynya) {{IPA-ru|pəɫɨˈnʲja}}, which refers to a natural ice hole, and was adopted in the 19th century by polar explorers to describe navigable portions of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Sherard Osborn, Peter Wells and A. Petermann. 1866. ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australia'', Vol 12 no 2 1867–1868 pp 92–113 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1799584 On the Exploration of the North Polar Region]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polynya?show=0&amp;t=1283765336 polynya], Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In past decades, for example, some polynyas, such as the [[Weddell Polynya]], have lasted over multiple winters (1974–1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/ANTARCTIC/weddell_polynya.html Weddell Polynya], NASA, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
Polynyas are formed through two main processes:

* '''Sensible heat polynya''': this is thermodynamically driven, and typically occurs when warm water [[upwelling]] keeps the surface water temperature at or above the [[freezing point]]. This reduces ice production and may stop it altogether.
* '''Latent heat polynya''': is formed through the action of [[katabatic wind]] or [[ocean current]]s which act to drive ice away from a fixed boundary, such as a [[coastline]], [[fast ice]], or an [[ice bridge]]. The polynya forms initially by the first year [[pack ice]] being driven away from the coast, which leaves an area of open water within which new ice is formed. This new ice is then also herded downwind toward the first year pack ice. When it reaches the pack ice the new ice is consolidated onto the pack ice. This process continues over time, thus naming the latent heat polynyas as a major source of sea ice production in the Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skogseth|first=R.|last2=Haugan|first2=P. M.|last3=Haarpaintner|first3=J.|date=2004-10-01|title=Ice and brine production in Storfjorden from four winters of satellite and in situ observations and modeling|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004JC002384/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=109|issue=C10|pages=C10008|doi=10.1029/2004jc002384|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=2004JGRC..10910008S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latent heat polynya is the open water region between the coast and the ice pack.

Latent heat polynyas are regions of high ice production and therefore are possible sites of dense water production in both [[polar region]]s. The high ice production rates within these polynyas leads to a large amount of brine rejection into the surface waters. This salty water then sinks. It is an open question as to whether the polynyas of the [[Arctic]] can produce enough dense water to form a major portion of the dense water required to drive the [[thermohaline circulation]].

== Ecology ==

Some polynyas, such as the [[North Water Polynya]] between [[Canada]] and [[Greenland]] occur seasonally at the same time and place each year. Because animals can adapt their life strategies to this regularity, these types of polynyas are of special ecological research significance. In winter, [[marine mammal]]s such as [[walrus]]es, [[narwhal]]s and [[Beluga (whale)|belugas]] that do not migrate south, remain there. In spring, the thin or absent ice cover allows light in, through the surface layer as soon as the winter night ends, which triggers the early blooming of [[microalgae]] that are at the basis of the marine food chain. So, polynyas are suspected to be places where intense and early production of the [[Zooplankton|planktonic herbivore]]s ensure the transfer of solar energy ([[food chain]]) fixed by planktonic microalgae to [[Arctic cod]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, and [[polar bear]]s. Polar bears are known to be able to swim as far as 65 kilometres across open waters of a polynya.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008 [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 ''Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N.

The presence of polynyas in [[McMurdo Sound]] in the [[Antarctic]] provides an ice-free area where penguins can feed, thus they are important for the survival of the [[Cape Royds]] penguin colony.&lt;ref&gt;

== Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) ==
Antarctic Bottom Water is the dense water with high salinity that exists in the abyssal layer of the [[Southern Ocean]] and it plays a major role in the global overturning circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gregory C.|date=2008-05-01|title=Quantifying Antarctic Bottom Water and North Atlantic Deep Water volumes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JC004477/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=113|issue=C5|pages=C05027|doi=10.1029/2007jc004477|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=2008JGRC..113.5027J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal Polynyas (Latent heat polynyas) are a source of AABW as brine rejection during the formation of sea ice at these polynyas increase the salinity of the sea water which then sinks down to the ocean bottom as AABW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamura|first=Takeshi|last2=Ohshima|first2=Kay I.|last3=Nihashi|first3=Sohey|date=2008-04-01|title=Mapping of sea ice production for Antarctic coastal polynyas|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL032903/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=35|issue=7|pages=L07606|doi=10.1029/2007gl032903|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2008GeoRL..35.7606T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohshima|first=Kay I.|last2=Fukamachi|first2=Yasushi|last3=Williams|first3=Guy D.|last4=Nihashi|first4=Sohey|last5=Roquet|first5=Fabien|last6=Kitade|first6=Yujiro|last7=Tamura|first7=Takeshi|last8=Hirano|first8=Daisuke|last9=Herraiz-Borreguero|first9=Laura|title=Antarctic Bottom Water production by intense sea-ice formation in the Cape Darnley polynya|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1738|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1038/ngeo1738|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..235O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic polynyas form when ice masses diverge from the coast and move away in the direction of the wind; creating an exposed area of sea water which subsequently freezes over, with brine rejection, to form another mass of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohshima|first=Kay I.|last2=Fukamachi|first2=Yasushi|last3=Williams|first3=Guy D.|last4=Nihashi|first4=Sohey|last5=Roquet|first5=Fabien|last6=Kitade|first6=Yujiro|last7=Tamura|first7=Takeshi|last8=Hirano|first8=Daisuke|last9=Herraiz-Borreguero|first9=Laura|title=Antarctic Bottom Water production by intense sea-ice formation in the Cape Darnley polynya|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1738|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1038/ngeo1738|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..235O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When submarines of the U.S. Navy made expeditions to the [[North Pole]] in the 1950s and 60s, there was a significant concern about surfacing through the thick [[pack ice]] of the Arctic Ocean. In 1962, both the [[USS Skate (SSN-578)|USS ''Skate'']] and [[USS Seadragon (SSN-584)|USS ''Seadragon'']] surfaced within the same, large polynya near the [[North Pole]], for the first polar rendezvous of the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] and the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yoEb9xtLv00C ''Tales of a Cold War Submariner''] by Dan Summitt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[geodesy]], '''Receiver Independent Exchange Format''' ('''RINEX''') is a data interchange format for raw [[global navigation satellite system|satellite navigation system]] data. This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result &amp;mdash; usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement.

The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of these quantities are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is interesting to store intermediate measures for later use. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications, whatever the manufacturer of both the receiver and the computer application.

The RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The first RINEX version was published by W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. Since 1993 the RINEX 2 is available, which has been revised and adopted several times. RINEX enables storage of measurements of [[pseudorange]], [[Global_Positioning_System#Carrier_phase_tracking_.28surveying.29|carrier-phase]], [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and signal-to-noise from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] (including [[GPS modernization signals]] e.g. L5 and L2C), [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]], [[Beidou_navigation_satellite_system|Beidou]], along with data from [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service|EGNOS]] and [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]] [[satellite based augmentation system]]s (SBAS), [[QZSS]], simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013 and is capable of new measurements{{what|date=March 2014}} from [[GPS modernization|GPS]] or [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]] systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.03 from July 2015 with update 1 to 3.03 published in 2017.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107"&gt;{{cite web|title=RINEX The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 3.03, Update 1|url=ftp://igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex303_update1.pdf|publisher=International GNSS Service|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not part of the RINEX format, the ''Hatanaka compression scheme '' is commonly used to reduced the size of RINEX files, resulting in an ASCII-based CompactRINEX format.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107" /&gt;. It uses higher-order time differences to reduce the number of characters needed to store time data.&lt;ref name="Hatanaka2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatanaka|first1=Yuki|title=A Compression Format and Tools for GNSS Observation Data|url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000045517.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48004">'''Sustainable cities''', '''urban sustainability''', or '''eco-city''' (also "ecocity") is a city designed with consideration for [[Sustainability|social, economic, environmental impact &lt;ref&gt;Ranasinghe ,WC and Hemakumara, GPTS(2018),  Spatial modelling of the householders' perception and assessment of the potentiality to improve the urban green coverage in residential areas: A case study from Issadeen Town Matara, Sri Lanka, Ruhuna Journal of Science,Vol 9(1); http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174&lt;/ref&gt;]], and resilient habitat for existing populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same. These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimization of required inputs of energy, water, food, waste, output of heat, [[air pollution]] - [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[methane]], and water pollution. Richard Register first coined the term "ecocity" in his 1987 book, ''Eco city Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future''. Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.

There remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.

Ideally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture. However, minimally a sustainable city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside. Secondly, it should be able to power itself with renewable sources of energy. The core of this is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]], while producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All while efficiently using the land; composting used materials, and recycling or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. All of these contributions will lead to the city's overall impacts on [[climate change]] to be minimal and with as little impact. The Adelaide City Council states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, and democratic and provide a good quality of life. 

A sustainable city can feed itself with minimal reliance on the surrounding countryside, and power itself with renewable sources of energy. The crux of this is to create the smallest possible [[ecological footprint]], and to produce the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] possible, to efficiently use land; compost used materials, recycle it or convert waste-to-energy, and thus the city's overall contribution to [[climate change]] will be minimal, if such practices are adhered to. 

It is estimated that over 50% of the world’s population now lives in cities and urban areas. These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. Richard Florida, an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.

Contrary to common belief, urban systems can be more environmentally sustainable than rural or suburban living. With people and resource located so close to one another it is possible to save energy for transportation and mass transit systems, and resources such as food. Cities benefit the economy by locating human capital in one relatively small geographic area where ideas can be generated. Having a more dense, urban space would also increase people's efficiency since they wouldn't have to spend as much time commuting to places if resources are located close together, which in turn would benefit the economy since people can use this extra time on other matters; like work.

==Practical achievement==
These ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:
*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).&lt;!-- British form of 'center' --&gt; This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).
*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. 
*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the "[[heat island effect]]" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&amp;mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.
*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.
*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.
*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Incorporating [[Green roof|eco roofs]] or green roofs in your design will help with air quality, climate and water runoff.
*[[Zero-emission transport]]
*[[Zero-energy building]]
*[[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] or SUDS
*[[Energy conservation|energy conservation systems/devices]]
*[[Xeriscaping]] - garden and landscape design for water conservation
*[[Sustainable transport]], incorporates five elements: fuel economy, occupancy, electrification, pedal power, and urbanization.
*[[Key Performance Indicator|Key Performance Indicators]] - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&amp;V for city administrators
*Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI,Voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.
*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the amount of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.
*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.

== Architecture ==
Buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.

=== Eco-industrial park ===
The purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.

=== Urban farming ===
See also: [[Urban Agriculture]]

[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because "it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in -and interacting with- the urban ecosystem. Such linkages include the use of urban residents as labourers, use of typical urban resources (like organic waste as compost and urban wastewater for irrigation), direct links with urban consumers, direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative), being part of the urban food system, competing for land with other urban functions, being influenced by urban policies and plans, etc." There are many motivations behind urban agriculture, but in the context of creating a sustainable city, this method of food cultivation saves energy in food transportation and saves costs. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.
Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco.

=== Urban infill ===
Many cities are currently in a shift from the suburban sprawl model of development to a return to urban dense living. This shift in geographic distribution of population leads to a denser core of city residents. These residents provide a growing demand in many sectors that is reflected in the architectural fabric of the city. This new demand can be supplied by new construction or historic rehabilitation. Sustainable cities will opt for historical rehabilitation wherever possible. Having people live in higher densities not only gives economies of scale but also allows for infrastructure to be more efficient.

=== Walkable urbanism ===
Walkable urbanism is a development strategy in opposition to suburban sprawl. It advocates housing for a diverse population, a full mix of uses, walkable streets, positive [[public space]], integrated civic and commercial centers, transit orientation and accessible open space. It also advocates for density and accessibility of commercial and government activity.

==== New Urbanism ====
The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.

In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]] promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as opposing solitary [[Housing estate|housing estates]] and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Both trends started in the 1980s.

=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===
Main article: [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System® encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.

LEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations &amp; Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.

=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===
Sustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]], [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.

In SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.

== Transportation ==
As major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city’s reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].

Due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city’s energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world’s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.

The [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.

=== Car free city ===
The concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[Pedestrian area|pedestrian areas]] is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.

=== Emphasis on proximity ===
Created by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.
Transportation in downtown [[Chicago]]
Furthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.

=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===
Sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.

Among the different [[Modes of transport|modes of transportation]], the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[Walking path|walking paths]] remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.

=== Access to transportation ===
In order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.

In order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.

== Urban strategic planning ==
Although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate theses experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Università del Salento and Università degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12–14 October 2016.

=== Development ===
Recently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.

=== Obstacles ===
The City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continual to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.

=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===
According to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authories, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.

==Examples==
===Australia===

==== Adelaide ====
'''Urban forests'''

In [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.

'''Solar power'''

The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.

'''Wind power'''

South Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.

'''Waste recycling'''

For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.

[[Malacca]] has a stated ambition to become a carbon-free city, taking steps towards creating a smart electricity grid. This is being done as part of an initiative to create a Green Special Economic Zone, where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology, creating up to 300,000 new green jobs. 

The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning (FDTCP) in peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of the Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development (MURNInets)MURNInets includes 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under six dimensions. Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities. In MURNInets at least three main new features are introduced. These include the Happiness Index, an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the well-being of the community. Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authorities' services. Through the introduction of these indicators the bottom-up approach in measuring sustainability is adopted.

=== Spain ===

* [[Bilbao]]: The city faced economic turmoil following the decline of the steel and port industries but through communication between stakeholders and authorities to create inner-city transformation, the local government benefited from the increase in land value in old port areas. The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe’s most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.
* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful. By converting roads to spaces for festivals, farmer markets, bikes, and walkability it promotes a healthier lifestyle and potentially a happier one.

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">USBL ('''ultra-short baseline''', also sometimes known as '''SSBL''' for super short base line) is a [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|method of underwater acoustic positioning]]. A complete USBL system consists of a [[transceiver]], which is mounted on a pole under a ship, and a [[Transponder|transponder or responder]] on the seafloor, on a [[towfish]], or on an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]. A computer, or "topside unit", is used to calculate a position from the ranges and bearings measured by the transceiver.

An [[Acoustics|acoustic]] pulse is transmitted by the transceiver and detected by the subsea transponder, which replies with its own acoustic pulse. This return pulse is detected by the shipboard transceiver. The time from the transmission of the initial acoustic pulse until the reply is detected is measured by the USBL system and is converted into a range.

To calculate a subsea position, the USBL calculates both a range and an angle from the transceiver to the [[subsea]] beacon. Angles are measured by the transceiver, which contains an array of [[transducers]]. The transceiver head normally contains three or more transducers separated by a baseline of 10&amp;nbsp;cm or less. A method called “[[Phase difference|phase-differencing]]” within this [[Microphone array|transducer array]] is used to calculate the direction to the subsea transponder.

USBLs have also begun to find use in "inverted" (iUSBL) configurations, with the transceiver mounted on an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]], and the transponder on the target. In this case, the "topside" processing happens inside the vehicle to allow it to locate the transponder for applications such as [[automatic docking]] and [[Tracking system|target tracking]].

'''what3words''' is a [[geocoding]] system for the communication of locations with a resolution of three metres. What3words encodes [[geographic coordinates]] into three dictionary words. For example, the torch of the [[Statue of Liberty]] is located at "toned.melt.ship". This differs from most other location encoding systems in that it displays three words rather than long strings of numbers or letters. What3words has a website, apps for iOS and Android, and an [[API]] that enables bidirectional conversion of what3words address and latitude/longitude coordinates. As the system relies on a fixed algorithm, not a large database of every location on earth, it works on devices with limited storage and no internet connection, and the encoding is permanently fixed and unchangeable.

==History==
Founded by Chris Sheldrick, [[Jack Waley-Cohen]], Mohan Ganesalingam, and Michael Dent, what3words launched in July 2013.&lt;ref name="w3w-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/02/what3words_n_3532121.html|title='What3Words' Wants To Replace Postcodes With Words – For The Entire Globe|date=2 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="w3w-launch-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/08/what3words/|title=Location-Pinpointing Startup what3words Sells 10,000+ OneWord Map-Pins In First Week|date=8 Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="w3w-team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what3words.com/team/|title=what3words team|access-date=9 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldrick and Ganesalingam originally conceived the idea after Sheldrick struggled to get equipment and bands to event locations on time due to inadequate addressing while working as a concert organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://magenta.as/this-app-gives-even-the-most-remote-spots-on-the-planet-an-address-4f09f4bca94e|title=This App Gives Even the Most Remote Spots on the Planet an Address}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was incorporated on March 5, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08430008|title=what3words limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a patent application for the core technology filed on April 19, 2013.&lt;ref name="w3w-patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2014170646|title=WO2014170646 A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING AND COMMUNICATING LOCATIONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, what3words raised $500,000 of seed funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcpost.com/articles/17534/20131106/startup-what3words-gets-usd-500-000-seed-round.htm|title=Startup what3words gets USD 500,000 in seed round|work=Venture Capital Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2014 the company raised a second seed round of $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/20/what3words-1m/|title=Location Pinpointing Startup what3words Adds $1M More To Its Seed To Flog More Map Labels|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/what3words-closes-1m-to-expand-alternative-to-postcodes-mapping-service/|title=what3words closes $1m to expand ‘alternative to postcodes’ mapping service|work=Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcpost.com/articles/22723/20140320/what3words-adds-1m-more-to-seed-round.htm|title=What3words adds $1M more to seed round|work=Venture Capital Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 3, 2015, what3words closed a $3.5 million [[Series A round|Series A]] funding round led by [[Intel Capital]], with [[Li Ka-shing]]'s [[Horizons Ventures]] participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/what3words-series-a/|title=what3words Gets $3.5M Led by Intel Capital To Simplify Location Sharing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 29, 2016, what3words closed a $8.5 million Series B round led by [[Aramex]].&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/29/addressing-platform-what3words-closes-8-5m-series-b-led-by-logistics-firm-aramex/|title=Addressing platform what3words closes $8.5M Series B led by logistics firm Aramex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--?--&gt;
On January 10, 2018, [[Mercedes-Benz]] bought approximately 10% of the company and announced what3words support in future versions of the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX)  infotainment and navigation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/daimler-mercedes-what3words/|title=Why Daimler Invested in a Startup That Has Labeled the World With Unique Three-Word Addresses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A-Class, launched in May 2018, became the first vehicle in the world with what3words on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/bilanz/article175180978/What3words-Diese-Ortungssoftware-gibt-es-bald-serienmaessig-in-Daimlers-A-Klasse.html|title=What3words: Diese Ortungssoftware gibt es bald serienmäßig in Daimlers A-Klasse|first=Michael|last=Brecht|date=5 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.welt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the company announced that Colorado-based [[Steve Coast]], founder of [[OpenStreetMap]], joined the team as Chief Evangelist, charged with developing and strengthening partnerships in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wallace |first1=Anthony |title=Founder of OpenStreetMap joins what3words |url=https://www.spatialsource.com.au/latest-news/founder-of-openstreetmap-joins-what3words |website=Spatial Source |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=what3words hires Steve Coast, founder of OpenStreetMap {{!}} GeoConnexion |url=https://www.geoconnexion.com/news/what3words-hires-steve-coast-founder-of-openstreetmap |website=www.geoconnexion.com |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coast has since moved on.

==Design principles==
what3words uses a grid of the world made up of 57 trillion squares of 3 metres by 3 metres. Each square has been given a three-word English address. What3words has named the world's landmass with three words in various other languages. {{As of|2016|12}}, what3words addresses (as well as web and iOS app user interface) are available in Arabic, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Mongolian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish; the iOS app also supports Swahili. What3words launched 12 more languages at the start of 2018: Indonesian, Zulu, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccafeng/2016/06/11/new-company-aims-to-give-billions-of-people-one-thing-they-dont-have-an-address/|title=Startup What3words Aims To Give Billions Of People One Thing They Don't Have: An Address|first=Rebecca|last=Feng|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also mentioned Chinese and various languages of Pakistan, including Urdu and Farsi.&lt;ref name="w3w-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3w.co/about|title=About |publisher=what3words}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/249560/what3words-co-founder-chris-sheldrick-explains-his-company|title=Meet What3Words: The London startup changing our understanding of location|first=Harriet|last=Green|date=19 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/story/GN_06072016_070713/|title=Mapping the world in three words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-try-to-put-remote-e-commerce-customers-on-the-map-1468603499|title=Startups Try to Put Remote E-Commerce Customers on the Map|first=Erica E.|last=Phillips|date=15 July 2016|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each what3words language uses a wordlist of 25,000 words (40,000 in English, as it covers the sea as well as land). The lists go through multiple automated and human processes before being sorted by an algorithm that takes into account word length, distinctiveness, frequency, and ease of spelling and pronunciation. [[Homophones]] and [[variant spellings]] are treated to minimize any potential for confusion, and offensive words are removed.&lt;ref name="w3w-about"/&gt;

The what3words algorithm actively shuffles similar-sounding three-word combinations around the world to enable both human and automated error-checking. The result is that if a three-word combination is entered slightly incorrectly and the result is still a valid what3words reference, the location will usually be so far away from the user's intended area that it will be immediately obvious to both a user and an intelligent error-checking system.&lt;ref name="w3w-about"/&gt;

The what3words system uses a proprietary [[algorithm]] in combination with a limited database, meaning that the core technology is contained within a file around 10&amp;nbsp;MB in size. The database is used to assign more memorable words to locations in urban areas.&lt;ref name="w3w-patent"/&gt; what3words originally sold "OneWord" addresses, which were stored in a database for a yearly fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/08/what3words/|title=Location-Pinpointing Startup what3words Sells 10,000+ OneWord Map-Pins In First Week|date=8 Jul 2013|website=TechCrunch|last=Lomas|first=Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this feature has been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/what3words/status/594070034625986561|title=what3words on Twitter: "we did charge for that functionality but no longer offer it."|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main claimed advantages of what3words are memorability, error-detection, unambiguous nature of words for most everyday and non-technical uses and voice input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/the-wiki-man/9348462/the-best-navigation-idea-ive-seen-since-the-tube-map/|title=The best navigation idea I've seen since the Tube map|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A comparison of immediate memory span for digits, letters, and words |last=Crannell |first=C.

==Critiques ==
Supporters of open standards denounce the what3words system for being controlled by a private business and the software for being copyrighted and thus not freely usable. The fact that similar addresses are purposely far away from each other is also seen by some as a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2016/06/30/what-words-quite-find/143z4Pnov2aP7gmBzWuxEK/story.html|title=What3Words is quite a find|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=1 Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ldodds.com/2016/06/14/what-3-words-jog-on-mate/|title=What 3 Words?
