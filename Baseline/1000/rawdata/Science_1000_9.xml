'''Aperiodic frequency''' is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of incidence or occurrence of non-[[Periodic function|cyclic]] phenomena, including random processes such as [[radioactive decay]]. It is expressed in [[units of measurement]] of [[reciprocal seconds]] (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=3UGQsi6VamwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mechatronic Systems, Sensors, and Actuators: Fundamentals and Modeling|last=Lombardi|first=Michael A.|date=2017-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9781420009002|editor-last=Bishop|editor-first=Robert H.|location=Austin|pages=18-1|language=en|chapter=Fundamentals of Time and Frequency}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of radioactivity, [[becquerels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Units with special names and symbols; units that incorporate special names and symbols|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-2.html|journal=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI)|edition=8th|volume=Section 2.2.2|pages=|via=|Section=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artificial gravity''' (sometimes referred to as '''pseudogravity''') is the creation of an [[inertial force]] that mimics the effects of a [[Gravity|gravitational]] force, usually by [[Circular motion|rotation]].&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"&gt;https://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%202/sg22/sg22finalreportr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artificial gravity, or '''rotational gravity''', is thus the appearance of a [[centrifugal force]] in a [[rotating frame of reference]] (the transmission of [[centripetal acceleration]] via [[normal force]] in the non-rotating frame of reference), as opposed to the force experienced in [[linear acceleration]], which by the [[equivalence principle]] is indistinguishable from gravity.
In a more general sense, "artificial gravity" may also refer to the effect of linear acceleration, e.g. by means of a [[rocket engine]]..&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; 

Rotational simulated gravity has been used in simulations to help astronauts train for extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18619137 | volume=79 | title=Space medicine at the NASA-JSC, neutral buoyancy laboratory | date=July 2008 | journal=Aviat Space Environ Med | pages=732–3 | author=Strauss S}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rotational simulated gravity  has been proposed as a solution in [[manned spaceflight]] to the adverse [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|health effects caused by prolonged weightlessness]]. 
However, there are no current practical outer space applications of artificial gravity for humans due to concerns about the size and cost of a spacecraft necessary to produce a useful [[centripetal acceleration]] comparable to the gravitational field strength on Earth (g).&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a8965/why-dont-we-have-artificial-gravity-15425569/|title=Why Don't We Have Artificial Gravity?|author=|date=May 3, 2013|website=popularmechanics.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centrifugal==
{{see|Absolute rotation|Bucket argument}}
[[File:Artificial Gravity Space Station - GPN-2003-00104.jpg|thumb|Artificial gravity space station. 1969 NASA concept. This design is flawed because the astronauts would be walking back and forth between gravity and weightlessness.]]
Artificial gravity can be created using a [[centripetal force]]. A centripetal force directed towards the center of the turn is required for any object to move in a circular path.  
In the context of a rotating space station it is the [[normal force]] provided by spacecraft's hull that acts as centripetal force. Thus, the "gravity" force felt by an object the [[centrifugal force]] perceived in the [[rotating frame of reference]] as pointing "downwards" towards the hull.
In accordance with [[Newton's Third Law]] the value of [[Little g|little ''g'']] (the perceived "downward" acceleration) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
to the centripetal acceleration.

===Mechanism===
[[Image:ArtificialGravity.gif|right|thumb|Balls in a rotating spacecraft]]
From the [[rotating reference frame|point of view of people rotating with the habitat]], artificial gravity by rotation behaves in some ways similarly to normal gravity but with the following differences:
* [[Centripetal force]]: Unlike real gravity, which pulls towards a center of the planet, the centripetal force pushes towards the axis of rotation. For a given angular velocity the amount of artificial gravity depends linearly on the radius. With a small radius of rotation, the amount of gravity felt at one's head would be significantly different from the amount felt at one's feet. This could make movement and changing body position awkward. In accordance with the [[Centripetal force#Formula|physics involved]], slower rotations or larger rotational radii would reduce or eliminate this problem. Similarly the linear velocity of the habitat should be significantly higher than the relative velocities with which an astronaut will change position within it. Otherwise moving in the direction of the rotation will increase the felt gravity (while moving in the opposite direction will decrease it) to the point that it should cause problems.
* The [[Coriolis effect]] gives an apparent force that acts on objects that move relative to a rotating reference frame. This apparent force acts at right angles to the motion and the rotation axis and tends to curve the motion in the opposite sense to the habitat's spin. If an [[astronaut]] inside a rotating artificial gravity environment moves towards or away from the axis of rotation, he or she will feel a force pushing him or her towards or away from the direction of spin. These forces act on the inner ear and can cause [[dizziness]], [[nausea]] and disorientation. Lengthening the period of rotation (slower spin rate) reduces the Coriolis force and its effects. It is generally believed that at 2 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] or less, no adverse effects from the Coriolis forces will occur, although humans have been shown to adapt to rates as high as 23 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].&lt;ref name=hecht2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ESASP.501..151H |title=Adapting to artificial gravity (AG) at high rotational speeds |author=Hecht, H. |author2=Brown, E. L. |author3=Young, L. R. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Proceedings of "Life in space for life on Earth". 8th European Symposium on Life Sciences Research in Space. 23rd Annual International Gravitational Physiology Meeting |date=June 2–7, 2002 |accessdate=2011-02-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not yet known whether very long exposures to high levels of Coriolis forces can increase the likelihood of becoming accustomed. The nausea-inducing effects of Coriolis forces can also be mitigated by restraining movement of the head.

This form of artificial gravity has additional engineering issues:
* Kinetic energy and [[angular momentum]]: Spinning up (or down) parts or all of the habitat requires energy, while angular momentum must be conserved. This would require a propulsion system and expendable propellant, or could be achieved without expending mass, by an [[electric motor]] and a counterweight, such as a [[reaction wheel]] or possibly another living area spinning in the opposite direction.
* Extra strength is needed in the structure to keep it from flying apart because of the rotation. However, the amount of structure needed over and above that to hold a breathable atmosphere (10 tons force per square meter at 1 atmosphere) is relatively modest for most structures.
* If parts of the structure are intentionally not spinning, [[friction]] and similar [[torque]]s will cause the rates of spin to converge (as well as causing the otherwise stationary parts to spin), requiring motors and power to be used to compensate for the losses due to friction.
* A traversable interface between parts of the station spinning relative to each other requires large vacuum-tight axial seals.

===Manned spaceflight===
The engineering challenges of creating a rotating spacecraft are comparatively modest to any other proposed approach.{{original research inline|date=February 2016}} Theoretical spacecraft designs using artificial gravity have a great number of variants with intrinsic problems and advantages. The formula for the [[centripetal force#Formula|centripetal force]] implies that the radius of rotation grows with the square of the rotating spacecraft period, so a doubling of the period requires a fourfold increase in the radius of rotation. For example, to produce [[standard gravity]], {{math|''ɡ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}} with a rotating spacecraft period of 15&amp;nbsp;s, the radius of rotation would have to be {{convert|56|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while a period of 30&amp;nbsp;s would require it to be {{convert|224|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To reduce mass, the support along the diameter could consist of nothing but a cable connecting two sections of the spaceship. Among the possible solutions include a habitat module and a counterweight consisting of every other part of the spacecraft, alternatively two habitatable modules of similar weight could be attached to one another.

Whatever design is chosen, it would be necessary for the spacecraft to possess some means to quickly transfer [[ballast]] from one section to another, otherwise even small shifts in mass could cause a substantial shift in the spacecraft's axis, which would result in a dangerous "wobble." One possible solution would be to engineer the spacecraft's plumbing system to serve this purpose, using drinking [[water]] and/or waste water as the ballast. 

It is not yet known whether exposure to high gravity for short periods of time is as beneficial to health as continuous exposure to normal gravity. It is also not known how effective low levels of gravity would be at countering the adverse effects on health of weightlessness. Artificial gravity at 0.1''g'' and a rotating spacecraft period of 30&amp;nbsp;s would require a radius of only {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Likewise, at a radius of 10&amp;nbsp;m, a period of just over 6&amp;nbsp;s would be required to produce standard gravity (at the hips; gravity would be 11% higher at the feet), while 4.5&amp;nbsp;s would produce 2''g''. If brief exposure to high gravity can negate the harmful effects of weightlessness, then a small centrifuge could be used as an exercise area.

====Gemini missions====
The [[Gemini 11]] mission attempted to produce artificial gravity by rotating the capsule around the [[Agena Target Vehicle]] to which it was attached by a 36-meter tether. They were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of [[bolas]].&lt;ref name="Gatland1976"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kenneth|last=Gatland|title=Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision|place=New York, NY, USA|publisher=MacMillan|year=1976|pages=180–182|isbn=0-02-542820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resultant force was too small to be felt by either astronaut, but objects were observed moving towards the "floor" of the capsule.&lt;ref name="Clément G 2007"&gt;Clément G, Bukley A (2007) Artificial Gravity. Springer: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be pointed out that the [[Gemini 8]] mission achieved artificial gravity for a few minutes. This, however, was due to an accident. The acceleration forces upon the crew were so high (~ 4g's) that the mission had to be urgently terminated.

==== Health benefits ====
[[File:Jsc2004e18862.jpg|thumb|Artificial gravity has been suggested for interplanetary journey to Mars]]
Artificial gravity has been suggested as a solution to the various health risks associated with spaceflight.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/26136665/|title=Artificial Gravity as a Countermeasure for Mitigating Physiological Deconditioning During Long-Duration Space Missions|author=|date= June 17, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the [[Soviet]] space program believed that a human could not survive more than 14 days in space due to a fear that the [[heart]] and [[blood vessels]] would be unable to adapt to the weightless conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3947769|title=Weightlessness Obstacle to Space Survival|author=|date=April 4, 1964|publisher=|journal=The Science News-Letter|volume=86|issue=7|pages=103–103|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear was eventually discovered to be unfounded as spaceflights have now lasted up to 438 consecutive days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/24/525374569/astronaut-peggy-whitson-sets-new-nasa-record-for-most-days-in-space|title=Astronaut Peggy Whitson Sets NASA Record For Most Days In Space|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with missions aboard the international space station commonly lasting 6 months. However, the question of human safety in space did launch an investigation into the physical effects of prolonged exposure to weightlessness. In June 1991, a [[NASA|Spacelab Life Sciences]] 1 flight performed 18 experiments on two men and two women over a period of nine days. In an environment without gravity, it was concluded that the response of [[white blood cells]] and [[muscle]] mass decreased. Additionally, within the first 24 hours spent in a weightless environment, [[blood volume]] decreased by 10%.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1311819|title=Artificial Gravity and Space Travel|first=Leonard|last=David|date=April 4, 1992|publisher=|journal=BioScience|volume=42|issue=3|pages=155–159|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1311819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; Upon return to earth, the effects of prolonged weightlessness continue to affect the human body as fluids pool back to the lower body, the [[heart rate]] rises, a drop in [[blood pressure]] occurs and there is a reduced ability to [[exercise]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Artificial gravity, due to its ability to [[mimic]] the behavior of gravity on the human body has been suggested as one of the most encompassing manners of combating the [[physical effects]] inherent with weightless environments. Other measures that have been suggested as symptomatic treatments include exercise, diet and [[Pingvin exercise suit|penguin suits]]. However, criticism of those methods lays in the fact that they do not fully eliminate the health problems and require a variety of solutions to address all issues. Artificial gravity, in contrast, would remove the weightlessness inherent with space travel. By implementing artificial gravity, space travelers would never have to experience weightlessness or the associated side effects.&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt; Especially in a modern-day six-month journey to [[Mars]], exposure to artificial gravity is suggested in either a continuous or intermittent form to prevent extreme debilitation to the astronauts during travel.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

====Proposals====

A number of proposals have incorporated artificial gravity into their design:

The [[torus|torus-ring]] [[centrifuge]] would utilize both standard metal-frame and [[Inflatable space habitat|inflatable]] spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to {{nowrap|0.69[[Standard gravity|g]]}} if built with the {{convert|40|ft}} diameter option.&lt;ref name=fiso20110126b&gt;

The "Mars Habitat Unit", which would carry astronauts to Mars to join the previously-launched "Earth Return Vehicle", would have had artificial gravity generated during flight by tying the spent upper stage of the booster to the Habitat Unit, and setting them both rotating about a common axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nss.org/resources/books/non_fiction/NF_037_caseformars.html|title=NSS Review:  The Case for Mars|author=|date=|website=www.nss.org|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]] was a proposed mission meant to study the effect of artificial gravity on mammals. An artificial gravity field of 0.38 ''g'' (equivalent to [[Mars]]'s surface gravity) was to be produced by rotation (32 rpm, radius of ca. 30&amp;nbsp;cm). Fifteen mice would have orbited Earth ([[Low Earth orbit]]) for five weeks and then land alive.&lt;ref&gt;https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/26717/IAC-07-A1.9.-A2.7.05.pdf;jsessionid=4843BF9FDBB666BB08C17774A914FE01.smartech?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; However, the program was canceled on 24 June 2009, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=31612|title=The Mars Gravity Biosatellite Program Is Closing Down|author=|date=|website=www.spaceref.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Issues with implementation ====
Some of the reasons that artificial gravity remains unused today in [[spaceflight]] trace back to the problems inherent in [[implementation]]. One of the realistic methods of creating artificial gravity is a [[centripetal force]] pulling a person towards a relative floor. In that model, however, issues arise in the size of the spacecraft. As expressed by John Page and Matthew Francis, the smaller a spacecraft, the more rapid the rotation that is required. As such, to simulate gravity, it would be more ideal to utilize a larger spacecraft that rotates very slowly. The requirements on size in comparison to rotation are due to the different magnitude of forces the body can experience if the rotation is too tight. Additionally, questions remain as to what the best way to initially set the rotating motion in place without disturbing the stability of the whole spacecraft's orbit. At the moment, there is not a ship massive enough to meet the rotation requirements, and the costs associated with building, maintaining, and [[launching]] such a craft are extensive.&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com"/&gt;

In general, with the limited health effects present in shorter spaceflights, as well as the high cost of [[research]], application of artificial gravity is often stunted and [[sporadic]].&lt;ref name="iaaweb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

====In science fiction====
{{main|Artificial_gravity_(fiction)#Rotational_gravity}}
Several science fiction novels, films and series have featured artificial gravity production. In the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], a rotating centrifuge in the ''Discovery'' spacecraft provides artificial gravity. 
In the novel [[The Martian (Weir novel)|''The Martian'']], the ''Hermes'' spacecraft achieves artificial gravity by design; it employs a ringed structure, at whose periphery forces around 40% of Earth's gravity are experienced, similar to Mars's gravity. The movie [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']] features a spacecraft called the ''Endurance'' that can rotate on its center axis to create artificial gravity, controlled by retro thrusters on the ship.

[[High-G training]] is done by aviators and astronauts who are subject to high levels of acceleration ('G') in large-radius centrifuges. It is designed to prevent a ''g-induced loss Of consciousness'' (abbreviated [[G-LOC]]), a situation when [[g-force#Human g-force experience|''g''-forces]] move the blood away from the brain to the extent that [[consciousness]] is lost. Incidents of acceleration-induced loss of consciousness have caused fatal accidents in aircraft capable of sustaining high-''g'' for considerable periods.

In [[amusement park]]s, [[pendulum ride]]s and [[centrifuge]]s provide rotational force. [[Roller coaster]]s also do, whenever they go over dips, humps, or loops. When going over a hill, time in which zero or negative gravity is felt is called [[air time (rides)|air time]], or "airtime", which can be divided into "floater air time" (for zero gravity) and "ejector air time" (for negative gravity).{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}

==Linear acceleration==
{{see|Equivalence principle}}
Linear acceleration, even at a low level, can provide sufficient [[g-force]] to provide useful benefits. A spacecraft under constant acceleration in a straight line would give the appearance of a gravitational pull in the direction opposite of the acceleration. This "pull" that would cause a loose object to "fall" towards the hull of the spacecraft is actually a manifestation of the inertia of the objects inside the spacecraft, in accordance with [[Newton's first law]]. 
Further, the "gravity" felt by an object pressed against the hull of the spacecraft is simply the reaction force of the object on the hull reacting to the acceleration force of the hull on the object, in accordance with Newton's Third Law and somewhat similar to the effect on an object pressed against the hull of a spacecraft rotating as outlined above. Unlike an artificial gravity based on rotation, linear acceleration gives the appearance of a gravity field which is both uniform throughout the spacecraft and without the disadvantage of additional fictitious forces.

Some [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemical]] [[Spacecraft propulsion#Reaction engines|reaction rockets]] can at least temporarily provide enough acceleration to overcome Earth's gravity and could thus provide linear acceleration to emulate Earth's g-force. However, since all such rockets provide this acceleration by expelling [[reaction mass]] such an acceleration would only be temporary, until the limited supply of rocket fuel had been spent.

Nevertheless, constant linear acceleration is desirable since in addition to providing artificial gravity it could theoretically provide relatively short flight times around the solar system. For example, if a propulsion technique able to support 1''g'' of acceleration continuously were available, a spaceship accelerating (and then decelerating for the second half of the journey) at 1''g'' would reach [[Mars]] within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Gravity|first1=Gilles|last1=Clément|first2=Angelia P.|last2=Bukley|publisher=Springer New York|year=2007|isbn=0-387-70712-3|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUcjOsG0hi0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YUcjOsG0hi0C&amp;pg=PA35 Extract of page 35]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a hypothetical [[space travel using constant acceleration]] of 1''g'' for one year would reach [[relativistic speed]]s and allow for a round trip to the nearest star, [[Proxima Centauri]].

As such, low-impulse but long-term linear acceleration has been proposed for various interplanetary missions. For example, even heavy (100 [[ton]]) cargo payloads to Mars could be transported to Mars in {{nowrap|27 months}} and retain approximately 55 percent of the [[low Earth orbit|LEO]] vehicle mass upon arrival into a Mars orbit, providing a low-gravity gradient to the spacecraft during the entire journey.&lt;ref name=fiso20110119&gt;[http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Glover_1-19-11/Glover_1-19-11.pdf VASIMR VX-200 Performance and Near-term SEP Capability for Unmanned Mars Flight], Tim Glover, Future in Space Operations (FISO) Colloquium, pp. 22, 25, 2011-01-19. Retrieved 2011-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

A propulsion system with a very high [[specific impulse]] (that is, good efficiency in the use of [[reaction mass]] that must be carried along and used for propulsion on the journey) could accelerate more slowly producing useful levels of artificial gravity for long periods of time. A variety of [[Spacecraft propulsion#Electromagnetic propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems provide examples. Two examples of this long-duration, [[thrust-to-weight ratio|low-thrust]], high-impulse propulsion that have either been practically used on spacecraft or are planned in for near-term in-space use are [[Hall effect thruster]]s and [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]]s (VASIMR). Both provide very high [[specific impulse]] but relatively low thrust, compared to the more typical chemical reaction rockets. They are thus ideally suited for long-duration firings which would provide limited amounts of, but long-term, milli-g levels of artificial gravity in spacecraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In a number of science fiction plots, acceleration is used to produce artificial gravity for [[Interstellar travel|interstellar]] spacecraft, propelled by as yet [[theoretical]] or [[Spacecraft propulsion#Hypothetical methods|hypothetical]] means.

This effect of linear acceleration is well understood, and is routinely used for 0''g'' cryogenic fluid management for post-launch (subsequent) in-space firings of [[upper stage]] rockets.&lt;ref name=goff2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf|title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots|author=Jon Goff|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|year=2009|accessdate=2011-02-07|quote=''Developing techniques for manipulating fluids in microgravity, which typically fall into the category known as settled propellant handling.

The simplest and most mature settling technique is to apply thrust to the spacecraft, forcing the liquid to settle against one end of the tank.''|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roller coaster]]s, especially [[launched roller coasters]] or those that rely on [[electromagnetic propulsion]], can provide linear acceleration "gravity", and so can relatively high acceleration vehicles, such as [[sports car]]s. Linear acceleration can be used to provide [[air-time]] on roller coasters and other thrill rides.

===Diamagnetism===
[[File:Frog diamagnetic levitation.jpg|thumb|A live frog levitates inside a 32 mm [[diameter]] vertical bore of a [[Bitter solenoid]] in a magnetic field of about 16 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]].]]
A similar effect to gravity can be created through [[diamagnetism]]. It requires magnets with extremely powerful magnetic fields. Such devices have been able to levitate at most a small mouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE58A02G20090911|work=Reuters|title=U.S. scientists levitate mice to study low gravity|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a 1 ''g'' field to cancel that of the Earth's. 

Sufficiently powerful magnets require either expensive [[cryogenics]] to keep them [[Superconductivity|superconductive]] or several megawatts of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfml.ru.nl/20t-magnet.html |title=20 tesla Bitter solenoid – Archived link |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320120553/http://www.hfml.ru.nl/20t-magnet.html |archivedate=March 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With such extremely strong magnetic fields, safety for use with humans is unclear.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In addition, it would involve avoiding any [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] materials near the strong magnetic field that is required for diamagnetism to be evident.

Facilities using diamagnetism may prove workable for laboratories simulating low gravity conditions here on Earth.{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} A mouse has been levitated against Earth's gravity, creating a condition similar to [[microgravity]]. Lower forces may also be generated to simulate a condition similar to lunar or Martian gravity with small [[model organism]]s.

===Parabolic flight===
{{main|Vomit Comet}}
''Weightless Wonder'' is the nickname for the NASA aircraft that flies parabolic trajectories and briefly provides a nearly weightless environment in which to train [[astronaut]]s, conduct research, and film motion pictures. The parabolic trajectory creates a vertical linear acceleration which matches that of gravity, giving [[zero-g]] for a short time, usually 20–30 seconds, followed by approximately 1.8g for a similar period. The nickname [[Vomit Comet]] is also used to refer to motion sickness that is often experienced by the aircraft passengers during these parabolic trajectories. Such [[reduced gravity aircraft]] are nowadays operated by several organizations worldwide.

===Neutral buoyancy===
{{main|Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory}}
A '''Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory''' (NBL) is an [[astronaut]] training facility, such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility at the [[NASA Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strauss, S.|title=Space medicine at the NASA-JSC, neutral buoyancy laboratory|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=79|issue=7|pages=732–3|date=July 2008|pmid=18619137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBL is a large indoor pool of water, the largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/nbl/facilities.html|title=Behind the scenes training|publisher=NASA|date=30 May 2003|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which astronauts may perform simulated [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] tasks in preparation for space missions. The NBL contains full-sized mock-ups of the [[Space Shuttle]] cargo bay, flight payloads, and the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name="pmid15892545"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strauss, S.|author2=Krog, R.L.|author3=Feiveson, A.H.|title=Extravehicular mobility unit training and astronaut injuries|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=76|issue=5|pages=469–74|date=May 2005|pmid=15892545|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000005/art00008|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of [[neutral buoyancy]] is used to simulate the weightless environment of space.&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"/&gt; The suited astronauts are lowered into the pool using an [[overhead crane]] and their weight is adjusted by support divers so that they experience no [[buoyancy|buoyant]] force and no [[Moment (physics)|rotational moment]] about their [[center of mass]].&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"/&gt; The suits worn in the NBL are down-rated from fully flight-rated [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]] suits like those in use on the space shuttle and International Space Station.

The NBL tank is {{convert|202|ft|m}} in length, {{convert|102|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|40|ft|6|in|m}} deep, and contains 6.2 million gallons (23.5 million litres) of water.&lt;ref name="pmid15892545"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBL Characteristics |work=About the NBL |publisher=NASA |date=June 23, 2005 |url=http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/about/index.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626165503/http://dx12.jsc.nasa.gov/about/index.shtml |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Divers breathe [[nitrox]] while working in the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths|journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=30|issue=Supplement|year=2003|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/1273|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=74|issue=7|pages=763–7|date=July 2003|pmid=12862332|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000007/art00011|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutral buoyancy in a pool is not [[weightlessness]], since the balance organs in the inner ear still sense the up-down direction of gravity. Also, there is a significant amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]] presented by water.&lt;ref name="pmid15796314"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pendergast D, Mollendorf J, Zamparo P, Termin A, Bushnell D, Paschke D |title=The influence of drag on human locomotion in water|journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=32|issue=1|pages=45–57|year=2005|pmid=15796314|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4037|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another difference between neutral buoyancy simulation in a pool and actual EVA during spaceflight is that the temperature of the pool and the lighting conditions are maintained constant.

==Speculative or fictional mechanisms==
{{Main|Artificial gravity (fiction)|Gravitational shielding|Anti-gravity}}

In science fiction, artificial gravity (or cancellation of gravity) or "paragravity"&lt;ref&gt;''Collision Orbit'', 1942 by [[Jack Williamson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]: A Vision of the Human Future in Space'' by [[Carl Sagan]], Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes present in spacecraft that are neither rotating nor accelerating. At present, there is no confirmed technique that can simulate gravity other than actual mass or acceleration. There have been many claims over the years of such a device. [[Eugene Podkletnov]], a Russian engineer, has claimed since the early 1990s to have made such a device consisting of a spinning superconductor producing a powerful "[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] field", but there has been no verification or even negative results from third parties. In 2006, a research group funded by [[European Space Agency|ESA]] claimed to have created a similar device that demonstrated positive results for the production of gravitomagnetism, although it produced only 0.0001''g''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsp.esa.int/article-view/-/wcl/Fd1ZihgaGrwB/10192/towards-a-new-test-of-general-relativity-|title=Toward a new test of general relativity?|publisher=Esa.int|accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result has not been replicated. [[String theory]] predicts that gravity and electromagnetism unify in hidden dimensions and that extremely short photons can enter those dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Brian, ''[[The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]]. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|author=[[NASA]]|format=PDF| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926023336/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf| archivedate= September 26, 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |title=Former astronaut visits USU |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman |year=2005 |author=Marie MacKay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175913/http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

==Terminology==
{{See also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}

In 1959, when both the United States and [[Soviet Union]] were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, [[NASA]] Administrator [[T. Keith Glennan]] and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden]], discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called ''astronauts'' or ''cosmonauts''. Dryden preferred "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in the ''cosmos'' (near space), while the "astro" prefix suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA [[Space Task Group]] members preferred "astronaut", which survived by common usage as the preferred American term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dethloff | first=Henry C. | title=Suddenly Tomorrow Came... A History of the Johnson Space Center| publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration | year=1993 | authorlink= Henry C. Dethloff | pages=23–24| chapter=Chapter 2: The Commitment to Space| isbn=978-1502753588 | url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/suddenly_tomorrow/suddenly.htm | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961, they chose a term which [[Anglicization|anglicizes]] to "cosmonaut".

===English===
In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54|title=TheSpaceRace.com - Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology|publisher=|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105031754/http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54#|archive-date=January 5, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his 1930 short story "The Death's Head Meteor". The word itself had been known earlier; for example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) by [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by "aeronaut", an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists. An early use of "astronaut" in a non-fiction publication is [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s poem "The Astronaut", appearing in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the [[British Interplanetary Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950, and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.&lt;ref name="IAFpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF History |publisher=[[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date=August 16, 2010 |url=http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102624/https://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name="biopage"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes |first = Kim – NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]], NASA |date = December 15, 2005|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = March 6, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307132816/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| archivedate= March 7, 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its [[European Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name="ESApage"&gt;{{cite web | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = April 10, 2008|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = December 28, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054618/http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| archivedate= December 20, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.&lt;ref name="biopage"/&gt; The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космонавт}}, {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft}}), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler,&lt;ref name = "space traveller"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Kotlyakov| first1 = Vladimir| last2 = Komarova| first2 = Anna| title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6DhWw_cYLicC| year = 2006| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-048878-3 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning "universe", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". Other countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] use variations of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'', such as the [[Poland|Polish]] ''kosmonauta''.

Coinage of the term ''kosmonavt'' has been credited to Soviet aeronautics pioneer [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] (1900–1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brzezinski |first=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Brzezinski |year=2007 |title=Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age |url= |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |page=108 |isbn=978-0-8050-8147-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gruntman |first=Mike |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XY9KXxF8OEC&amp;pg=PA326 |location=Reston, VA |publisher=[[AIAA]] |page=326 |isbn=9781563477058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cosmonaut was [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot [[Yuri Gagarin]], also the first person in space. [[Valentina Tereshkova]], a Russian factory worker, was the first woman in space, as well as the first civilian among the Soviet cosmonaut or NASA astronaut corps to make a spaceflight. On March 14, 1995, [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".

===Other terms===
With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term "[[spaceflight participant]]" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word ''spatium'' for "space", the [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''angkasawan'' was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]], and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] hope to launch a [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle|spacecraft]] in 2022 that would carry ''[[Indian human spaceflight programme#Terminology|vyomanauts]]'', coined from the [[Sanskrit]] word for space. In [[Finland]], the NASA astronaut [[Timothy Kopra]], a [[Finnish Americans|Finnish American]], has sometimes been referred to as ''sisunautti'', from the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''[[sisu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Sisunautti" haaveilee uudesta Suomen-matkasta | publisher = [[MTV3]] |author=MTV Uutiset |date = November 1, 2009|url = https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/artikkeli/sisunautti-haaveilee-uudesta-suomen-matkasta/2174370#gs.XWGxvao| accessdate = April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first human in space was Soviet [[Yuri Gagarin]], who was launched on April 12, 1961, aboard [[Vostok 1]] and orbited around the Earth for 108 minutes. The first woman in space was Soviet [[Valentina Tereshkova]], who launched on June 16, 1963, aboard [[Vostok 6]] and orbited Earth for almost three days.

[[Alan Shepard]] became the first American and second person in space on May 5, 1961, on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight. The first American to orbit the Earth was [[John Glenn]], aboard [[Friendship 7]] on February 20, 1962. The first American woman in space was [[Sally Ride]], during [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]'s mission [[STS-7]], on June 18, 1983.&lt;ref name="ride1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html|title=Sally K.

Cosmonaut [[Alexei Leonov]] was the first person to conduct an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), (commonly called a "spacewalk"), on March 18, 1965, on the Soviet Union's Voskhod 2 mission.  This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] who made the first American EVA on NASA's Gemini 4 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Going_Out.html|title=Educator Features: Going Out for a Walk|work=NASA|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first manned mission to orbit the Moon, ''[[Apollo 8]]'', included American [[William Anders]] who was born in Hong Kong, making him the first Asian-born astronaut in 1968.

The Soviet Union, through its [[Intercosmos]] program, allowed people from other "[[socialism|socialist]]" (i.e. [[Warsaw Pact]] and other Soviet-allied) countries to fly on its missions, with the notable exception of [[France]] participating in [[Soyuz TM-7]]. An example is [[Czechoslovak]] [[Vladimír Remek]], the first cosmonaut from a country other than the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union]] or the [[NASA|United States]], who flew to space in 1978 on a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm|title=Vladimir Remek Czech Pilot Cosmonaut|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2007|author=Encyclopedia Astronautica| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100622/http://astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm| archivedate= October 13, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration and distance milestones===
438 days is the longest time spent in space, by Russian [[Valeri Polyakov]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;
As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was {{convert|401056|km|0|abbr=on}}, when [[Jim Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] went around the Moon during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

===Civilian and non-government milestones===
The first civilian in space was [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name="Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |title=Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423074712/http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |archivedate=April 23, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard [[Vostok 6]] (she also became the first woman in space on that mission).
Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which did not accept female pilots at that time. A month later, [[Joseph Albert Walker]] became the first American civilian in space when his [[X-15 Flight 90]] crossed the {{convert|100|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} line, qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight.&lt;ref name="Civilians in Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com Joseph A Walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. 
The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both [[Konstantin Feoktistov]] and [[Boris Yegorov]] aboard [[Voskhod 1]].

Selection was initially limited to military pilots.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970215192726/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 15, 1997 |title=Selection and Training of Astronauts |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=1995 |author=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nolen"&gt;{{cite book| last = Nolen| first = Stephanie| title = Promised The Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race| year = 2002| publisher = Penguin Canada| location = Toronto| isbn = 0-14-301347-5| page = 235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest astronauts for both America and the USSR tended to be [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]] pilots, and were often test pilots.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extravehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="training"/&gt; Astronauts-in-training (astronaut candidates) may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] ([[Micro-g environment|microgravity]]) in an aircraft called the "[[Vomit Comet]]," the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[Parabola|parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name="comet"/&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

Astronauts is training must learn how to control and fly the Space Shuttle and, it is vital that they are familiar with the International Space Station so they know what they must do when they get there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html|title=NASA - Astronauts in Training|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Denise Miller: MSFC|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last decade, flight surgeons and scientists at NASA have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions. The syndrome, known as visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the [[brain]] have been found in astronauts who have taken [[Human spaceflight|trips in space]], based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies]]. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes.&lt;ref name="NEJM-20171102"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberts, Donna R. et al. |title=Effects of Spaceflight on Astronaut Brain Structure as Indicated on MRI |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |date=2 November 2017 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=377 |pages=1746–1753 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |accessdate=4 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107151313/http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QTZ-20171103"&gt;{{cite web |last=Foley |first=Katherine Ellen |title=Astronauts who take long trips to space return with brains that have floated to the top of their skulls |url=https://qz.com/1119668/space-travel-changes-astronauts-brains/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body. It can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system. Zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=YOUNG|first=LAURENCE R.|date=1999-05-01|title=Artificial Gravity Considerations for a Mars Exploration Mission|url=https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09198.x|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=871|issue=1 OTOLITH FUNCT|pages=367–378|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09198.x|issn=1749-6632|bibcode=1999NYASA.871..367Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, [[NASA]]-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into [[outer space]], including travel to the [[Mars|planet Mars]], may substantially damage the  [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tissues]] of astronauts. The studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the [[brain]]s of astronauts, and age them prematurely.&lt;ref name="TI-20181002"&gt;{{cite news |last=Griffin |first=Andrew |title=Travelling to Mars and deep into space could kill astronauts by destroying their guts, finds Nasa-funded study - Previous work has shown that astronauts could age prematurely and have damaged brain tissue after long journeys |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/nasa-mars-deep-space-journey-guts-gi-digestive-animal-study-gastrointestinal-health-a8563926.html |date=2 October 2018 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) of five ''[[Enterobacter|Enterobacter bugandensis]]'' bacterial strains, none [[Pathogen|pathogenic]] to humans, that [[microorganism]]s on ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts.&lt;ref name="EA-20181122"&gt;{{cite web |author=BioMed Central |title=ISS microbes should be monitored to avoid threat to astronaut health |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/bc-ims112018.php |date=22 November 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=25 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMC-20181123"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh, Nitin K. et al. |title=Multi-drug resistant Enterobacter bugandensis species isolated from the International Space Station and comparative genomic analyses with human pathogenic strains |url=https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2 |date=23 November 2018 |journal=[[BMC Microbiology]] |volume=18 |page=175 |doi=10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2 |accessdate=25 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and drink==

{{main|Space food}}

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about 0.83 kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day. (The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds)  Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment.  Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.
On Earth, the average American uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day.  On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.

==Deaths==
{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian ([[Soviet Union]]), and one was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian [[spaceflight participant]].

'''Body memory''' (BM) is a [[hypothesis]] that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory{{R|"cosier"}} there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories.{{R|"Smith"}}{{R|"Lilienfeld"}}

Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for [[PTSD]].{{R|"M.D.2014"}}

== Overview ==

Peter Levine calls BM ''[[implicit memory]]'' or more specifically [[procedural memory]], things that the body is capable of doing automatically and not in one's consciousness. He clarifies 3 types of BM and frames his work in terms of [[traumatic memory]] consequence and resolution:{{R|"levine"}}
#Learned motor actions - Action patterns that can be continuously modified over time by higher brain regions.
#Emergency response - Hardwired instinctual behaviors (i.e., fight or flight response, etc...).
#Attraction or repulsion - We are attracted to sources of nourishment and growth and repulsed from sources of injury or toxicity.

Nicola Diamond elaborates on the opinion of philosopher [[Merleau Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]] and asserts that BM is formed by doing. Whether practicing a bodily activity or forming a reaction to a traumatic memory.{{R|"Diamond2013"}}

Edward Casey speaks of BM as, "memory intrinsic to the body, how we remember by and through the body", rather than what is remembered about the body.{{R|"Casey2009"}}

Thomas Fuchs defines 6 different types of BM: procedural, situational, intercorporeal, incorporative, pain, and traumatic memory. He notes that they are not strictly separable from one another but "derived from different dimensions of bodily experience.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|12}} Michelle Summa further refines this definition as an implicit memory. A pre-thematic, operative consciousness of the past expressed through the body.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|30}}

[[Antonio Damasio]] calls these reactions to memories ''somatic markers'' or emotions that are expressed primarily as physical feelings.{{R|"Ansermet2018"}}

These memories are often associated with [[phantom pain]] in a part or parts of the body – the body appearing to remember the past trauma.  The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of [[repressed memories]], in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations.{{R|"Smith"}} It may also be associated with phantom limb sensation but this is less common.{{R|"price"}}

=== Skepticism ===

In 1993, Susan E. Smith, presented a paper relating the idea of "Survivor Psychology" at a [[false memory syndrome]] [[Academic conference|conference]], stated about BM that, "body memories are thought to literally be emotional, kinesthetic, or chemical recordings stored at the cellular level and retrievable by returning to or recreating the chemical, emotional, or kinesthetic conditions under which the memory recordings are filed.{{R|"Smith"}} She went on in the abstract of the paper, "one of the most commonly used theories to support the ideology of [[repressed memories]] or incest and sexual abuse amnesia is body memories." and "The belief in these pseudoscientific concepts appears to be related to [[Scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]], gullibility, and a lack of critical thinking skills and reasoning abilities in both the mental health community and in society at large"{{R|"Smith"}}

A 2017 systematic review of cross-disciplinary research in body memory found that the available data neither largely support or refute the claim that memories are stored outside of the brain and more research is needed.{{R|"riva"}}

In the ''Encyclopedia of Phenomenology'' Embree notes that, "To posit body memory is to open up a [[Pandora's Box]]", and links the idea to physical associations of memory rather than as a memory stored in a bodily manner.{{R|"Embree2013"}}

== Cellular memory ==

Cellular memory (CM) is a parallel hypothesis to BM positing that memories can be stored outside the brain in all cells.{{R|"skepdic"}} The idea that non-brain tissues can have memories is believed by some who have received [[organ transplantation|organ transplants]], though this is considered impossible. The author said the stories are intriguing though and may lead to some serious scientific investigation in the future.{{R|"skepdic"}} In his book ''TransplantNation'' Douglas Vincent suggests that atypical newfound memories, thoughts, emotions and preferences after an organ transplant are more suggestive of [[immunosuppressant drugs]] and the stress of surgery on perception than of legitimate memory transference. In other words, "as imaginary as a bad trip on [[LSD]] or other [[psychotropic drug]]."{{R|"vincent"}}

=== Flatworms ===

Biologists at [[Tufts University]] have been able to train [[flatworms]] despite the loss of the brain and head. This may show memory stored in other parts of the body in some animals.{{R|"planaria"}} A worm reduced to 1/279th of the original can be regrown within a few weeks and be trained much quicker to head towards light and open space for food, an unnatural behavior for a flatworm. With each head removed training times appear reduced. This may just be a sign of [[epigenetics]] showing the appearance of memory.{{R|"anthony"}}

However, in the 1950s and 1960s [[James V. McConnell|James McConnell]] flatworm experiments measured how long it took to learn a maze. McConnell trained some to move around a maze and then chopped them up and fed them to untrained worms. The untrained group learned faster compared to a control that had not been fed trained worms. McConnell believed the experiment indicated cellular memory.{{R|"Hood"}} The training involved stressing the worms with electric shock. This kind of stress releases persistent [[hormones]] and shows no evidence for memory transfer. Similar experiments with mice being trained and being fed to untrained mice showed improved learning. It was not a memory that was transferred but hormone enriched tissue.{{R|"Hood"}}

=== Current usage and research ===
{{See Also|Epigenetics|Immune memory}}

In epigenetics there are various mechanisms for cells to pass on "memories" of stressors to their progeny. Strategies include Msn2 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, changes in chromatin, partitioning of anti-stress factors, and damaged [[macromolecules]] between mother and daughter cells.{{R|"pmid29846762"}}

In [[adaptive immunity]] there is a functional CM that enables he immune system to learn to react to pathogens through mechanisms such as, cytoxic memory mediation in [[bone marrow]],{{R|"pmid15978522"}}, innate immune memory in [[stromal cells]],{{R|"pmid29729109"}}, [[fungal]] mediation of innate and inherited [[immunological]] response,{{R|"pmid29842944"}} and T and B-cell immune training.{{R|"rosenblum"}} In this regard CM is essential for [[vaccine]] and [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Computational representational understanding of mind''' ('''CRUM''') is a [[hypothesis]] in [[cognitive science]] which proposes that thinking is performed by [[computations]] operating on representations. This hypothesis assumes that the mind has [[Mental representation|mental representations]] analogous to [[data structures]] and computational procedures analogous to [[algorithms]], such that computer programs using algorithms applied to data structures can model the mind and its processes.

CRUM takes into consideration several theoretical approaches of understanding human [[cognition]], including [[logic]], [[:wikt:rule|rule]], [[concept]], [[analogy]], image, and connection based systems. These serve as the representation aspects of CRUM theory which are then acted upon to simulate certain aspects of human cognition, such as the use of [[rule-based systems]] in [[neuroeconomics]]. 

There is much disagreement on this hypothesis, but CRUM has high regard among some researchers {{citation needed|reason=Need link to sources|date=April 2016}}. Philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] called it "the most theoretically and experimentally successful approach to mind ever developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science|last=Thagard|first=Paul|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=9780262701099|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

'''Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature''', which opened in 1854, was set up by the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] as a new enterprise to occupy part of its buildings when it  re-erected the Crystal Palace in suburban [[Sydenham]] in 1853. Civil engineer and later first director of the [[Royal College of Music]], [[George Grove]] was appointed secretary. It was a part of the great movements for educational and social reform of the nineteenth century.

The main buildings were destroyed by fire in 1936.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Letter to The Editor, ''The Times'', Monday Dec. 07, 1936. page 10, issue 47551&lt;br&gt;
The end of the Crystal Palace brings to mind  memories of the School of Engineering which was housed  in the South Tower, fortunately still standing firm as a rock. This school, founded by J. W. Wilson, M.I.M.E., an engineer who helped to build the Great Exhibition of 1851, sent many of its students to the four quarters of the globe. The curriculum of the school included mechanical and civil courses and about five of the circular rooms were used. There was a fitting shop, pattern shop, and drawing office. Those in the mechanical section built a 4 h.p. vertical engine which was generally exhibited at the head of the stairs on the south side of the Palace. In the Civil Engineering section we surveyed the whole of the grounds, and drew plans and made estimates for an imaginary railway which extended from one side to the other. This entailed all the necessary estimates for embankments, a cantilever bridge etc. Then there was the Colonial section presided over by a most congenial superintendent, who had no doubt seen much of a pioneer's life and infused his enthusiasm into those who belonged to his section. Concerning the rigidity of the South Tower, I was working in a high storey soon after joining the school when there was a strong wind, and, feeling giddy, I mentioned it to the superintendent. He informed me that it rocked several inches at the top, which made it safer than absolute rigidity.–Mr F. C. Bell, 74, Berners Street, Ipswich.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe''''' is a science book by [[mathematical physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] published by [[The Bodley Head]] in 2010. The book outlines Penrose's [[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology]] (CCC) model, which is an extension of [[general relativity]] but opposed to the widely supported multidimensional [[String theory|string theories]] and [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] following the [[Big Bang]].

==Synopsis==
Penrose examines implications of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second Law]] of Thermodynamics and its inevitable march toward a maximum [[entropy]] state of the [[universe]]. Penrose illustrates entropy in terms of information state [[phase space]] (with 1 dimension for every [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]) where particles end up moving through ever larger grains of this phase space from smaller grains over time due to random motion. He disagrees with [[Stephen Hawking]]'s back-track&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawking|first=S.W.|title=Information Loss in Black Holes|journal=Physical Review D|date=18 July 2005|volume=72|issue=8 |pages=084013|arxiv=hep-th/0507171 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.72.084013 |bibcode = 2005PhRvD..72h4013H }}&lt;/ref&gt; over whether [[Black hole information paradox|information is destroyed]] when matter enters [[black holes]]. Such information loss would non-trivially lower total entropy in the universe as the black holes wither away due to [[Hawking radiation]], resulting in a loss in phase space degrees of freedom.

Penrose goes on further to state that over enormous scales of time (beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years), distance ceases to be meaningful as all [[mass]] breaks down into extremely [[red shift|red-shifted]] [[photon]] energy, whereupon time has no influence, and the universe continues to expand without event {{math|[[Arrow (symbol)|→]]}}{{math|[[Infinity|∞]]}}. This period from Big Bang to infinite expansion Penrose defines as an [[aeon]]. The smooth [[no-hair theorem|“hairless”]] [[Infinity|infinite]] oblivion of the previous aeon becomes the low-entropy Big Bang state of the next aeon cycle. [[Conformal geometry]] preserves the angles but not the distances of the previous aeon, allowing the new aeon universe to appear quite small at its inception as its phase space starts anew.

Penrose cites concentric rings found in the [[WMAP]] [[cosmic microwave background]] survey as preliminary evidence for his model, as he predicted black hole collisions from the previous aeon would leave such structures due to ripples of [[gravitational waves]].

==Reception==
Most nonexpert critics (nonscientists) have found the book a challenge to fully comprehend; a few such as ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe – Review|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doug Johnstone for ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnstone|first=Doug|title=Book reviews: The Grand Design {{!}} Cycles of Time|url=http://living.scotsman.com/books/Book-reviews-The-Grand-Design.6538072.jp|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; appreciate the against the grain innovative ideas Penrose puts forth. [[Quantum (book)|Manjit Kumar]] reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' admires the [[Russian doll]] geometry play of the CCC concept, framing it as an idea of which [[M. C. Escher]] "would have approved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Manjit|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe by Roger Penrose – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|accessdate=27 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Storrs for the ''New York Journal of Books'' concedes that this is not the book that an unambitious lay person should plunge into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storrs|first=Graham|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe|journal=New York Journal of Books|date=3 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/cycles-time-extraordinary-new-view-universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American fiction writer [[Anthony Doerr]] in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' writes "Penrose has never shied away from including mathematics in his texts, and kudos to his publisher for honoring that wish. That said, the second half of ''Cycles of Time'' offers some seriously hard sledding"; "If you'll forgive a skiing metaphor, ''Cycles of Time'' is a black diamond of a book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doerr|first=Anthony|title=The music of physics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28691694.html|accessdate=15 April 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2011|agency=(subscription required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9606">'''Daffy's Elixir''' (also sometimes known as '''Daffey's Elixir''' or '''Daffye's Elixir''') is a name that has been used by several [[patent medicines]] over the years. It was originally designed for diseases of the stomach, but was later marketed as a universal cure. It remained a popular remedy in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and later the [[United States of America]] throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

== Origins ==

Daffy's Elixir was one of the most popular and frequently advertised [[patent medicines]] in Britain during the 18th century. It is reputed to have been invented by clergyman [[Thomas Daffy]] rector of [[Redmile]], [[Leicestershire]], in 1647. He named it '''elixir salutis''' (lit. ''elixir of health'') and promoted as a generic [[cure-all]].

== Ingredients ==

An early recipe for "True Daffy" from 1700 lists the following ingredients: [[aniseed]], [[brandy]], [[cochineal]], [[elecampane]], [[fennel seed]], [[jalap]], [[manna]], [[parsley seed]], [[raisin]], [[rhubarb]], [[saffron]], [[Senna (plant)|senna]] and [[spanish liquorice]]. Chemical analysis has shown this to be a [[laxative]] made mostly from alcohol. Other recipes include [[Guaiacum|Guiuacum]] wood chips, [[caraway]], [[Potassium carbonate|Salt of Tartar]], and [[scammony]].

== Uses ==

According to an early nineteenth century advertisement it was used for the following ailments: The Stone in Babies and Children; [[Convulsion]] [[Seizure|fits]]; [[Tuberculosis|Consumption]] and Bad [[Digestion|Digestives]]; [[Fever|Agues]]; [[Hemorrhoid|Piles]]; Surfeits; Fits of the Mother and [[Vapours (disease)|Vapours]] from the [[Spleen]]; [[Chlorosis (medicine)|Green Sickness]]; Children's Distempers, whether the [[Cestoda|Worms]], [[Rickets]], [[Urolithiasis|Stones]], Convulsions, [[Baby colic|Gripes]], [[Scrofula|King's Evil]], Joint Evil or any other disorder proceeding from [[Flatulence|Wind]] or Crudities; [[Gout]] and [[Rheumatism]]; [[Kidney stone|Stone or Gravel]] in the Kidnies; [[Colic|Cholic and Griping of the Bowels]]; the [[Tuberculosis|Phthisic]] (both as cure and preventative provided always that the patient be moderate in drinking, have a care to prevent taking cold and keep a good diet; [[Edema|Dropsy]] and [[Scurvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fleming | first = Lindsay | title = Daffy's Elixir | journal = Notes and Queries  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 238–9 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | date = June 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of the medicine to treat Colic, gripes or fret in [[horse]]s was deplored in early [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = White | first = James |title = Treatise on veterinary medicine | publisher = Longman | year = 1820 | location = London | page = 121 | volume=2 | url = | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent history ==

After Daffy's death in 1680 the recipe was left to his daughter Catherine, and his kinsmen Anthony and Daniel who were [[apothecary|apothecaries]] in [[Nottingham]]. Anthony Daffy moved to London in the 1690s and began to exploit the product issuing pamphlets such as ''Directions for taking elixir salutis or, the famous purging cordial, known by the name of Daffy's elixir salutis'' [London], [1690?]. His widow Elleanor Daffy continued from about 1693 and (their daughter?) Katharine from about 1707. During the early 18th century the product was advertised widely in the emerging national and local [[newspaper]]s. The success attracted several counterfeit copies, using inferior alcohol rather than brandy.

The medicine was later produced by William and Cluer Dicey &amp; Co. of Bow Church yard c.1775 who claimed the sole rights of manufacture of the True Daffy's Elixir, although the recipe was not subject to any patent. Proprietorship was also then claimed by Peter Swinton of Salisbury Court and his son Anthony Daffy Swinton who may have been descended from the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, (1953), p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey and Co. and their successors marketed it in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Coxe | first = John Redman | title = The American dispensatory | publisher = Carey and Lea | year = 1831 | location = Philadelphia  | page = 780  | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then passed to Dicey and Sutton, and later to Messrs W. Sutton &amp; Co. of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] [[Middlesex]] who continuing to market it throughout the nineteenth century. The use of Daffy's elixir is referred to in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel [[Barchester Towers]], 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Trollope | first = Anthony | title = Barchester Towers | publisher = Folio Society | year = 1977 | location = London | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned on several occasions in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel [[Mason &amp; Dixon]], particularly by [[Jeremiah Dixon]], who attempts to procure large quantities before beginning his surveying trip with [[Charles Mason]].  Dixon is warned by [[Benjamin Franklin]], however, that imported Daffy's Elixir is extremely expensive, and he would be better off ordering a customized version from the [[apothecary]].  During the same visit, Dixon also orders [[laudanum]], a well-known constipating agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pynchon | first = Thomas | title = Mason &amp; Dixon | publisher = Penguin | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned in the [[Charles Dickens]] book, [[Oliver Twist]], Ch. II, where it is referred to as Daffy, in the sentence: 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,(the Parish [[Beadle]])' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. 'It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.'

Daffy’s Elixir is also mentioned in the [[Works of William Makepeace Thackeray]] book, [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]], Chapter XXXVIII A Family In a Small Way, where it is referenced in the sentence ‘..and there found Mrs. Sedley  in the act of surreptitiously administering Daffy’s Elixir to the infant.’

== Early advertisements ==

''Daffy’s original elixir salutis, vindicated against all counterfeits, &amp;c. or, An advertisement by mee, Anthony Daffy, of London, citizen and student in physick, By way of vindication of my famous and generally approved cordial drink, (called elixir salutis) from the notoriously false suggestions of one Tho.

'''Ear candling''', also called '''ear coning''' or '''thermal-auricular therapy''', is an [[alternative medicine]] practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow [[candle]] and placing the other end in the [[ear canal]]. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective&lt;ref name="Seely"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Seely, D.R. |author2=Quigley, S.M. |author3=Langman, A.W. | title=Ear candles: Efficacy and safety |journal=Laryngoscope |year=1996 |pages=1226–9 |volume=106 |issue=10 |pmid=8849790 |doi=10.1097/00005537-199610000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not help remove [[earwax]] or [[toxicant]]s.&lt;ref name=MayoClinic.org&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beatty M.D.|first1=Charles W|title=Ear Candling: Is it Safe?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/consumer-health/expert-answers/ear-candling/faq-20058212|website=MayoClinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=7 June 2014|ref=MayoClinic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and effectiveness==
[[Edzard Ernst]] has published critically on the subject of ear candles, noting, "There is no data to suggest that it is effective for any condition. Furthermore, ear candles have been associated with ear injuries. The inescapable conclusion is that ear candles do more harm than good. Their use should be discouraged."&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;{{cite journal| author=Edzard Ernst|authorlink=Edzard Ernst | title=Ear candles: a triumph of ignorance over science| journal= The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology | year=2004 |volume=118 | issue=1 |pages=1–2| pmid=14979962| doi=10.1258/002221504322731529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TrickOrTreatment&gt;{{cite book |author1=Singh, Simon.  |author2=Ernzt, E. | title=[[Trick or Treatment]]: Alternative medicine on trial | year=2008 | publisher=Bantam Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (US FDA), ear candling is sometimes promoted with claims that the practice can "purify the blood" or "cure" cancer, but that [[Health Canada]] has determined the candles have no effect on the ear, and no health benefit; instead they create risk of injury, especially when used on children.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/fda/stay-away-ear-candles |publisher=[[WebMD]] |editor=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |title=Don't Get Burned: Stay Away From Ear Candles |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, US FDA issued an alert identifying ear candles (also known as ear cones or auricular candles) as "dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration, prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof" ... "since the use of a lit candle in the proximity of a person's face would carry a high risk of causing potentially severe skin/hair burns and middle ear damage."&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia7701.html|title=Detention Without Physical Examination of Ear Candles|accessdate=2007-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114035555/http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia7701.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 paper in the journal ''[[Canadian Family Physician]]'' concludes:

{{quote|Ear candling appears to be popular and is heavily advertised with claims that could seem scientific to lay people. However, its claimed mechanism of action has not been verified, no positive clinical effect has been reliably recorded, and it is associated with considerable risk. No evidence suggests that ear candling is an effective treatment for any condition. On this basis, we believe it can do more harm than good and we recommend that GPs discourage its use.&lt;ref name=Rafferty&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Rafferty |author2=MB CHB |author3=A.

A 2007 paper in ''[[American Family Physician]]'' said:

{{quote|Ear candling also should be avoided. Ear candling is a practice in which a hollow candle is inserted into the external auditory canal and lit, with the patient lying on the opposite ear. In theory, the combination of heat and suction is supposed to remove earwax. However, in one trial, ear candles neither created suction nor removed wax and actually led to occlusion with candle wax in persons who previously had clean ear canals. Primary care physicians may see complications from ear candling including candle wax occlusion, local burns, and tympanic membrane perforation.&lt;ref name=McCarter&gt;McCarter, ''et al''.

{{clear}}[[Image:Typical ear candling contents.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Material that appears after ear candling, sometimes alleged to be earwax and toxins, was found to be residue from the candle itself.]]

The [[Spokane]] Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic conducted a research study in 1996 which concluded that ear candling does not produce negative pressure and was ineffective in removing wax from the ear canal.&lt;ref name="Seely"/&gt; Several studies have shown that ear candles produce the same residue when burnt without ear insertion and that the residue is simply candle wax and soot.&lt;ref name="Seely" /&gt;&lt;ref name="straight dope"&gt;{{cite web|year=1995|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_098.html|title=The Straight Dope: How do "ear candles" work?|accessdate=2006-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/pre-2007/files/health/earcandle/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601193035/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/pre-2007/files/health/earcandle/index.html|archivedate=2013-06-01|title=Listen up: Beware of the &lt;nowiki&gt;'ear candle'&lt;/nowiki&gt;|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=CBC Marketplace|date=2002-02-22|accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2008}}, there are at least two cases in which people have set their houses on fire while ear candling, one of which resulted in death.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't put a candle in your ear and save $25 |author=Joe Schwartz |date=30 August 2008 |publisher=Montreal Gazette |page=I11 |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=a124f47e-ba20-482e-8acf-3e772e868e4f |location=Montreal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628222621/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=a124f47e-ba20-482e-8acf-3e772e868e4f |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of ENT surgeons found some who had treated people with complications from ear candling. Burns were the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ear candles—Efficacy and safety: Seely DR, Quigley SM, Langman AW.

{{clear}}

==Procedure==
[[File:Ear candling-self applied.jpg|thumb|Attempting the procedure.]]
One end of a cylinder or cone of waxed cloth is lit, and the other is placed into the subject's ear. The flame is cut back occasionally with scissors and extinguished between five and ten centimeters (two to four inches) from the subject.

The subject is lying on one side with the treated ear uppermost and the candle vertical. The candle can be stuck through a paper plate or aluminium pie tin to protect against any hot wax or ash falling onto the subject. Another way to perform ear candling involves the subject lying face up with the ear candle extending out to the side with a forty-five-degree upward slant.  A dish of water is placed next to the subject under the ear candle.

Proponents claim that the flame creates negative pressure, drawing wax and debris out of the ear canal,&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite web | url = http://healing.about.com/cs/holistictherapies/a/earcandling.htm | title = Ear Candling:Why Would You Want to Candle Your Ears? | author=Phylameana lila Desy | publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appears as a dark residue.

An ear candling session lasts up to one hour, during which one or two ear candles may be burned for each ear.

== Product regulations ==
In Europe, some ear candles bear the [[CE mark]] (93/42/EEC), though they are mostly self-issued by the manufacturer. This mark indicates that the device is designed and manufactured so as not to compromise the safety of patients, but no independent testing is required as proof.&lt;ref name="Goldacre"&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldacre| first = Ben| |authorlink=Ben Goldacre| title = Waxing sceptical| publisher = [[The Guardian]]| date = 2004-03-04| url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1161248,00.html| accessdate = 2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ear candles are widely available in the U.S., selling or importing them with medical claims is illegal. This means that one cannot market ear candles as products that "Diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any disease".&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;

In a report, [[Health Canada]] states "There is no scientific proof to support claims that ear candling provides medical benefits. ... However, there is plenty of proof that ear candling is dangerous." It says that while some people claim to be selling the candles "for entertainment purposes only", the Canadian government maintains that there is no reasonable non-medical use, and hence any sale of the devices is illegal in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="HealthCanada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/alt_formats/pacrb-dgapcr/pdf/iyh-vsv/med/ear-oreille-eng.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-15|title=It's your health: Ear Candling|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromstein"/&gt;

In a paper published by Edzard Ernst in ''Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology'', the cost of practicing ear candling according to the recommended frequency of use is estimated. As each candles costs $3.15 USD (adjusted for inflation), the annual cost of the treatment would amount to $982.00 USD (also adjusted for inflation). The author calls the continued practice of the treatment "a triumph of ignorance over science ... or perhaps a triumph of commercial interests over medical reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ear candles: a triumph of ignorance over science|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0022215104000015|journal = The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 1748-5460|pages = 1–2|volume = 118|issue = 01|doi = 10.1258/002221504322731529|first = Edzard|last = Ernst|authorlink=Edzard Ernst |pmid=14979962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Although Biosun, a manufacturer of ear candles, refers to them as "Hopi" ear candles, there is no such treatment within traditional [[Hopi]] healing practices.  Vanessa Charles, public relations officer for the Hopi Tribal Council, has stated that ear candling "is not and has never been a practice conducted by the Hopi tribe or the Hopi people."&lt;ref name=Bromstein&gt;{{cite news|last=Bromstein |first=Elizabeth |title=Wax on, wax off: Does candling clear canal or burn it? |publisher=NOW Magazine |date=13 January 2005 |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/lifestyle/story.cfm?content=145396&amp;archive=24,20,2005 |accessdate=25 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005070247/http://www.nowtoronto.com/lifestyle/story.cfm?content=145396&amp;archive=24%2C20%2C2005 |archivedate=5 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hopi tribe has repeatedly asked Biosun, the manufacturer of 'Hopi Ear Candles', to stop using the Hopi name.&lt;ref name=Hopi&gt;{{cite web | title=Authenticity of the Hopi Candle | url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ahcare.qua/programme/earcandling.html#authenticity | date=2004-03-02 | publisher=Active Health|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071341/http://freespace.virgin.net/ahcare.qua/index5.html|archivedate=August 23, 2006}} "The Hopi Cultural Preservation Office is not aware of Hopi people ever practicing 'Ear Candling.'  Biosun and Revital Ltd. are misrepresenting the name 'Hopi' with their products.  This therapy should not be called 'Hopi Ear Candeling.' [sic]  The history of Ear Candeling [sic] should not refer to being used by the Hopi Tribe.  Use of this false information with reference to Hopi should be stopped."&lt;/ref&gt; Biosun has not complied with this request and continues to claim that ear candles originated within the Hopi tribe.&lt;ref name=biosun_claim&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopi Ear Candles |url=http://en.biosun.com/ohrkerze/ |publisher=Biosun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413061322/http://en.biosun.com/ohrkerze/ |archivedate=2011-04-13 |df= }} "The Hopi, the oldest Pueblo people with great medicinal knowledge and a high degree of spirituality, brought this knowledge to Europe with the professional involvement of BIOSUN."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advocates of ear candles claim that the treatment originates from traditional Chinese, Egyptian, or North American medicine. The mythical city of [[Atlantis]] is also reported to be the origin of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Roazen (M.D.)|first=Lisa|title=Why Ear Candling Is Not a Good Idea|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candling.html|website = www.quackwatch.com|date=2010-05-12|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional Freedom Techniques''' ('''EFT''') is a form of [[Intervention (counseling)|counseling intervention]] that draws on various theories of [[alternative medicine]] including [[acupuncture]], [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[energy medicine]], and [[Thought Field Therapy]] (TFT).  It is best known through '''Gary Craig'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''EFT Handbook'', published in the late 1990s, and related books and workshops by a variety of teachers.  EFT and similar techniques are often discussed under the umbrella term "[[energy psychology]]".

Advocates claim that the technique may be used to treat a wide variety of physical and psychological disorders, and as a simple form of self-administered therapy.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{Cite book | title = EFT Manual | last = Craig | format = pdf | first = G | url = http://www.spiritual-web.com/downloads/eftmanual.pdf | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' describes the foundations of EFT as "a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the ancient Chinese philosophy of [[Qi|chi]], which is thought to be the 'life force' that flows throughout the body." The existence of this life force is "not empirically supported".&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;

EFT has no benefit as a therapy beyond the [[placebo effect]] or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be provided in addition to the purported "energy" technique.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt; It is generally characterized as [[pseudoscience]] and it has not garnered significant support in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Delphi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Eft punkte.jpg|thumb|''EFT-tapping points''&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;]]
During a typical EFT session, the person will focus on a specific issue while tapping on "[[acupuncture point|end points of the body's energy meridians]]".

According to the EFT manual, the procedure consists of the participant rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a [[Subjective Units of Distress Scale]] (SUDS) (a [[Likert scale]] for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0-10) then repeating an orienting [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]] while rubbing or tapping specific points on the body. Some practitioners incorporate eye movements or other tasks. The emotional intensity is then rescored and repeated until no changes are noted in the emotional intensity.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==Mechanism==

Proponents of EFT and other similar treatments believe that tapping/stimulating acupuncture points provide the basis for significant improvement in psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Feinstein/&gt; However, the theory and mechanisms underlying the supposed effectiveness of EFT have "no evidentiary support" "in the entire history of the sciences of biology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, physics, or psychology." Researchers have described the theoretical model for EFT as "frankly bizarre" and "pseudoscientific."&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;  One review noted that one of the highest quality studies found no evidence that the location of tapping points made any difference, and attributed effects to well-known psychological mechanisms, including distraction and breathing therapy.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;&lt;ref name="srmhp"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.srmhp.org/0201/emotional-freedom-technique.html | title=Assessment of the Emotional Freedom Technique |author1=Waite, Wendy L |author2=Holder, Mark D | journal=Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice | year=2003 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' argued that there is no plausible mechanism to explain how the specifics of EFT could add to its effectiveness, and they have been described as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal | accessdate = 2011-12-12 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/can_we_really_tap_our_problems_away_a_critical_analysis_of_thought_field_th/ | title=Can we really tap our problems away? |vauthors=Gaudiano BA, Herbert JD | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | year=2000 | volume=24 | issue=4 | format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has not been found for the existence of [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].&lt;ref name = Ernst&gt;{{cite book | last = Singh | first = S | authorlink = Simon Singh |author2=Ernst E |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst  | year = 2008 | title = [[Trick or Treatment|Trick or treatment: The undeniable facts about alternative medicine]] | isbn = 978-0-393-06661-6 | publisher = [[W.

== Research quality ==

EFT has no useful effect as a therapy beyond the placebo effect or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be used with the purported "energy" technique, but proponents of EFT have published material claiming otherwise. Their work, however, is flawed and hence unreliable: high-quality research has never confirmed that EFT is effective.&lt;ref name=Bakker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Gary M.|title=The current status of energy psychology: Extraordinary claims with less than ordinary evidence|journal=Clinical Psychologist|date=November 2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=91–99|doi=10.1111/cp.12020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review found "methodological flaws" in research studies that had reported "small successes" for EFT and the related [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]. The review concluded that positive results may be "attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation. Psychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 systematic review found that EFT was effective in reducing [[anxiety]] compared to controls, but also called for more research comparing its effectiveness to that of established treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clond |first=Morgan |date=May 2016 |title=Emotional Freedom Techniques for Anxiety: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=204 |issue=5 |pages=388–395 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000483 |issn=1539-736X |pmid=26894319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

A [[Delphi method|Delphi]] poll of an expert panel of psychologists rated EFT on a scale describing how discredited EFT has been in the field of psychology.  On average, this panel found EFT had a score of 3.8 on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0, with 3.0 meaning "possibly discredited" and a 4.0 meaning "probably discredited."&lt;ref name=Delphi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norcross|first=John C.|author2=Koocher, Gerald P. |author3=Garofalo, Ariele |title=Discredited psychological treatments and tests: A Delphi poll.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=1 January 2006|volume=37|issue=5|pages=515–522|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.37.5.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book examining pseudoscientific practices in psychology characterized EFT as one of a number of "fringe psychotherapeutic practices",&lt;ref name=Guilford&gt;{{cite book|first=Scott O. |last=Lilienfeld|title=Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology|year=2003|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-828-1|pages=2|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a psychiatry handbook states EFT has "all the hallmarks of [[pseudoscience]]".&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Semple|title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-969388-7|pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFT, along with its predecessor, Thought Field Therapy, has been dismissed with warnings to avoid their use by publications such as ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)|url=http://www.skepdic.com/eft.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Mental Help: Procedures to Avoid|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mentserv.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of EFT and other energy psychology therapies have been "particularly interested" in seeking "scientific credibility" despite the implausible proposed mechanisms for EFT.&lt;ref name = Bakker/&gt;  A 2008 review by energy psychology proponent David Feinstein concluded that energy psychology was a potential "rapid and potent treatment for a range of psychological conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=D|title=Energy psychology: A review of the preliminary evidence.|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2008|volume=45|issue=2|pages=199–213|pmid=22122417|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.45.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this work by Feinstein has been widely criticized. One review criticized Feinstein's methodology, noting he ignored several research papers that did not show positive effects of EFT, and that Feinstein did not disclose his [[conflict of interest]] as an owner of a website that sells energy psychology products such as books and seminars, contrary to the best practices of research publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pignotti|first=M|author2=Thyer, B|title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence?|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2009|volume=46|issue=2|pages=257–61|pmid=22122623|doi=10.1037/a0016027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review criticized Feinstein's conclusion, which was based on research of weak quality and instead concluded that any positive effects of EFT are due to the more traditional psychological techniques rather than any putative "energy" manipulation.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;  A book published on the subject of [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] treatment of substance abuse called Feinstein's review "incomplete and misleading" and an example of a poorly performed evidence-based review of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editors|first=Katherine van Wormer, Bruce A. Thyer,|title=Evidence-based practice in the field of substance abuse : a book of readings|date=2010|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=1412975778|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein published another review in 2012, concluding that energy psychology techniques "consistently demonstrated strong effect sizes and other positive statistical results that far exceed chance after relatively few treatment sessions".&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/16/4/364/ | title=Acupoint stimulation in treating psychological disorders: Evidence of efficacy | author=Feinstein, David | journal=Review of General Psychology |date=December 2012  | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=364–380 | doi=10.1037/a0028602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review was also criticized, where again it was noted that Feinstein dismissed higher quality studies which showed no effects of EFT, in favor of methodologically weaker studies which did show a positive effect.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;

{{Energy therapy}}

The term "'''energy'''" is used by writers and practitioners of various [[esoteric]] forms of [[spirituality]] and [[alternative medicine]] to refer to a variety of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Stenger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stenger|first=Victor J|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508003317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |deadurl=yes|archivedate=2016-05-08|title=Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|volume=3|number=1|date=Spring–Summer 1999 |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jonathan C.|title=Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=9781405181228|pages=268–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no [[scientific evidence]] for the existence of such energy.&lt;ref name="Stenger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/energy.html |title=energy – (according to New Age thinking) |publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapies that purport to use, modify, or manipulate unknown energies are thus among the most contentious of all complementary and [[alternative medicine]]s. Claims related to energy therapies are most often [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] (from single stories), rather than being based on repeatable [[empirical]] evidence.&lt;ref name="energy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/reich.html |title=Some Notes on Wilhelm Reich, M.D |publisher=Quackwatch.org |date=2002-02-15 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarvis|first1=William T.|url=https://www.ncahf.org/articles/o-r/reiki.html|title=Reiki|publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud|date=2000-12-01|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Concepts such as "life force" and "[[élan vital]]" existed from antiquity and emerged from the debate over [[vitalism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries with Mesmer and the magnetism. They continued to be discussed in the 20th century by some thinkers and practitioners in the modern [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref name="Stenger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

As biologists studied [[embryology]] and [[developmental biology]], particularly before the discovery of genes, a variety of organisational forces were posited to account for their observations. German biologist [[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941), proposed [[Hans Driesch#The philosophy of entelechy|entelechy]], an energy which he believed controlled organic processes.&lt;ref name="Vitalism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bechtel|first1=William|last2=Richardson|first2=Robert C.|title=Vitalism|url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/~bill/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm|website=William Bechtel's Web|publisher=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2014-05-02|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=November 2017}} However such ideas are discredited and modern [[science]] has all but abandoned the attempt to associate additional energetic properties with [[life]].&lt;ref name="Vitalism"/&gt;

According to [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]], the [[energy|scientific term energy]] is, in fact, misused in the context of spirituality and alternative medicine:

{{quote|That's all that energy is: a measurement of work capability. But in popular culture, 'energy' has somehow become a noun. "Energy" is often spoken of as if it is a thing unto itself, like a region of glowing power, that can be contained and used. Here's a good test. When you hear the word "energy" used, substitute the phrase "measurable work capability." Does the usage still make sense? Remember, energy itself is not the thing being measured: energy is the measurement of work performed or of potential... Thus, this New Age concept of the body having an "energy field" is fatally doomed. There is no such thing as an energy field; they are two unrelated concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4411|number=411|title=Your Body's Alleged Energy Fields|date=22 April 2014|last=Dunning|first=Brian|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the lack of scientific support, spiritual writers and thinkers have maintained ideas about energy and continue to promote them either as useful allegories or as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Crawford|first2=CC|title=Science and spiritual healing: a critical review of spiritual healing, "energy" medicine, and intentionality.|journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=March 2003|volume=9|issue=2|pages=56–61|pmid=12652884}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[energy medicine]] purports to manipulate energy, but there is no credible evidence to support this.&lt;ref name="energy"/&gt;

The concept of "[[qi]]" (energy) appears throughout traditional [[East Asia]]n [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture]], such as in the art of [[feng shui]] and [[Chinese martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latham|first1=Kevin|title=Pop Culture China!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781851095827|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qi philosophy also includes the notion of "negative qi", typically understood as introducing [[negative mood]]s like outright [[fear]] or more moderate expressions like [[social anxiety]] or [[awkwardness]].&lt;ref name="Norden2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan W.|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtK5750bm30C&amp;pg=PA98|date=March 2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=1603846158|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deflecting this negative qi through [[geomancy]] is a preoccupation in [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=George J.|authorlink=George Leonard|title=The Asian Pacific American Heritage: A Companion to Literature and Arts|date=1999|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9780203344590|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional explanation of [[acupuncture]] states that it works by manipulating the circulation of qi through a network of [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson-Wood|first1=Denis|last2=Lawson-Wood|first2=Joyce|title=Acupuncture Handbook|date=1983|publisher=Health Science Press|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing|date=November 2015}}

==Locations==
There are various [[sacred natural site]]s that people of various belief systems find [[numen|numinous]] or having an "energy" with significance to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivakhiv|first1=Adrian|title=Orchestrating Sacred Space: Beyond the 'Social Construction' of Nature|journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture|date=24 February 2007|volume=8|issue=1|pages=11–29|doi=10.1558/ecotheology.v8i1.1642|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~aivakhiv/Orchestrating_Sacred_Space.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2017|issn=1363-7320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that some kind of "negative energy" is responsible for creating or attracting [[ghost]]s or [[demon]]s appears in contemporary paranormal culture and beliefs as exemplified in the TV shows ''[[Paranormal State]]'' and ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]''.&lt;ref name="Fahy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fahy|first1=Thomas|title=The Philosophy of Horror|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=0813125731|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''''' (1957)—originally published in 1952 as '''''In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present'''''&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;—was [[Martin Gardner]]'s second book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dover - the publisher of the book's second edition - had published a collection of mathematical puzzles the year before, and Gardner had already written many articles throughout the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of what it described as [[pseudoscience]]s and cult beliefs, it became a founding document in the nascent [[scientific skepticism]] movement. [[Michael Shermer]] said of it: "Modern skepticism has developed into a science-based movement, beginning with Martin Gardner's 1952 classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|date=2002|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7089-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synopsis===
''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'' starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of "cranks" and "pseudo-scientists", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: "If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting ''questionable'' theses to be published".  Gardner acknowledges that "among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view", but adds that "a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable" because otherwise "science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along."

Gardner says that cranks have ''two'' common characteristics. The first "and most important" is that they work in almost total isolation from the [[scientific community]]. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published — such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; But the crank "stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent."

The second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are ''five'' ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested.

#The pseudo-scientist considers himself a genius.
#He regards other researchers as stupid, dishonest or both.
#He believes there is a campaign against his ideas, a campaign comparable to the persecution of [[Galileo]] or [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]. He may attribute his "persecution" to a conspiracy by a scientific "masonry" who are unwilling to admit anyone to their inner sanctum without appropriate initiation.
#Instead of side-stepping the mainstream, the pseudo-scientist attacks it head-on: The most revered scientist is [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] so Gardner writes that Einstein is the most likely establishment figure to be attacked.
#He has a tendency to use complex jargon, often making up words and phrases. Gardner compares this to the way that schizophrenics talk in what psychiatrists call "neologisms", "words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like [[Jabberwocky]] to everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular "fads" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. ''Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science'').

==History==
The 1957 [[Dover Publications|Dover]] publication is a revised and expanded version of ''In the Name of Science'', which was published by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in 1952.  The subtitle boldly states the book's theme: "The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them. A study in human gullibility". As of 2005, it had been reprinted at least 30 times.

The book was expanded from an article first published in the ''[[Antioch Review]]'' in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the preface to the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article as the starting point of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Not all material in the article is carried over to the book. For example, in the article, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And comments in a footnote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not within the scope of this paper, however, to discuss technical criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, but at the same time is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific "orthodoxy" may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of "pseudo-science." Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams touch only in the rarest of instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456, n.4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While in the book, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a detailed refutation.  “A fairly complete textbook of physics would be only part of the answer to Velikovsky,” writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his excellent article on “Cranks and Scientists” (''Scientific Monthly'', Nov., 1951), “and it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find the undertaking worth while.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the wrap-up of the chapter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as an experienced doctor is able to diagnose certain ailments the instant a new patient walks into his office, or a police officer learns to recognize criminal types from subtle behavior clues which escape the untrained eye, so we, perhaps, may learn to recognize the future scientific crank when we first encounter him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
A contemporary review in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' particularly welcomed Gardner's critical remarks about [[Hoxsey Therapy]] and about [[Krebiozen]], both of which were being advanced as anti-cancer measures at that time. The review concluded that the book "should help to counteract some amusing and some positively harmful cults, the existence of which is all too often promoted by irresponsible journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Study of the Strange Growth of Pseudo-Science |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t3xIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3392,2509292&amp;dq=in-the-name-of-science+gardner&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=November 16, 1957 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has often been mentioned in subsequent books and articles. [[Louis Lasagna]], in his book ''The Doctors' Dilemmas'', considered it to be a "superb account of scientific cults, fads, and frauds" and wrote that "This talented writer combines solid fact with a pleasing style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The doctors' dilemmas |last=Lasagna |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Lasagna |year=1970 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=292 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiLMdjrSFeEC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist of religion [[Anson D. Shupe]] took in general a positive attitude, and praises Gardner for his humor. But he says&lt;blockquote&gt;
If there is a single criticism to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like "quack", "crank" and "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always on the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.&lt;ref name=shupe&gt;{{cite book |title=Six perspectives on new religions: a case study approach |last= Shupe |first=Anson D.|authorlink= Anson D. Shupe |year=1981 |isbn= 0-88946-333-6 |publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press  |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhDcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1980s a fierce interchange took place between Gardner and [[Colin Wilson]].  In ''The Quest for Wilhelm Reich'' Wilson wrote of this book&lt;blockquote&gt;(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain ''he'' is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so ''sure'' that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] once remarked wryly "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling.&lt;ref name=reichquest&gt;{{cite book| title=The Quest for Wilhelm Reich| first=Colin| last=Wilson| authorlink=Colin Wilson| year=1981| publisher=Granada Publishing|pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence.&lt;ref name=NYRJune&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/15/ghosts-poltergeists/ letter, New York Review of Books, June 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' describing Wilson as "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene".&lt;ref name=NYRFeb&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/feb/16/paranormal-companionship/ letter, New York Review of Books, February 16, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of [[CSICOP]]—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...".&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt; Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..."&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt;

In a review of a subsequent Gardner work, Paul Stuewe of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called ''Fads and Fallacies'' a "hugely enjoyable demolition of pseudo-scientific nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics and biography make strange bedfellows |author=Paul Stuewe |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471222021.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+17,+1990&amp;author=Paul+Stuewe&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Politics+and+biography+make+strange+bedfellows&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=March 17, 1990 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered the book to be "the classic put-down of pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There's One Born Every Minute |author=Ed Regis  |authorlink=Ed Regis (author)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/04/reviews/000604.04regist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] called the book "''the'' skeptic classic of the past half-century." He noted that the mark of popularity for the book came when [[John W. Campbell]] denounced the chapter on dianetics over the radio.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The borderlands of science: where sense meets nonsense |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer|coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn= |page=50 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCanmmIb8QUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HPNYTcOpEMK4tgf5hdWWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Erickson, author of ''Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century'', noted that Gardner's book provided "a flavour of the immense optimism surrounding science in the 1950s" and that his choice of topics were "interesting", but also that his attacks on "osteopathy, chiropractice, and the Bates method for correcting eyesight would raise eyebrows amongst medical practitioners today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century |last=Erickson |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Polity |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=150–151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NgajQBd_6AC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BPtYTc27BIW4tweY54XVDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner’s own response to criticism is given in his preface:
:The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gemmotherapy''' [from Lat. ''gemma'', bud, and New Lat. ''therapīa'', Grk. ''therapeia'', medical treatment] is a form of [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] that uses remedies made principally from the embryonic tissue of various [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s (the [[bud]]s and emerging [[shoots]]), but also from the reproductive parts (the [[seed]]s and [[catkin]]s) and from newly grown tissue (the [[root]]lets and the [[root#root structure|cortex]] of rootlets).  In two instances, remedies are also made from the [[plant sap|sap]].

This raw material is taken  at the peak time of the tree or shrub’s annual [[germination]], in the spring for buds or the autumn for seeds. Certain plant hormones and enzymes are released during this process, and in some cases are only present in the plant at this time.

== Development and spread of gemmotherapy ==

The therapeutic effects of remedies made from the embryonic material of plants were first investigated in the late 1950s by a Belgian homeopath, Pol Henry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uygAyfa5Au8C&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=pol%20henry%20Gemmotherapie&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=pol%20henry |page=80 |title=Soigner le stress par l'homéopathie et la phytothérapie |author=Bernard Chemouny |publisher=Odile Jacob |date=2012 |isbn= 9782738178237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1918–88), working with a group of French [[homeopath]]s and biotherapists including Max Tétau (1927-2012) and O.A. Julian (1910–84). They conducted the first experiments as well as human and animal clinical trials that elucidated the effects of gemmotherapy and summarized their clinical findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bases Biologiques de la Gemmothérapie|last = Henry|first = Pol|publisher = Saint-Norbert|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Tongerlo, Belgium|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Conception de la Gemmotherapie|last = Tétau|first = Max|date = January 1959|journal = Archives Homéopathiques de Normandie |issn=0518-3391 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Observation clinique de Gemmotherapie|editor-last = Julian|editor-first = O.A.|date = January 1961|journal = Archives Homéopathiques de Normandie |doi = |pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry initially called the new type of medicine, phytoembryotherapy, but it was Tetau that later coined the phrase gemmotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Treatise on Gemmotherapy|last = Andrianne|first = Philippe|publisher = Editions Amyris SPRL|year = 2012|isbn = 978-2-8755-2012-8|location = Brussels, Belgium|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemmotherapy was included in herbal therapies in France in the ''Pharmacopée Francaise''&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmacopée Francaise'', 8th edition, Ministère de la Santé, Gouvernement Français, Paris 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4878">{{distinguish|Haldane's rule}}

In British research policy, the '''Haldane principle''' is the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians. It is named after [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy.

==Overview==
The 1904 committee recommended the creation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] which has evolved via the [[Universities Funding Council]] into the current higher education funding councils: [[Research Councils UK]], [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], [[Scottish Funding Council]] and [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]].

In 1918 Haldane's committee produced the "Haldane Report".  The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general.  It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas.  The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].

The principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years.  In 1939 [[J.D. Bernal]] argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research.  [[Solly Zuckerman]] criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former.

A major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.

There is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39078281 BBC 24 02 2017: Minister to enshrine protection for research independence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]], which merged the research councils and the research part of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] into [[UK Research and Innovation]], enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): ''The “Haldane principle” is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/section/103/enacted  Higher Education and Research Act 2017], legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12671">The '''Jadad scale''', sometimes known as '''Jadad scoring''' or the '''Oxford quality scoring system''', is a procedure to independently assess the methodological quality of a [[clinical trial]]. It is named after [[Colombia]]n physician [[Alex Jadad]] who in 1996 described a system for allocating the trial a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous). It is the most widely used such assessment in the world, and as of 2017, its seminal paper has been cited in over 13000 scientific works.

==Description==
The Jadad scale independently assesses the methodological quality of a [[clinical trial]] judging the effectiveness of [[Blind experiment|blinding]]. [[Alex Jadad|Alejandro "Alex" Jadad Bechara]], a Colombian physician who worked as a Research Fellow at the Oxford Pain Relief Unit, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, at the [[University of Oxford]] described the allocating trials a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous) scale in  an appendix to a 1996 paper.&lt;ref name="jadad"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Jadad | first= A.R. | authorlink=Alejandro R. Jadad Bechara |author2=Moore R.A. |author3=Carroll D. |author4=Jenkinson C. |author5=Reynolds D.J.M. |author6=Gavaghan D.J. |author7=McQuay H.J.  | title= Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: Is blinding necessary? |journal= Controlled Clinical Trials|volume=17 |issue=1 |pages= 1–12| doi= 10.1016/0197-2456(95)00134-4| year= 1996 | pmid=8721797}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2007 book Jadad described the randomised controlled trial as "one of the simplest, most powerful and revolutionary forms of research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jadad|first=Alejandro R.|author2=Enkin, Murray |title=Randomized Controlled Trials: Questions, Answers and Musings| publisher=Blackwell| year=2007| edition=2nd| isbn=978-1-4051-3266-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Randomised controlled trial}}
Clinical trials are conducted for the purpose of collecting data on the efficacy of medical treatments.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Shein-Chung|author2=Liu, Jen-pei|title=Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|page=2|isbn=978-0-471-24985-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMUEjZ4vyAC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment might be, for example, a new [[drug]], a [[medical device]], a [[surgical procedure]], or a preventative regime.&lt;ref name=chow/&gt; [[Clinical trial protocol]]s vary considerably depending on the nature of the treatment under investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brian |first=Everitt|author2=Pickles, Andrew|title=Statistical Aspects of the Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2004|page=5|isbn=978-1-86094-441-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMiH5y6SDuQC&amp;printsec=PPA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but typically in a controlled trial researchers gather a group of volunteers and subject some to the test treatment, while giving the others either no treatment (known as a [[placebo]]), or an established treatment for comparison. After a defined time period, the patients in the test group are assessed for health improvements in comparison with the [[control group]].

However, trials can vary greatly in quality. Methodological errors such as poor [[Blind experiment|blinding]] or poor [[randomisation]] allow factors such as the [[placebo effect]] or [[selection bias]] to adversely affect the results of a trial.&lt;ref name="Colditz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colditz|first=G.A.|author2=Miller J.N. |author3=Mosteller F. |year=1989|title=How study design affects outcomes in comparisons of therapy|journal=Statistics in Medicine | volume=8|issue=4|pages=441–454|doi=10.1002/sim.4780080408 | pmid = 2727468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Randomisation===
Randomisation is a process to remove potential distortion of statistical results arising from the manner in which the
trial is conducted, in particular in the selection of subjects. Studies have indicated, for example, that nonrandomised trials are more likely to show a positive result for a new treatment than for an established conventional one.&lt;ref name="Colditz"/&gt;

===Blinding===
The importance of [[scientific control]]s to limit factors under test is well established. However, it is also important that none of those involved in a clinical trial, whether the researcher, the subject patient or any other involved parties, should allow their own prior expectations to affect reporting of results.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Simon J |author2=Altman,  Douglas G |title=Blinding in clinical trials and other studies|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=321|issue=7259|page=504|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7259/504|pmid=10948038|year=2000|pmc=1118396|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7259.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[placebo effect]] is known to be a confounding factor in trials; affecting the ability of both patients and doctors to report accurately on the clinical outcome. [[Blind experiment|Experimental blinding]] is a process to prevent [[bias]], both conscious and subconscious, skewing results.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

Blinding frequently takes the form of a [[placebo]], an inactive dummy that is indistinguishable from the real treatment. Blinding can however be difficult to achieve in some trials,&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt; for example, [[surgery]] or [[physical therapy]]. Poor blinding can exaggerate the perceived effects of treatment, particularly if any such effects are small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The revised CONSORT statement for reporting randomized trials: explanation and elaboration | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | date=2001-04-17 | first=DG | last=Altman | first2=KF|last2=Schulz|first3=D|last3=Moher|first4=M|last4=Egger|first5=F|last5=Davidoff|first6=D|last6=Elbourne|first7=PC|last7=Gøtzsche|first8=T|last8=Lang|last9=CONSORT GROUP (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) | volume=134 | issue=8 |pages=663–694 | pmid=11304107 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-134-8-200104170-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blinding should be appropriate to the study, and is ideally [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double blind]], wherein neither the patient nor doctor is aware of whether they are in the control or test group, eliminating any such psychological effects from the study.

===Withdrawals and dropouts===
Withdrawals and [[dropping out|dropouts]] are those patients who fail to complete a course of treatment, or fail to report back on its outcome to the researchers. The reasons for doing so might be varied: the individuals may have moved away, abandoned the course of treatment, or died. Whatever the reason, the attrition rate can skew results of a study, particularly for those subjects who ceased treatment due to perceived inefficacy. In [[smoking cessation]] studies, for example, it is routine to consider all dropouts as failures.&lt;ref&gt;

==Jadad questionnaire==
A three-point questionnaire forms the basis for a Jadad score.&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt; Each question was to be answered with either a ''yes'' or a ''no''. Each ''yes'' would score a single point, each ''no'' zero points; there were to be no fractional points. The Jadad team stated that they expected it should take no longer than ten minutes to score any individual paper. The questions were as follows: ''Was the study described as randomized?'',  ''Was the study described as double blind?'' and ''Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

To receive the corresponding point, an article should describe the number of withdrawals and dropouts, in each of the study groups, and the underlying reasons. Additional points were given if: ''The method of randomisation was described in the paper, and that method was appropriate.'' or ''The method of blinding was described, and it was appropriate.''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

Points would be ''deducted'' if: ''The method of randomisation was described, but was inappropriate.'' or ''The method of blinding was described, but was inappropriate.''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

A clinical trial could therefore receive a Jadad score of between zero and five. The Jadad scale is sometimes described as a five-point scale, though there are only three questions.

==Uses==
The Jadad score may be used in a number of ways:

==Criticism==
Critics have charged that the Jadad scale is flawed, being over-simplistic and placing too much emphasis on blinding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=V.

[[Image:John Wilbanks 2.jpg|thumb|left|Wilbanks at the [[FreeCulture.org]] 2007 National Conference.]]

From 1994 to 1997, he worked in [[Washington, DC]] as a legislative aide to [[Pete Stark|Congressman Fortney "Pete" Stark]]. During this time Wilbanks was also a grassroots coordinator and fundraiser for the [[American Physical Therapy Association]].&lt;ref name="berkman"/&gt; Wilbanks was the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]]'s first assistant director from the fall of 1998 to the summer of 2000. There he led efforts in software development and [[Electronic learning|Internet-mediated learning]], and was involved in the Berkman Center's work on [[ICANN]].&lt;ref name="berkman"/&gt;

While at the Berkman Center, Wilbanks founded Incellico, Inc., a bioinformatics company that built semantic graph networks for use in pharmaceutical research and development. He served as President and [[CEO]], and led to the company's acquisition in the summer of 2003.&lt;ref name="berkman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cc people"/&gt; He has also served as a Fellow at the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] on Semantic Web for Life Sciences, was a Visiting Scientist in the Project on Mathematics and Computation at MIT,&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/mac/mac-people.html Project on Mathematics and Computation]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the National Advisory Committee for [[PubMed Central]].&lt;ref name="berkman"/&gt; He is a member of the Board of Directors for [[Sage Bionetworks]]&lt;ref name="sagebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sagebase.org/info/directors.php |title=Sage Bionetworks Seattle &amp;#124; Directors |format= |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65NAfFu20?url=http://sagebase.org/info/directors.php |archivedate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the advisory boards of Genomera, Genomic Arts, and Boundless Learning. He is an original author of the [[Panton Principles]] for sharing data.

===Consent To Research===

[[Consent to Research]] (CtR) is a project that provides a platform for people to donate their health data for the purposes of scientific research and the advancement of medicine. Since health data is restricted and expensive, this project provides people the opportunity to freely donate information that can only positively benefit medicine and patients at large.&lt;ref name="Consent to Research - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weconsent.us/about|title=Consent to Research - About Us|publisher=Consent to Research|accessdate=2012-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629212121/http://weconsent.us/about|archivedate=2012-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consent to Research is connected to the Access2Research project, which aims to free access over the Internet to scientific journal articles that are already taxpayer-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access2research.org/about|title=Access2Research - About Us|publisher=Access2Research|accessdate=2013-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524034409/http://access2research.org/about|archive-date=2012-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilbanks founded the project in 2011 and gave a TED Global talk about the project in 2012.&lt;ref name="TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at [[TED Global Conference|TED Global]] 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/29/unreasonable-people-unite-john-wilbanks-at-tedglobal-2012/|title=TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at TED Global 2012|publisher=TED|accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Journal NPCA title page 1800.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Title page of 1799-1800 volume&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''''A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts''''', generally known as ''Nicholson's Journal'', was the first monthly  scientific journal in Great Britain. [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] began it in 1797&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Iain P. Watts|title='We want no authors': William Nicholson and the contested role of the scientific journal in Britain, 1797–1813|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|pages=397–419|url=http://www.princeton.edu/histgrads/profiles/iwatts/Iain-Watts-We-Want-No-Authors.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014|doi=10.1017/s0007087413000964|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the editor until it merged with another journal at the end of 1813.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Nicholson, William (1753-1815) (DNB00)|"Nicholson, William (1753–1815)"]]. [[Dictionary of National Biography]]. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1885–1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson's journal would accept short papers, written by new or anonymous authors, and decide whether to publish them relatively quickly. These attributes distinguished the new journal from the established scientific journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''. By one account this less-formal model was so appealing that the next year a similar startup launched, [[Alexander Tilloch]]'s ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;Russell, Colin. Enterprise and electrolysis... ''Chemistry World'', Aug. 2003 ([http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/August/electrolysis.asp online])&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nicholson and [[Anthony Carlisle]] split water into hydrogen and oxygen for the first time in 1800 and immediately published their results in the journal. They used [[Volta's pile]] (an electric battery) as soon as they learned of it to achieve this [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Hasok. 2012.

* Discovery of the element [[palladium]] was announced in 1803. The author chose Nicholson's journal in order to remain anonymous at first, and later revealed himself to be [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;
* The journal published the first known [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] analysis of [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[heavier-than-air]] [[fixed-wing]] [[flying machines]] designs, by [[George Cayley]] in 1809-1810.&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;Cayley, George. "On Aerial Navigation" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810. (Via [[NASA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing business ==
By one account, William Nicholson started the journal and made all editorial decisions in a "pioneering and uncertain attempt" to make a living from publishing it. Revenues came only from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=cwl&gt;Chang, 2012, p. 73, also citing Lilley (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Tilloch's ''Philosophical Magazine'' was more successful as a popular science journal business than Nicholson's journal, according to one source, and another such journal appeared in 1813 (''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'').&lt;ref name=cw/&gt; Possibly partly because of this competition, William Nicholson ended the journal. By some accounts Nicholson's journal simply ceased, and by others it merged in 1814 with the ''Philosophical Magazine'' to form ''The Philosophical Magazine and Journal''.

The "Advertisement", dated 31 December 1813, at the start of Volume 42 of ''The Philosophical Magazine'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53080#page/20/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; states:

"Nearly seventeen years have elapsed since ''The Philosophical Journal'' was commenced by Mr. Nicholson, and sixteen since the appearance of the first number of ''The Philosophical Magazine''. [...] [T]he result of [...] deliberations [between the publishers of ''Nicholson's Philosophical Journal'' and ''The Philosophical Magazine'' in order to respond to readers' complaints regarding duplication of material in the two publications] has been that it would certainly be best that we should unite, and that the joint product of our exertions and our correspondence should be consolidated in one periodical work. [...] The Philosophical Journal will henceforth be discontinued; and The Philosophical Magazine will be conducted by William Nicholson and Alexander Tilloch, in the same manner as it has always been carried on."

For the duration of Volume 43 (January to June 1814) the joint publishers of the new merged journal provided duplicate title-pages for each number, ostensibly so that subscribers to ''Nicholson's Philosophical Magazine'' might be enabled to "preserve their Series without a chasm." However, despite their intention to continue this scheme of two-fold numeration, they abandoned it at the end of this trial period in June 1814, because of the perceived "confusion and risque of many errors" when referring to future volumes; from July 1814 a single numeration was used, following the numbering of ''The Philosophical Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53078#page/15/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="894">A '''land lab''' is an area of land that has been set aside for use in [[biology|biological]] studies.  Thus, it is literally an outdoor laboratory based on an area of land.

Studies may be elementary or advanced.  For instance, students may simply be given the task of identifying all the [[tree]] species in a land lab, or an advanced student may be doing an intensive survey of the microbial life forms found in a [[soil]] sample.

Land labs are often marked out in plots or [[transect]]s for studies.  A plot may be any size, usually marked out in square meters.  This allows for more intensive, delimited studies of changes and inventories of [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  Transects are straight lines at which, at intervals, measurements are taken for a profile of the [[ecology|ecological]] community.

[[File:LifeAndEnergy.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]])]]

'''''Life and Energy''''' is a 1962 book by [[Isaac Asimov]]. It is about the [[biology|biological]] and [[physics|physical]] [[world]], and their contrasts and comparisons. Thus the book is divided into two sections, which is separated by further sub-sections (i.e. chapters): 1) energy; 2) body. In order to accomplish its goal, the book starts with "layman" discussions about energy and how these can be used to single out human from other living systems, or even living systems from non-living matter, what differentiates a rock from an oyster, and finishes with advanced concepts, how living systems are able to "produce" energy.

==First Chapters: Energy==
The first chapters covers the common questions of the distinctions between [[life|living]] and inanimate objects.

==Following Chapters==
Asimov then explains in a step by step manner about the physical world first through slow, but interesting chapters. He writes about the effect and major role of the [[evolution]] and advance of [[man]] by [[fire]] and heat, he tells about [[thermodynamics]] (and its laws), he recollects the thoughts of previous scientists, and their painstaking works, and finally, the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[radiation]], which has revolutionised physics and [[technology]]. An explanation of [[electricity]] and basic [[chemistry]] laws and features are also included.
The physical section ends here, and continues into biology. He now continues on with special chemistry, and leaves behind physics. From this, the book leads into the functions of [[enzyme]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[biological cell|cells]], the body as a whole, and the process of the cells and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s to work together to become one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39445">[[Citizen science]] projects are activities sponsored by a wide variety of organizations so non-scientists can meaningfully contribute to scientific research.  Activities vary widely from transcribing old ship logbooks to digitize the data as part of the [[Old Weather]] project to observing and counting birds at home or in the field for [[eBird]].&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite news|last=Mapes|first=Lynda V.|title=Citizen scientists can be climate sleuths too|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020373355_citizensciencexml.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=Jim|title=Crowdsourcing, for the birds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/crowdsourcing-for-the-birds.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation can be as simple as playing a computer game for a project called [[Eyewire]] that may help scientists learn more about [[retina]]l [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: EyeWire|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/project.cfm?id=update-eyewire-mit|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be more in depth, such as when citizens collect water quality data over time to assess the health of local waters, or help discover and name new species of insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schilthuizen|first=Menno|last2=Seip|first2=Lilian|last3=Otani|first3=Sean|last4=Suhaimi|first4=Jadda|last5=Njunjić|first5=Iva|date=2017-06-12|title=Three new minute leaf litter beetles discovered by citizen scientists in Maliau Basin, Malaysian Borneo (Coleoptera: Leiodidae, Chrysomelidae)|url=https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e21947|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.3897/bdj.5.e21947|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://acwi.gov/monitoring/vm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging branch of Citizen Science are Community Mapping projects that utilize smartphone and tablet technology. For example, TurtleSAT&lt;ref&gt;http://turtlesat.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; is a community mapping project that is mapping freshwater turtle deaths throughout Australia.

Lists of citizen science projects may change. For example, the Old Weather project website indicates that {{As of|2015|01|10|alt=as of}} January 10, 2015, 51% of the logs were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=old Weather|url=http://www.oldweather.org/|publisher=Zooniverse|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When that project reaches 100 percent, it will move to the completed list.

There are more than 1,100 active and searchable global citizen science projects listed on the [[SciStarter]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scistarter.com SciStarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hilbert's tenth problem]]

'''Hilbert's tenth problem''' is the tenth on the [[Hilbert's problems|list of mathematical problems]] that the German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed in 1900.  It is the challenge to provide a general [[algorithm]] which, for any given [[Diophantine equation]] (a [[polynomial]] equation with [[integer]] coefficients and a finite number of unknowns) can decide whether the equation has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values. 

For example, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;3x^2-2xy-y^2z-7=0&lt;/math&gt; has an integer solution: &lt;math&gt;x=1,\ y=2,\ z=-2&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt; has no such solution.

Hilbert's tenth problem has been solved, and it has a negative answer: such a general algorithm does not exist. This is the result of combined work of [[Martin Davis]], [[Yuri Matiyasevich]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Julia Robinson]] which spans 21 years, with Yuri Matiyasevich completing the theorem in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Barry Cooper]], ''Computability theory'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is now known as [[Matiyasevich's theorem]] or the MRDP theorem.

;[[Three-gap theorem]]
The three-gap theorem states that if one places ''n'' points on a circle, at angles of ''&amp;theta;'', 2''&amp;theta;'', 3''&amp;theta;'' ... from the starting point, then there will be at most three distinct distances between pairs of points in adjacent positions around the circle.

;[[Noether normalization lemma]]

The Noether normalization lemma is a result of [[commutative algebra]], introduced by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that for any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', and any [[Finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] commutative [[algebra over a field|''k''-algebra]] ''A'', there exists a nonnegative integer ''d'' and [[algebraically independent]] elements ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' 
such that ''A'' is a finitely generated module over  the polynomial ring ''S'':=''k''[''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;].

The theorem has a geometric interpretation. Suppose ''A'' is integral. Let ''S'' be the [[coordinate ring]] of the ''d''-dimensional [[affine space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;, and ''A'' as the coordinate ring of some other ''d''-dimensional [[affine variety]] ''X''.  Then the [[inclusion map]] ''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A'' induces a surjective [[finite morphism]] of [[affine varieties]] &lt;math&gt;X\to \mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;. The conclusion is that any [[affine variety]] is a [[branched covering]] of affine space.

The [[Noether normalization lemma]] is an important step to proving Hilbert's [[Nullstellensatz]].

;[[Noether's theorem]]

'''Noether's''' ('''first''')&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Noether's second theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''theorem''' states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the [[action (physics)|action]] of a physical system has a corresponding [[conservation law]].

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

;[[isomorphism theorems]]

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[abstract algebra]], the '''isomorphism theorems''' are three [[theorem]]s that describe the relationship between [[quotient]]s, [[homomorphism]]s, and [[subobject]]s.  Versions of the theorems exist for [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[vector space]]s, [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[Lie algebra]]s, and various other [[algebraic structure]]s.  In [[universal algebra]], the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.

The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by [[Emmy Noether]] in her paper ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'' which was published in 1927 in [[Mathematische Annalen]].  Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of [[Richard Dedekind]] and previous papers by Noether.

Three years later, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]] published his influential ''Algebra,'' the first [[abstract algebra]] textbook that took the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]-[[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]-[[Field (mathematics)|fields]] approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on [[group theory]] and [[Emil Artin]] on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], [[Otto Schreier]], and van der Waerden himself on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called ''homomorphism theorem'', and ''two laws of isomorphism'' when applied to groups, appear explicitly.

;[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lasker–Noether theorem''' states that every [[Noetherian ring]] is a '''Lasker ring''', which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called '''primary decomposition''', of finitely many ''[[primary ideal]]s'' (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of [[prime ideal]]s).  The theorem was first proven by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emanuel Lasker|first=Emanuel|last= Lasker|year= 1905}} for the special case of [[polynomial ring]]s and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emmy Noether|first=Emmy |last=Noether|year= 1921}}.

The Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and more generally the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in [[algebraic geometry]], by asserting that every [[algebraic set]] may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of [[irreducible component]]s.

;[[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]]

In [[algebraic number theory]], the '''Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem''' states that a [[central simple algebra]] over an [[algebraic number field]] ''K'' which splits over every [[local field|completion]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[matrix ring|matrix algebra]] over ''K''. The theorem is an example of a [[local-global principle]] in [[algebraic number theory]] and 
leads to a complete description of finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over algebraic number fields in terms of their [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|local invariants]]. It was proved independently by [[Richard Brauer]], [[Helmut Hasse]], and [[Emmy Noether]] and by [[Abraham Adrian Albert]].

Transposons make up a large fraction of the DNA in eukaryotic cells (44% if the human genome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mills, R.E., Bennett, E.A., Iskow, R.C. and Devine, S.E. | year =  2007 | title = Which transposable elements are active in the human genome? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 183–191 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.02.006| pmid =  17331616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of the maize genome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=SanMiguel P, Tikhonov A, Jin YK |displayauthors=etal |title=Nested retrotransposons in the intergenic regions of the maize genome |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5288 |pages=765–8 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8864112 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8864112 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5288.765|bibcode=1996Sci...274..765S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiao|first=Yinping|last2=Peluso|first2=Paul|last3=Shi|first3=Jinghua|last4=Liang|first4=Tiffany|last5=Stitzer|first5=Michelle C.|last6=Wang|first6=Bo|last7=Campbell|first7=Michael S.|last8=Stein|first8=Joshua C.|last9=Wei|first9=Xuehong|date=2017-06-22|title=Improved maize reference genome with single-molecule technologies|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v546/n7659/full/nature22971.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=546|issue=7659|pages=524–527|doi=10.1038/nature22971|pmid=28605751|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.546..524J}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and  play an important role in genome function and evolution. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucher E, Reinders J, Mirouze M |date=Nov 2012 |title=Epigenetic control of transposon transcription and mobility in ''Arabidopsis'' |journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=503–10 |pmid=22940592 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2012.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Stichotrich|''Oxytricha'']], which has a unique genetic system, these elements play a critical role in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090520140408.htm |title='Junk' DNA Has Important Role, Researchers Find |work=Science Daily |date=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Nerve growth factor]]
[[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] and colleague [[Stanley Cohen (biochemist)|Stanley Cohen]] discovered nerve growth factor, a [[neurotrophic factor]] and [[neuropeptide]] primarily involved in the regulation of growth, maintenance, proliferation, and survival of certain target [[neurons]]. This discovery was recognized with the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1986.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1986|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1986/|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Telomerase]]

[[Elizabeth Blackburn]], [[Carol W. Greider]], and [[Jack W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''Mapping controversies''' (MC) is an academic course taught in [[science studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Hess, DJ. Science Studies: An Advanced Introduction. NYU Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from the writings of the French sociologist and philosopher [[Bruno Latour]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; MC focuses exclusively on the [[scientific controversy|controversies surrounding scientific knowledge]] rather than the established scientific facts or outcomes. Thus, it helps sociologists, anthropologists and other social scientists get insights not into scientific knowledge ''per se'', but rather into ''the process of gaining knowledge''. Thus, MC sheds light on those intermediate stages corresponding to the actual research process and pinpoints the connections between scientific work and other types of activities.

==History==
The term "mapping controversies"  was first suggested in relation to analysis of scientific and technological controversies,&lt;ref&gt;Latour., B. Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and then lately re-affirmed as a widely applicable methodological approach going beyond the boundaries of Science Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used for the methodology that identifies and tracks down the polemics or debate surrounding a scientific fact, and utilises various visualisation tools to present the problem in its complexity.

Recently Latour initiated the project "Mapping Controversies on Science for Politics (MACOSPOL)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macospol.eu MACOSPOL] www.macospol.eu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; The showcase website is mappingcontroversies.net &lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.net/Home/AboutMacospol www.mappingcontroversies.net  Retrieved on 2009-12-21 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008-2009 several universities in Europe and USA started teaching "Mapping Controversies" courses for students in political sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/projets/teaching-controversy-mapping/ Média Lab Sciences Po] sciences-po.fr Retrieved on 2017-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier attempt to stage controversies in museum settings took place at the [http://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2005/forum2005/docs/mapping_controversies_report.pdf Gallery of Research] in Vienna in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Yaneva, A., Rabesandratana, T., Greiner, B. Staging Scientific Controversies: a Gallery Test on Science Museums’ Interactivity, Public Understanding of Science 2009, 18(1): [http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/0963662507077512v1 79-90].&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of a term often refers to an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[Medical condition|condition]]. For example, in the disorder [[hypertension]], the prefix "hyper-" means "high" or "over", and the root word "tension" refers to pressure, so the word "hypertension" refers to abnormally high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology attribution"&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=by4|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24}} {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|id=ID: 14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|isbn=978-1-93-816813-0|date=February 26, 2016|at=1.6. Anatomical Terminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots, prefixes and suffixes are often derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Latin]], and often quite dissimilar from their English-language variants.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@6.11|title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|id=ID: 14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@6.11|isbn=978-1-93-816813-0|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2013|at=1.6. Anatomical Terminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regular morphology means that once a reasonable number of [[morphemes]] are learnt it becomes easy to understand very precise terms assembled from these morphemes. A lot of medical language is [[anatomical terminology]], concerning itself with the names of various parts of the body.

==Discussion==
In forming or understanding a [[word root]], one needs a basic comprehension of the terms and the source language. The study of the origin of words is called [[etymology]]. For example, if a word was to be formed to indicate a condition of kidneys, there are two primary roots &amp;ndash; one from Greek (νεφρός ''nephr(os)'') and one from Latin (''ren(es)''). [[Renal failure]] would be a condition of [[kidney]]s, and [[nephritis]] is also a condition, or inflammation, of the kidneys. The suffix ''-itis'' means inflammation, and the entire word conveys the meaning inflammation of the kidney. To continue using these terms, other combinations will be presented for the purpose of examples: The term ''supra-renal'' is a combination of the prefix ''supra-'' (meaning "above"), and the word root for kidney, and the entire word means "situated above the kidneys". The word "[[nephrologist]]" combines the root word for kidney to the suffix ''-ologist'' with the resultant meaning of "one who studies the kidneys".

The formation of plurals should usually be done using the rules of forming the proper plural form in the source language. Greek and Latin each have differing rules to be applied when forming the plural form of the word root. Often such details can be found using a [[medical dictionary]].

== Morphology ==
{{Main article|Morphology (linguistics)|List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes}}
Medical terminology often uses words created using [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. In [[medicine]], their meanings, and their [[etymology]], are informed by the language of origin. Prefixes and suffixes, primarily in Greek—but also in Latin, have a dropable ''-o-''. Medical roots generally go together according to language: Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes. Although it is technically considered acceptable to create hybrid words, it is strongly preferred not to mix different lingual roots. Examples of well-accepted medical words that do mix lingual roots are [[neonatology]] and [[quadriplegia]].

''Prefixes'' do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an ''in-'' may change to ''im-'' or ''syn-'' to ''sym-''.

''Suffixes'' are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.

In the process of creating medical terminology, certain [[rules of language]] apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called [[linguistics]].  The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a [[combining form]]. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter ''-o-'', added to the word root. For example if there is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, this would be written as ''gastro-'' and ''enter-'' plus ''-itis'', [[gastroenteritis]].

Suffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Micro-Pulling-Down-Method.png|thumb|right|Micro-pulling-down method]] --&gt;
The '''micro-pulling-down (µ-PD)''' method is a [[crystal growth]] technique based on continuous transport of the melted substance through micro-channel(s) made in a [[crucible]] bottom.  Continuous [[solidification]] of the melt is progressed on a liquid/solid interface positioned under the crucible.  In a steady state, both the melt and the crystal are pulled-down with a constant (but generally different) [[velocity]].

Many different types of crystal are grown by this technique, including  [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[silicon|Si]], [[Silicon-germanium|Si-Ge]], [[Lithium niobate|LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 
[[Sapphire|α-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Yttria|Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Scandium(III) oxide|Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 
[[Lithium fluoride|LiF]], [[Calcium fluoride|CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Barium fluoride|BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shaped Crystals: Growth by Micro-Pulling-Down Technique |editors=T.

==Crystal growth routine==
Standard routine procedure used in the growth of most of µ-PD crystals is well developed.  The general stages of the growths include:

*	charging of the crucible with starting materials (mixture of powders),
*	heating of the crucible until starting materials in the crucible are completely melted,
*	upward displacement of the seed until its contact with the meniscus or crucible,
*	formation of the meniscus and partial melting of the seed top,
*	correction of the shape of the meniscus through appropriate adjustment of crucible temperature and position of the seed crystal,
*	crystal growth through pulling of the seed in downward direction,
*	separation of the as grown crystal from the meniscus,
*	and cooling of the system (including the crystal and the crucible) to room temperature

'''Mien Shiang''' is a 3,000-year-old [[Taoist]] practice that means literally face (mien) reading (shiang). In just moments, one can supposedly determine anyone’s ''"[[Wu Xing]]"'' — Five Element personality type — their character, behavior, and health potential — by analyzing their face. The Taoist Five Elements, [[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], are metaphors devised by the ancient Taoist philosophers to explain the relationship, interaction, and ongoing change of everything in the Universe.&lt;ref name="mien" /&gt; In recent times the art of Face Reading is becoming more and more popular. Schools that teach Mien Shiang are becoming more wide spread.&lt;ref name="classes" /&gt;

The '''''Nature of Man Series''''' is a four-volume series of works in [[paleoanthropology]] by the prolific playwright, screenwriter, and science writer [[Robert Ardrey]]. The books in the series were published between 1961 and 1976.

The series majorly undermined standing assumptions in social sciences, leading to an abandonment of the "[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]" hypothesis; incited a renaissance in the science of [[ethology]]; and led to widespread popular interest in [[human evolution]] and [[Anthropogeny|human origins]].

The first work, ''[[African Genesis]]'' (1961), particularly helped revive interest in ethology, and was a direct precursor to the [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), [[Desmond Morris]]'s ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' (1967), [[Lionel Tiger]]'s ''Men in Groups'' (1969), and Tiger and [[Robin Fox]]'s ''The Imperial Animal'' (1971). The director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Human Origins|Human Origins Program]] [[Rick Potts]], cited Ardrey's work as inspiring him to go anthropology.&lt;ref name="Anthronotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/outreach/anthnote/Summer99/anthnote.html |title=Human Origins: One Man's Search for the Causes in Time |last=Selig | first=Ruth Osterweis |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |website=Anthronotes |access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works were wildly popular and influenced the public imagination. Stanley Kubrick cited them as major influences in developing his films [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] (1968) and [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] (1971).&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley.

Clarke]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert Ardrey==
{{main article|Robert Ardrey}}
Robert Ardrey was a prolific [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]], and [[science writing|science writer]]. By the time he returned to the sciences in the 1950s, he had already had a decorated [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] career, including the award of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]&lt;ref name="About"&gt;The Robert Ardrey Estate Website. [http://www.robertardrey.com/about/ "About"]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for best screenplay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{IMDb title | 0060588 | ''Khartoum''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Ardrey travelled to [[Africa]], where he wrote a series of articles for [[The Reporter (magazine)|''The Reporter'']].&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). "The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography" (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} At the same time he renewed an acquaintance with prominent geologist [[Richard Foster Flint]] and investigated claims made by [[Raymond Dart]] about a specimen of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|119}} This trip would initiate the decades of work Ardrey completed in the field of human evolution.

==African Genesis (1961)==
{{main article|African Genesis}}
The central thesis of ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man'' was that early man evolved from carnivorous African predecessors, and not, as was then the scientific consensus, from Asian herbivores.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGkindle"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/African-Genesis-Personal-Investigation-Origins/dp/0988604302 Kindle Edition Description via Amazon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It drew particularly on the scientific work of [[Raymond Dart]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]. This thesis has been proven and is now scientific doctrine.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

''African Genesis'' also challenged a key methodological assumption of the social sciences, namely that human behavior was distinct from animal behavior. Ardrey instead asserted that evolutionarily inherited traits were a major factor in determining human behavior. This was a hugely controversial hypothesis, though it has gained widespread acceptance today. It was a major theme that would extend throughout the ''Nature of Man'' books and continue to surround them with controversy.

''African Genesis'' was a major popular success. It was an international bestseller translated into dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2014"&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.'' 2014. New York: Ecco. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 it was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Via the National Book Award [https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine named ''African Genesis'' the most notable nonfiction book of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941837,00.html ''Time" Friday, Dec. 26, 1969. List accessible online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Territorial Imperative (1966)==
{{main article|The Territorial Imperative}}
''The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry Into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations'' extends Ardrey's work in examining the effects of inherited evolutionary traits on human social behavior with an emphasis on the hold that territory has on man. In particular it demonstrates the influence of the drive to possess territory on such phenomena as property ownership and nation-building.&lt;ref name=ditext&gt;{{cite web| title=The Territorial Imperative| publisher=Digital Text International| accessdate=2012-03-24| url=http://www.ditext.com/ardrey/imperative/imperative.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Territorial Imperative'' further developed the nascent science of [[ethology]] and increased public interest in human origins.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Hunt, George P. "Provocateur in Anthropology." ''Time'' 26 August 1966: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeSept70Q"&gt;Graves, Ralph. "A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory." ''Time'' 11 September 1970: 1. Print: "Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey, who describes himself as a 'scientific amateur,' today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''African Genesis'' it was also an international bestseller and saw translation into dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2014"/&gt; It influenced several notable figures. [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey as an inspiration for his films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D.

==The Social Contract (1970)==
{{main article|The Social Contract (1970 book)}}
''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' is the most controversial book of the ''Nature of Man'' series.&lt;ref name=Sci2&gt;Davis, Steve. "The Richard Dawkins Dilemma - Illusions of Natural Selection." From Science 2.0. Posted 15 September 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2015. Available [http://www.science20.com/gadfly/blog/richard_dawkins_dilemma_illusions_natural_selection-32425 here].&lt;/ref&gt; It sought to apply evolutionary thinking to the creation of social order. In particular it examined inherited characteristics' effects in determining hierarchy and inequality.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder.'' New York: Atheneum. 1970. 405 pp. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Humans&gt;Stade, George. "Humans Act, Animals Behave: The Social Contract." ''The New York Times,'' 22 November 1970. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Ardrey argued that, while inequality was not necessarily a social evil, it could only be justly expressed under conditions of absolute equality of opportunity. He also argued that the presence of inequality does not justify the domination of the weak by the strong.&lt;ref name=Sci2 /&gt; "Ardrey showed that in all societies at any level of the animal world, structures exist to protect the vulnerable, and that this is an evolutionary advantage as it protects diversity, diversity being essential for creativity."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Steve.

Posted 15 September 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Social Contract'' continued Ardrey's refutation of cultural determinists through interwoven analyses of animal and human behavior. It also emphasized the importance of a reasoned respect for nature, foreshadowing the environmental concerns of ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''&lt;ref&gt;"The philosophy of the impossible has been the dominant motive in human affairs for the past two centuries. We have pursued the mastery of nature as if we ourselves were not a portion of that nature. We have boasted of our command over our physical environment while we ourselves have done our urgent best to destroy it." Ardrey, Robert (2014-05-15). The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder (Robert Ardrey's Nature of Man series) (Kindle Locations 47-49). StoryDesign LTD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hunting Hypothesis (1976)==
{{main article|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
''The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man'' continued Ardrey's examination of the importance of inherited evolutionary traits. In particular it demonstrated the determinant force of traits that co-evolved in early man with hunting behavior.

At the time of publication, it was not even commonly accepted that early man were hunters, much less that hunting behavior influenced their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Human Origins Part Two." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 10 June 1997. Transcript available [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2107hum2.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of Ardrey's work this thesis gained support and eventually widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;"Becoming Human Part 2." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 31, August, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;"For decades researchers have been locked in debate over how and when hunting began and how big a role it played in human evolution. Recent analyses of human anatomy, stone tools and animal bones are helping to fill in the details of this game-changing shift in subsistence strategy. This evidence indicates that hunting evolved far earlier than some scholars had envisioned – and profoundly impacted subsequent human evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kate. "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/ How Hunting Made Us Human]". ''Scientific American,'' Volume 310, Issue 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis'' was also one of the first books to warn about [[climate change]] as a possible existential threat to mankind.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis,'' with some exceptions, was remarkably well reviewed. The famed biologist and naturalist [[E. O. Wilson]], the noted anthropologist [[Colin Turnbull]], the acclaimed journalist [[Max Lerner]], and the noteworthy social scientist [[Roger Masters]], among others, all wrote effusive reviews.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O.

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1 = Pfenninger | first1 = Stefan

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker
 | date = 21 November 2016
 | title = Energy databases: protection and licensing
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwaelte

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09
 | date = 10 December 2017
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d659fda325438884e6e78b372772ed7069633f97.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The same data is usually also provided as [[Office Open XML|XLSX]] ([[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) and [[SQLite]] files.  The datasets can be accessed in real-time using stable [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts deployed for data processing are available on [[GitHub]] and carry an [[MIT license]].  The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).  OpenEI also uses LOD methods to populate its definitions throughout the wiki with real-time connections to [[DBPedia]], [[#reegle|reegle]], and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"&gt;

OpenGridMap employs [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to gather detailed data on electricity network components and then infer a realistic network structure using methods from [[Correlation and dependence|statistics]] and [[graph theory]].  The scope of the project is worldwide and both distribution and transmission networks can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].  The project is managed by the Chair of Business Information Systems, [https://www.in.tum.de/en.html TUM Department of Informatics], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and a [[Facebook]] page and provides an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app]] to help the public document electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s and [[Electrical substation|substations]].  The bulk of the data is being made available under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] {{nowrap|CC BY 3.0 IGO}} license.&lt;ref name="opengridmap-terms-of-use"&gt;

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

'''Pseudoscience''' consists of statements, [[belief]]s, or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual, but are incompatible with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Definition:
* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.
* "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), '[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.' These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific."&lt;ref name="SEP section SciPse"/&gt;
* '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility"(p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation"(p. 17)'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shermer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this was the [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm definition adopted by] the [[National Science Foundation]])}} Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable claims]]; reliance on [[confirmation bias]] rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories, and continued adherence long after they have been experimentally discredited. The term ''pseudoscience'' is considered [[pejorative]]&lt;ref name="Freitsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frietsch|first1=Ute|name-list-format=vanc|title=The boundaries of science / pseudoscience|journal=European History Online (EGO)|date=7 April 2015|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|access-date=15 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202501/http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively. Those described as practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization.&lt;ref name="SEP section SciPse"&gt;{{citation |chapter-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science |chapter = Science and Pseudoscience |at= Section 2: The "science" of pseudoscience |title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year = 2008 |first = Sven Ove |last = Hansson | name-list-format = vanc |ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] between science and pseudoscience has [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] implications.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt; Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[occult]] beliefs, and [[creation science]], is part of science education and [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt;

Pseudoscience can cause negative consequences in the real world. [[Antivaccine]] activists present pseudoscientific studies that falsely call into question the safety of vaccines. [[Homeopathy|Homeopathic]] remedies with no active ingredients have been promoted as treatment for deadly diseases.

==Etymology==
The word ''pseudoscience'' is derived from the Greek root ''pseudo'' meaning false&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Free Dictionary |chapter=pseudo |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |year=2015 |chapter-url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudo |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url = https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pseudo |year=2015 |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the English word ''science'', from the Latin word ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g. in 1796 by [[James Pettit Andrews]] in reference to alchemy&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Andrews|Henry|1796|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the earliest uses of "pseudo-science" was in an 1844 article in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', issue 387:
{{quote|text=That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.}}

An earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[François Magendie]].&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Magendie F  |year=1843 |title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=Harper |page=150 |ref=harv |others=John Revere}} Magendie refers to phrenology as "''a pseudo-science of the present day''"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Still/&gt; --&gt; From time-to-time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.&lt;ref name=Still&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265–90 |title=The Social Psychology of "Pseudoscience": A Brief History | vauthors = Still A, Dryden W | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Philosophers classify types of [[knowledge]].  In English, the word ''[[science]]'' is used to indicate specifically the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and related fields, which are called the [[Social science|social sciences]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different philosophers of science may disagree on the exact limits – for example, is mathematics a [[formal science]] that is closer to the empirical ones, or is pure mathematics closer to the philosophical study of [[logic]] and therefore not a science?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory|author=Bunge, Mario Augusto|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7658-0413-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but all agree that all of the ideas that are not scientific are non-scientific.  The large category of [[non-science]] includes all matters outside the natural and social sciences, such as the study of [[history]], [[metaphysics]], [[religion]], [[art]], and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dividing the category again, unscientific claims are a subset of the large category of non-scientific claims.  This category specifically includes all matters that are directly opposed to good science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Unscience|Un-science]] includes both [[Bad science (philosophy)|bad science]] (such as an error made in a good-faith attempt at learning something about the natural world) and pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus pseudoscience is a subset of un-science, and un-science, in turn, is subset of non-science.

==Relationship to science==
Pseudoscience is differentiated from science because – although it claims to be science – pseudoscience does not adhere to accepted scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and Mertonian norms.

===Scientific method===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:The_Scientific_Method_(simple).png|thumb|The scientific method is a continuous cycle of hypothesis, prediction, testing and questioning.]]
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th-century [[phrenology]] chart: During the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul. Their idea of reading "bumps" in the skull to predict personality traits was later discredited.&lt;ref name="bowler"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bowler J |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |ref=harv |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrenology was first termed a pseudoscience in 1843 and continues to be considered so.&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"/&gt;]]

A number of basic principles are accepted by scientists as standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–5 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, "Probability", and Chapter 7, "inductive Logic and Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; are also important tools for the scientific method.

===Falsifiability===
{{Main|Falsifiability}}
During the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. No matter what test you think you can devise, there is then a reason why this does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; "Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?". He states that "your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].

===Mertonian norms===
{{Main|Mertonian norms}}
During 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five "norms" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:
* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.
* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.
* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.
* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.
* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Paradigms Lost"&gt;{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science|year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=51–52 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal to acknowledge problems===
During 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of "belief fields" and "research fields" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===
Philosophers of science such as [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that a distinction between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Feyerabend P |date= 1975 |title= Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge |isbn= 978-0-86091-646-8 |chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |chapter= Table of contents and final chapter |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002717/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |archivedate= 2007-12-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|'A particularly radical reinterpretation of science comes from Paul Feyerabend, "the worst enemy of science"... Like Lakatos, Feyerabend was also a student under Popper. In an interview with Feyerabend in ''Science'', [he says] "Equal weight... should be given to competing avenues of knowledge such as astrology, acupunture, and witchcraft..."'&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Among the issues which can make the distinction difficult is variable rates of evolution among the theories and methods of science in response to new data.{{refn|name=fredb|group=Note|"We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and non confirmations."&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Larry Laudan]] has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe our emotions: "If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us".&lt;ref name = "Laudan_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |date=1996 |chapter= The demise of the demarcation problem | veditors = Ruse M | title = But Is It Science?: The Philosophical Question in the Creation/Evolution Controversy |pages= 337–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Richard McNally]] states, "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" and "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= McNally RJ |url= http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |title= Is the pseudoscience concept useful for clinical psychology? |journal= The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |date= 2003 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162007/http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |archivedate= 2010-04-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definition===
For philosophers [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] "pseudo-science may be defined as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate". The definition, in the book ''[[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;54),&lt;ref name="PNS0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Funtowicz S, Ravetz J | year = 1990 | title = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy | location = Dordrecht | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | title-link = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to the loss of craft skills in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of [[post-normal science]]. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assesses uncertainty in quantitative information, such as [[NUSAP]] and – in the case of mathematical modelling – [[sensitivity auditing]].

==History==
{{main article|History of pseudoscience}}
The history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to be properly called such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote = Pseudoscientific – pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific |chapter = Pseudoscientific |chapter-url = |title = Oxford American Dictionary |publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title = The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter = Pseudoscience |ref = harv |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201091026/http://www.skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |archivedate = 2009-02-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the falsification criterion, attributed most notably to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the [[history of science]] and the [[history of pseudoscience]] it can be especially difficult to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this transformation is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins to pseudoscientific or [[Prescientific|pre-scientific]] study of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as astrology and acupuncture, originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greener M | title = Taking on creationism.

A topic, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be termed pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"&gt;{{citation | veditors = Cover JA, Curd M |date= 1998 |title= Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues |pages= 1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 2017-10-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

To demonstrate this point, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: "that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.

In contrast, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].

[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"/&gt; First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is also distinguishable from revelation, theology, or spirituality in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by empirical research and testing.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{Cite magazine |first = Stephen Jay |last = Gould | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |title = Nonoverlapping magisteria |magazine = Natural History |date = March 1997 |issue= 106 |pages= 16–22 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170104061453/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |archive-date= January 4, 2017 |ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sager|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable disputes concern the [[evolution]] of living organisms, the idea of common descent, the geologic history of the Earth, the formation of the solar system, and the origin of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298 |title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design |date= 11 April 2006 |publisher= [[Royal Society]] |location= London, UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040110/http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archive-date=October 13, 2007 |ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as [[Studies on intercessory prayer|the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick]], although they may be based on untestable beliefs, can be tested by the scientific method.

Some statements and common beliefs of popular science may not meet the criteria of science. "Pop" science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve science fiction.&lt;ref name=Pendle&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Pendle | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |title=Popular Science Feature – When Science Fiction is Science Fact |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214144307/http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |archive-date=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to scientific methodology and expert peer review.

If the claims of a given field can be tested experimentally and standards are upheld, it is not pseudoscience, however odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive the claims are. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the method is sound, caution should be used, since science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are "not yet generally accepted". ''[[Protoscience]]'' is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;

===Indicators of the possible presence of pseudoscience===

====Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims====
* Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=211 ''ff''}} (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of a claim with little or no explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt;
* Failure to make use of [[operational definition]]s (i.e. publicly accessible definitions of the variables, terms, or objects of interest so that persons other than the definer can measure or test them independently){{refn|group=Note|'Most terms in theoretical physics, for example, do not enjoy at least some distinct connections with observables, but not of the simple sort that would permit operational ''definitions'' in terms of these observables. [..] If a restriction in favor of operational definitions were to be followed, therefore, most of theoretical ''physics'' would have to be dismissed as meaningless pseudoscience!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Paul Montgomery |last = Churchland | name-list-format = vanc |title = Matter and Consciousness: A Contemporary Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind|year = 1999 |publisher = MIT Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_7CBvggqOE4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22operational+definitions.%22+pseudoscience|page = 90 |ref = harv|isbn = 9780262530743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (See also: [[Reproducibility]]).
* Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (''see'': [[Occam's razor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=269 ff}}, "Parsimony and Efficiency"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[obscurantist]] language, and use of apparently technical jargon in an effort to give claims the superficial trappings of science.
* Lack of boundary conditions: Most well-supported scientific theories possess well-articulated limitations under which the predicted phenomena do and do not apply.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;
* Lack of effective [[Scientific control|controls]], such as [[placebo]] and [[double-blind]], in experimental design.
* Lack of understanding of basic and established principles of physics and engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald E. Simanek |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |title=What is science? What is pseudoscience? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425202814/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |archive-date=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation====
* Assertions that do not allow the logical possibility that they can be shown to be false by observation or physical experiment (''see also'': [[Falsifiability]]).&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lakatos I |date= 1970 |chapter= Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes | veditors = Lakatos I, Musgrave A |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |pages= 91–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=178 ''ff''}} (Deductive Logic, "Fallacies"), and at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific claims that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best "conjectures", or at worst "pseudoscience" (e.g. ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'', esp. section on "Ignoratio elenchi"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must therefore be true, and vice versa (''see'': [[Argument from ignorance]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'' esp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over-reliance on testimonial, [[anecdotal evidence]], or [[personal experience]]: This evidence may be useful for the context of discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation), but should not be used in the context of [[Theory of justification|justification]] (e.g. [[Statistical hypothesis testing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presentation of data that seems to support claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with those claims.&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"/&gt; This is an example of [[selection bias]], a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.
* Promulgating to the status of facts excessive or untested claims that have been previously published elsewhere; an accumulation of such uncritical secondary reports, which do not otherwise contribute their own empirical investigation, is called the [[Woozle effect]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Eileen Gambrill|title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-90438-1|page=109|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Evidence of absence|Reversed burden of proof]]: science places the burden of proof on those making a claim, not on the critic. "Pseudoscientific" arguments may neglect this principle and demand that [[skeptic]]s demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than on the claimant.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;Lilienfeld SO (2004) ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' Guildford Press (2004) {{ISBN|1-59385-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appeals to [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]]: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to dismiss negative findings.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of openness to testing by other experts====
* Evasion of peer review before publicizing results (termed "[[science by press conference]]"):&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gitanjali B | title = Peer review -- process, perspectives and the path ahead | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11832629 | url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/peerReview.pdf | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623193431/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/PeerReview.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|For an opposing perspective, e.g. [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ss5.html Chapter 5 of Suppression Stories by Brian Martin] (Wollongong: Fund for Intellectual Dissent, 1997), pp. 69–83.}} Some proponents of ideas that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forgo the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"/&gt;
* Some agencies, institutions, and publications that fund scientific research require authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share data]] so others can evaluate a paper independently. Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to reproduce the claims contributes to a lack of openness.&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=124 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appealing to the need for secrecy or proprietary knowledge when an [[independent review]] of data or methodology is requested&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"/&gt;
* Substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all viewpoints is not encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absence of progress====
* Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims.&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fredb group=Note/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Terence Hines |last= Hines |first= Terence | name-list-format = vanc |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence |publisher= Prometheus Books |location= Buffalo, NY |date= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-87975-419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Scientific progress]])
* Lack of self-correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to reduce these errors over time.&lt;ref name="Ruscio120"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]], e.g. ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.
* Statistical significance of supporting experimental results does not improve over time and are usually close to the cutoff for statistical significance. Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence. If statistical significance does not improve, this typically shows the experiments have just been repeated until a success occurs due to chance variations.

====Personalization of issues====
* Tight social groups and [[authoritarian personality]], [[suppression of dissent]] and [[groupthink]] can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to confirm their beliefs, the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://archivefreedom.org/ archivefreedom.org], which claims that "The list of suppressed scientists even includes Nobel Laureates!"}}
* Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see [[ad hominem|Ad hominem fallacy]])&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic Argumentum Ad Hominem].}}

====Use of misleading language====
* Creating scientific-sounding terms to persuade nonexperts to believe statements that may be false or meaningless: For example, a long-standing hoax refers to water by the rarely used formal name "[[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]]" and describes it as the main constituent in most [[poison]]ous solutions to show how easily the general public can be misled.
* Using established terms in idiosyncratic ways, thereby demonstrating unfamiliarity with mainstream work in the discipline

==Explanations==
In a report Singer and Benassi (1981) wrote that pseudoscientific beliefs have their origin from at least four sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Barry |last1= Singer |first2= Victor A. |last2= Benassi | name-list-format = vanc |title= Occult beliefs: Media distortions, social uncertainty, and deficiencies of human reasoning seem to be at the basis of occult beliefs |magazine= American Scientist |volume= 69 |issue= 1 |date= January–February 1981 |pages= 49–55 |jstor= 27850247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common cognitive errors from personal experience.
* Erroneous sensationalistic mass media coverage.

* Poor or erroneous science education.

Another American study (Eve and Dunn, 1990) supported the findings of Singer and Benassi and found pseudoscientific belief being promoted by high school life science and biology teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Raymond A. |last1= Eve |first2= Dana |last2= Dunn |name-list-format= vanc |title= Psychic powers, astrology &amp; creationism in the classroom?

===Psychology===
The psychology of pseudoscience attempts to explore and analyze pseudoscientific thinking by means of thorough clarification on making the distinction of what is considered scientific vs. pseudoscientific. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation ([[confirmation bias]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein (1991), humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beyerstein B, Hadaway P | year = 1991 | title = On avoiding folly | url = | journal = Journal of Drug Issues | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 689–700 | doi=10.1177/002204269002000418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]]'s theory of belief-dependent realism is driven by the belief that the brain is essentially a "belief engine," which scans data perceived by the senses and looks for patterns and meaning. There is also the tendency for the brain to create [[cognitive bias]]es, as a result of inferences and assumptions made without logic and based on instinct — usually resulting in patterns in cognition. These tendencies of [[Apophenia|patternicity]] and agenticity are also driven "by a meta-bias called the [[bias blind spot]], or the tendency to recognize the power of cognitive biases in other people but to be blind to their influence on our own beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |authorlink=Michael Shermer |date=July 2011 |title=Understanding the believing brain: Why science is the only way out of belief-dependent realism |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |journal=Scientific American |access-date=14 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830132644/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |archivedate=30 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lindeman states that social motives (i.e., "to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often "more easily" fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lindeman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindeman M | title = Motivation, cognition and pseudoscience | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9883101 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.00085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries with science==
{{Main article|Demarcation problem}}

In the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: "scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Halley's comet#Computation of orbit|return of Halley's comet]] or the [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|gravitational bending of light rays]]&amp;nbsp;– as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'".&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Lakatos offers a "novel [[fallibilist]] analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology" and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of [[Karl Popper]] and Thomas Kuhn.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; "Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper&amp;nbsp;– all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsificationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright... Lakatos sought to reconcile the [[rationalism]] of Popperian falsificationism with what seemed to be its own refutation by history".&lt;ref name="Bird2008"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Bird | chapter = The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science | title = Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science | editor1-first = Stathis | editor1-last = Psillos | editor2-first = Martin | editor2-last = Curd | name-list-format = vanc | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | pages = 9, 14 | chapter-format = pdf | chapter-url = http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | ref = harv | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601030150/http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | archivedate = 2013-06-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}

The boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219–225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&amp;q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but "a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence."&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;

{{quote|To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.&lt;ref name=Newbold&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324–30 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

{{quote|[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. It should be noted that Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.&lt;ref name="Bird2008"/&gt;|Alexander Bird|"The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science" in ''Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science''}}

==Politics, health, and education==

===Political implications===
The demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, [[philosophy]] and [[politics]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; --&gt; Imre Lakatos, for instance, points out that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] at one point declared that [[Mendelian genetics]] was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]], sent to a [[Gulag]] and that the "liberal Establishment of the West" denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos&gt;{{citation |first= Imre |last= Lakatos | name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130745/http://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/2002_LakatosScienceAndPseudoscience128.mp3 |archive-date= 25 July 2011 |format= mp3 |title= Science and Pseudoscience |page= [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728012423/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/about/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscienceTranscript.aspx (archive of transcript)] |nopp= yes |publisher= The London School of Economics and Political Science, Dept of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method |date= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes pseudoscientific when science cannot be separated from [[ideology]], scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite [[politicization of science|distort the facts of science for short-term political gain]], or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Makgoba/&gt; --&gt; These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in [[society]].&lt;ref name=Makgoba&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makgoba MW | title = Politics, the media and science in HIV/AIDS: the peril of pseudoscience | journal = Vaccine | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 1899–904 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11983241 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00063-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and education implications===
Distinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive and dangerous to patients and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.{{refn|group=Note|"From a practical point of view, the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue serious.  For example, creation science may replace evolution in studies of biology."&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"&gt;{{harvp|Hansson|2008|loc= Section 1: The purpose of demarcations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Friedman mentions why most scientists avoid educating about pseudoscience, including that paying undue attention to pseudoscience could dignify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Friedman: "We could dignify pseudoscience by mentioning it at all".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Park emphasizes how pseudoscience can be a threat to society and considers that scientists have a responsibility to teach how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Park: "The more serious threat is to the public, which is not often in a position to judge which claims are real and which are ''voodoo''. ... Those who are fortunate enough to have chosen science as a career have an obligation to ''inform the public about voodoo science''".&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[health]]-related fields, a '''reference range''' or '''reference interval''' is the [[range (statistics)|range]] of values for a [[physiology|physiologic]] measurement in healthy persons (for example, the amount of [[creatinine]] in the [[blood]], or the [[blood gas tension|partial pressure of oxygen]]). It is a basis for comparison (a [[frame of reference]]) for a [[physician]] or other [[health professional]] to interpret a set of test results for a particular patient. Some important reference ranges in medicine are [[reference ranges for blood tests]] and [[Urinalysis#Target parameters|reference ranges for urine tests]].

The standard definition of a reference range (usually referred to if not otherwise specified) originates in what is most prevalent in a [[reference group]] taken from the general (i.e. total) population. This is the general reference range. However, there are also ''optimal health ranges'' (ranges that appear to have the optimal health impact) and ranges for particular conditions or statuses (such as pregnancy reference ranges for hormone levels).

Values '''within the reference range''' ('''WRR''') are those within the [[normal distribution]] and are thus often described as '''within normal limits''' ('''WNL'''). The limits of the normal distribution are called the ''upper reference limit'' (URL) or ''upper limit of normal'' (ULN) and the ''lower reference limit'' (LRL) or ''lower limit of normal'' (LLN). In [[health care]]–related publishing, [[style guide|style sheets]] sometimes prefer the word ''reference'' over the word ''normal'' to prevent the nontechnical [[word sense|senses]] of ''normal'' from being conflated with the statistical sense. Values outside a reference range are not [[wikt:in and of itself#Adverb|necessarily]] pathologic, and they are not necessarily abnormal in any sense other than statistically. Nonetheless, they are indicators of probable pathosis. Sometimes the underlying cause is obvious; in other cases, challenging [[differential diagnosis]] is required to determine what is wrong and thus how to treat it.

A '''cutoff''' or '''threshold''' is a limit used for [[binary classification]], mainly between normal versus pathological (or probably pathological). Establishment methods for cutoffs include using an upper or a lower limit of a reference range.

== Standard definition ==
The standard definition of a reference range for a particular measurement is defined as the interval between which 95% of values of a reference population fall into, in such a way that 2.5% of the time a value will be less than the lower limit of this interval, and 2.5% of the time it will be larger than the upper limit of this interval, whatever the distribution of these values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Je_pJfb2r0cC&amp;pg=PA19 Page 19] in: {{cite book |author=Stephen K. Bangert MA MB BChir MSc MBA FRCPath; William J. Marshall MA MSc MBBS FRCP FRCPath FRCPEdin FIBiol; Marshall, William Leonard |title=Clinical biochemistry: metabolic and clinical aspects |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-443-10186-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference ranges that are given by this definition are sometimes referred as ''standard ranges''.

Regarding the target population, if not otherwise specified, a standard reference range generally denotes the one in healthy individuals, or without any known condition that directly affects the ranges being established. These are likewise established using reference groups from the healthy population, and are sometimes termed ''normal ranges'' or ''normal values'' (and sometimes "usual" ranges/values). However, using the term ''normal'' may not be appropriate as not everyone outside the interval is abnormal, and people who have a particular condition may still fall within this interval.

However, reference ranges may also be established by taking samples from the whole population, with or without diseases and conditions. In some cases, diseased individuals are taken as the population, establishing reference ranges among those having a disease or condition. Preferably, there should be specific reference ranges for each subgroup of the population that has any factor that affects the measurement, such as, for example, specific ranges for each ''sex'', ''age group'', ''race'' or any other [[general determinant]].

===Establishment methods===
Methods for establishing reference ranges are mainly based on assuming a [[normal distribution]] or a [[log-normal distribution]], or directly from percentages of interest, as detailed respectively in following sections.

====Normal distribution====
[[File:Standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|350px|When assuming a normal distribution, the reference range is obtained by measuring the values in a reference group and taking two standard deviations either side of the mean. This encompasses ~95% of the total population.]]

The 95% interval, is often estimated by assuming a [[normal distribution]] of the measured parameter, in which case it can be defined as the interval limited by 1.96&lt;ref name=MedicalStatistics&gt;Page 48 in: {{cite book |author1=Sterne, Jonathan |author2=Kirkwood, Betty R. |title=Essential medical statistics |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-86542-871-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often rounded up to 2) population [[standard deviation]]s from either side of the population mean (also called the [[expected value]]).
However, in the real world, neither the population mean nor the population standard deviation are known. They both need to be estimated from a sample, whose size can be designated ''n''. The population standard deviation is estimated by the sample standard deviation and the population mean is estimated by the sample mean (also called mean or [[arithmetic mean]]). To account for these estimations, the 95% [[prediction interval]] (95% PI) is calculated as:

: {{math|1= 95% PI = mean &amp;plusmn; ''t''{{sub|0.975,''n''&amp;minus;1}}&amp;middot;{{sqrt|(''n''+1)/''n''}}&amp;middot;sd}},

where &lt;math&gt;t_{0.975,n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the 97.5% quantile of a [[Student's t-distribution]] with ''n''&amp;minus;1 [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]].

When the sample size is large (''n''≥30) &lt;math&gt;t_{0.975,n-1}\simeq 2.&lt;/math&gt;

This method is often acceptably accurate if the standard deviation, as compared to the mean, is not very large. A more accurate method is to perform the calculations on logarithmized values, as described in separate section later.

The following example of this (''not'' logarithmized) method is based on values of [[fasting plasma glucose]] taken from a reference group of 12 subjects:&lt;ref name=Keevil1998&gt;[http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content-nw/full/44/7/1535/T1 Table 1.

    \sqrt{0.18 } = 0.42 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;= '''standard deviation (s.d.)'''
|}

As can be given from, for example, a [[Student's t-distribution#Table of selected values|table of selected values of Student's t-distribution]], the 97.5% percentile with (12-1) degrees of freedom corresponds to 
&lt;math&gt;t_{0.975,11} = 2.20&lt;/math&gt;
 
Subsequently, the lower and upper limits of the standard reference range are calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; Lower~limit = m - t_{0.975,11} \times\sqrt{\frac{n+1}{n}}\times s.d. = 5.33 - 2.20\times\sqrt{\frac{13}{12}} \times 0.42 = 4.4&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Upper~limit = m + t_{0.975,11} \times\sqrt{\frac{n+1}{n}}\times s.d. = 5.33 + 2.20\times\sqrt{\frac{13}{12}} \times 0.42 = 6.3.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the standard reference range for this example is estimated to be 4.4 to 6.3&amp;nbsp;mmol/L.

=====Confidence interval of limit=====
The 90% ''confidence interval of a standard reference range limit'' as estimated assuming a normal distribution can be calculated by:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7XwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 Page 65] in: {{cite book|title=Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics|author=Carl A. Burtis, David E. Bruns|edition=7|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2014|isbn=9780323292061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Lower limit of the confidence interval = percentile limit - 2.81 &amp;times; {{frac|''SD''|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}

: Upper limit of the confidence interval = percentile limit + 2.81 &amp;times; {{frac|''SD''|{{sqrt|''n''}}}},

where SD is the standard deviation, and n is the number of samples.

Taking the example from the previous section, the number of samples is 12 and the standard deviation is 0.42&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, resulting in:

:''Lower limit of the confidence interval'' of the ''lower limit of the standard reference range'' = 4.4 - 2.81 &amp;times; {{frac|0.42|{{sqrt|12}}}} &amp;asymp; 4.1

:''Upper limit of the confidence interval'' of the ''lower limit of the standard reference range'' = 4.4 + 2.81  &amp;times; {{frac|0.42|{{sqrt|12}}}} &amp;asymp; 4.7

Thus, the lower limit of the reference range can be written as 4.4 (90% CI 4.1-4.7) mmol/L.

Likewise, with similar calculations, the upper limit of the reference range can be written as 6.3 (90% CI 6.0-6.6) mmol/L.

These confidence intervals reflect [[random error]], but do not compensate for [[systematic error]], which in this case can arise from, for example, the reference group not having fasted long enough before blood sampling.

As a comparison, actual reference ranges used clinically for fasting plasma glucose are estimated to have a lower limit of approximately 3.8&lt;ref name=firstaid&gt;Last page of {{cite book |author1=Deepak A. Rao |author2=Le, Tao |author3=Bhushan, Vikas |title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2008 (First Aid for the Usmle Step 1) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-07-149868-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 4.0,&lt;ref name=uppsala&gt;Reference range list from Uppsala University Hospital ("Laborationslista"). Artnr 40284 Sj74a. Issued on April 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and an upper limit of approximately 6.0&lt;ref name=uppsala/&gt; to 6.1.&lt;ref name=Medline-GTT&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003466|Glucose tolerance test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Log-normal distribution====
[[Image:PDF-log normal distributions.svg|thumb|Some functions of [[log normal distribution]] (here shown with the measurements non-logarithmized), with the same means - ''μ'' (as calculated after logarithmizing) but different standard deviations - ''σ'' (after logarithmizing).]]
In reality, biological parameters tend to have a [[log-normal distribution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Huxley | first = Julian S.  | year = 1932  | title = Problems of relative growth  | publisher = London  | oclc = 476909537  | ref = harv  | isbn = 0-486-61114-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the arithmetical normal distribution (which is generally referred to as normal distribution without any further specification).

An explanation for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half the value of the mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of [[negative number]]s (at least when measured on [[absolute scale]]s), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive [[skewness]].

As shown in diagram at right, this phenomenon has relatively small effect if the standard deviation (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to an arithmetical normal distribution. Thus, the arithmetical normal distribution may be more appropriate to use with small standard deviations for convenience, and the log-normal distribution with large standard deviations.

In a log-normal distribution, the [[geometric standard deviation]]s and [[geometric mean]] more accurately estimate the 95% prediction interval than their arithmetic counterparts.

=====Necessity=====
The necessity to establish a reference range by log-normal distribution rather than arithmetic normal distribution can be regarded as depending on how much difference it would make to ''not'' do so, which can be described as the  ratio:

:{{math|1=Difference ratio = {{sfrac| {{mabs| Limit{{sub|log-normal}} - Limit{{sub|normal}} }} | Limit{{sub|log-normal}} }} }}

where:
*''Limit&lt;sub&gt;log-normal&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the (lower or upper) limit as estimated by assuming log-normal distribution
*''Limit&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the (lower or upper) limit as estimated by assuming arithmetically normal distribution.

This difference can be put solely in relation to the [[coefficient of variation]], as in the diagram at right, where:

:{{math|1=Coefficient of variation = {{sfrac|s.d.|m}}}}

where:
*''s.d.'' is the arithmetic standard deviation
*''m'' is the arithmetic mean

In practice, it can be regarded as necessary to use the establishment methods of a log-normal distribution if the difference ratio becomes more than 0.1, meaning that a (lower or upper) limit estimated from an assumed arithmetically normal distribution would be more than 10% different from the corresponding limit as estimated from a (more accurate) log-normal distribution. As seen in the diagram, a difference ratio of 0.1 is reached for the lower limit at a coefficient of variation of 0.213 (or 21.3%), and for the upper limit at a coefficient of variation at 0.413 (41.3%). The lower limit is more affected by increasing coefficient of variation, and its "critical" coefficient of variation of 0.213 corresponds to a ratio of (upper limit)/(lower limit) of 2.43, so as a rule of thumb, if the upper limit is more than 2.4 times the lower limit when estimated by assuming arithmetically normal distribution, then it should be considered to do the calculations again by log-normal distribution.

Taking the example from previous section, the arithmetic standard deviation (s.d.) is estimated at 0.42 and the arithmetic mean (m) is estimated at 5.33. Thus the coefficient of variation is 0.079. This is less than both 0.213 and 0.413, and thus both the lower and upper limit of fasting blood glucose can most likely be estimated by assuming arithmetically normal distribution. More specifically, the coefficient of variation of 0.079 corresponds to a difference ratio of 0.01 (1%) for the lower limit and 0.007 (0.7%) for the upper limit.

=====From logarithmized sample values=====
A method to estimate the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary [[base of a logarithm|base]] (for example [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]), derive the mean and standard deviation of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above that mean, and subsequently [[exponentiation|exponentiate]] using those two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.

The following example of this method is based on the same values of [[fasting plasma glucose]] as used in the previous section, using [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] as a [[base of a logarithm|base]]:&lt;ref name=Keevil1998/&gt;

|}

Subsequently, the still logarithmized lower limit of the reference range is calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \ln (\text{lower limit}) &amp;= \mu_{\log} - t_{0.975,n-1} \times\sqrt{\frac{n+1}{n}} \times \sigma_{\log}\\ 
&amp;= 1.67 - 2.20\times\sqrt{\frac{13}{12}} \times 0.079 = 1.49, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the upper limit of the reference range as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \ln (\text{upper limit}) &amp;= \mu_{\log} + t_{0.975,n-1} \times\sqrt{\frac{n+1}{n}} \times \sigma_{\log}\\ 
&amp;= 1.67 + 2.20\times\sqrt{\frac{13}{12}} \times 0.079 = 1.85 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Conversion back to non-logarithmized values are subsequently performed as:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Lower limit} = e^{\ln (\text{lower limit})} = e^{1.49} = 4.4&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Upper limit} = e^{\ln (\text{upper limit})} = e^{1.85} = 6.4&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the standard reference range for this example is estimated to be 4.4 to 6.4.

=====From arithmetic mean and variance=====
An alternative method of establishing a reference range with the assumption of log-normal distribution is to use the arithmetic mean and arithmetic value of standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful for example in cases where a study that establishes a reference range presents only the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of arithmetically normal distribution is shown to be less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic mean and standard deviation may be the only available parameters to correct the reference range.

By assuming that the [[expected value]] can represent the arithmetic mean in this case, the parameters ''μ&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''σ&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be estimated from the arithmetic mean (''m'') and standard deviation (''s.d.'') as:
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\log} = \ln(m) - \frac12 \ln\!\left(1 + \!\left(\frac\text{s.d.}{m}\right)^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{\log} = \sqrt{\ln\!\left(1 + \!\left(\frac\text{s.d.}{m}\right)^2 \right)} &lt;/math&gt;

Following the exampled reference group from the previous section:

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\log} = \ln(5.33) - \frac12 \ln\!\left(1 + \!\left(\frac{0.42}{5.33}\right)^2 \right) = 1.67&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{\log} = \sqrt{\ln\!\left(1 + \!\left(\frac{0.42}{5.33}\right)^2 \right)} = 0.079 &lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, the logarithmized, and later non-logarithmized, lower and upper limit are calculated just as by logarithmized sample values.

====Directly from percentages of interest====
Reference ranges can also be established directly from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the measurements in the reference group. For example, if the reference group consists of 200 people, and counting from the measurement with lowest value to highest, the lower limit of the reference range would correspond to the 5th measurement and the upper limit would correspond to the 195th measurement.

This method can be used even when measurement values do not appear to conform conveniently to any form of normal distribution or other function.

However, the reference range limits as estimated in this way have higher variance, and therefore less reliability, than those estimated by an arithmetic or log-normal distribution (when such is applicable), because the latter ones acquire [[statistical power]] from the measurements of the whole reference group rather than just the measurements at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Still, this variance decreases with increasing size of the reference group, and therefore, this method may be optimal where a large reference group easily can be gathered, and the distribution mode of the measurements is uncertain.

====Bimodal distribution====
[[Image:bimodal.png|thumb|300px|[[Bimodal distribution]]]]
In case of a [[bimodal distribution]] (seen at right), it is useful to find out why this is the case. Two reference ranges can be established for the two different groups of people, making it possible to assume a normal distribution for each group. This bimodal pattern is commonly seen in tests that differ between men and women, such as [[prostate specific antigen]].

===Interpretation of standard ranges in medical tests===
In case of [[medical test]]s whose results are of continuous values, reference ranges can be used in the interpretation of an individual test result. This is primarily used for [[diagnostic test]]s and [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] tests, while [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring test]]s may optimally be interpreted from previous tests of the same individual instead.

====Probability of random variability====
Reference ranges aid in the evaluation of whether a test result's deviation from the mean is a result of random variability or a result of an underlying disease or condition. If the reference group used to establish the reference range can be assumed to be representative of the individual person in a healthy state, then a test result from that individual that turns out to be lower or higher than the reference range can be interpreted as that there is less than 2.5% probability that this would have occurred by random variability in the absence of disease or other condition, which, in turn, is strongly indicative for considering an underlying disease or condition as a cause.

Such further consideration can be performed, for example, by an [[Differential diagnosis#Specific methods|epidemiology-based differential diagnostic procedure]], where potential candidate conditions are listed that may explain the finding, followed by calculations of how probable they are to have occurred in the first place, in turn followed by a comparison with the probability that the result would have occurred by random variability.

If the establishment of the reference range could have been made assuming a normal distribution, then the probability that the result would be an effect of random variability can be further specified as follows:

The [[standard deviation]], if not given already, can be inversely calculated by the fact that the [[absolute value]] of the difference between the mean and either the upper or lower limit of the reference range is approximately 2 standard deviations (more accurately 1.96), and thus:

:{{math|Standard deviation (s.d.) &amp;asymp; {{sfrac|{{mabs | (Mean) - (Upper limit) }} |2}}}}.

The [[standard score]] for the individual's test can subsequently be calculated as:

:{{math|1= Standard score (''z'') = {{sfrac|{{mabs | (Mean) - (individual measurement) }} |s.d.}}}}.

The probability that a value is of a certain distance from the mean can subsequently be calculated from the [[Standard score#prediction intervals|relation between standard score and prediction intervals]]. For example, a standard score of 2.58 corresponds to a prediction interval of 99%,&lt;ref name=Kirkup2002&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rDsec-JnCAwC&amp;pg=PA111 Page 111] in: {{cite book |author=Kirkup, Les |title=Data analysis with Excel: an introduction for physical scientists |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-521-79737-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to a probability of 0.5% that a result is at least such far from the mean in the absence of disease.

====Example====
{{Hatnote|Method is described in further detail in [[Differential diagnosis]]}}
Let's say, for example, that an individual takes a test that measures the [[ionized calcium]] in the blood, resulting in a value of 1.30&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, and a reference group that appropriately represents the individual has established a reference range of 1.05 to 1.25&amp;nbsp;mmol/L. The individual's value is higher than the upper limit of the reference range, and therefore has less than 2.5% probability of being a result of random variability, constituting a strong indication to make a [[differential diagnosis]] of possible causative conditions.

In this case, an [[Differential diagnosis#Specific methods|epidemiology-based differential diagnostic procedure]] is used, and its first step is to find candidate conditions that can explain the finding.

[[Hypercalcemia]] (usually defined as a calcium level above the reference range) is mostly caused by either [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] or malignancy,&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;Table 20-4 in: {{cite book |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, it is reasonable to include these in the differential diagnosis.

Using for example epidemiology and the individual's risk factors, let's say that the probability that the hypercalcemia would have been caused by primary hyperparathyroidism in the first place is estimated to be 0.00125 (or 0.125%), the equivalent probability for cancer is 0.0002, and 0.0005 for other conditions. With a probability given as less than 0.025 of no disease, this corresponds to a probability that the hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place of up to 0.02695. However, the hypercalcemia ''has occurred'' with a probability of 100%, resulting adjusted probabilities of at least 4.6% that primary hyperparathyroidism has caused the hypercalcemia, at least 0.7% for cancer, at least 1.9% for other conditions and up to 92.8% for that there is no disease and the hypercalcemia is caused by random variability.

In this case, further processing benefits from specification of the probability of random variability:

The value is assumed to conform acceptably to a normal distribution, so the mean can be assumed to be 1.15 in the reference group. The [[standard deviation]], if not given already, can be inversely calculated by knowing that the [[absolute value]] of the difference between the mean and, for example, the upper limit of the reference range, is approximately 2 standard deviations (more accurately 1.96), and thus:
:{{math|1=Standard deviation (s.d.) &amp;asymp; {{sfrac|{{mabs | (Mean) - (Upper limit) }} |2}} = {{sfrac|{{mabs | 1.15 - 1.25 }}|2}} = {{sfrac| 0.1 |2}} = 0.05}}.

The [[standard score]] for the individual's test is subsequently calculated as:
:{{math|1= Standard score (''z'') = {{sfrac|{{mabs | (Mean) - (individual measurement) }} |s.d.}} = {{sfrac|{{mabs | 1.15 - 1.30 }}|0.05}} = {{sfrac|0.15|0.05}} = 3}}.

The probability that a value is of so much larger value than the mean as having a standard score of 3 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.14% (given by {{math|(100% &amp;minus; 99.7%)/2}}, with 99.7% here being given from the [[68-95-99.7 rule]]).

Using the same probabilities that the hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place by the other candidate conditions, the probability that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place is 0.00335, and given the fact that hypercalcemia ''has occurred'' gives adjusted probabilities of 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, for primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions and no disease.

==Optimal health range==
''Optimal (health) range'' or ''therapeutic target'' (not to be confused with [[biological target]]) is a reference range or limit that is based on concentrations or levels that are associated with optimal health or minimal risk of related complications and diseases, rather than the standard range based on normal distribution in the population.

It may be more appropriate to use for e.g. [[folate]], since approximately 90 percent of North Americans may actually suffer more or less from [[folate deficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhealthbase.com/folic_acid.htm Folic Acid: Don't Be Without It!] by Hans R. Larsen, MSc ChE, retrieved on July 7, 2009. In turn citing: 
*{{cite journal | author = Boushey Carol J. | year = 1995 | title = A quantitative assessment of plasma homocysteine as a risk factor for vascular disease | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 1049–57 | doi=10.1001/jama.274.13.1049|display-authors=etal}}
*{{cite journal | author = Morrison Howard I. | year = 1996 | title = Serum folate and risk of fatal coronary heart disease | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 275 | issue = | pages = 1893–96 | doi=10.1001/jama.1996.03530480035037|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the standard reference range. In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the standard reference ranges. [[Vitamin D]] has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. [[uric acid]], having a level not exceeding the standard reference range still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most [[toxin]]s, the standard reference range is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.

A problem with optimal health range is a lack of a standard method of estimating the ranges. The limits may be defined as those where the health risks exceed a certain threshold, but with various risk profiles between different measurements (such as folate and vitamin D), and even different risk aspects for one and the same measurement (such as both [[Vitamin A deficiency|deficiency]] and [[Hypervitaminosis A|toxicity of vitamin A]]) it is difficult to standardize. Subsequently, optimal health ranges, when given by various sources, have an additional [[Statistical variability|variability]] caused by various definitions of the parameter. Also, as with standard reference ranges, there should be specific ranges for different determinants that affects the values, such as sex, age etc. Ideally, there should rather be an estimation of what is the optimal value for every individual, when taking all significant factors of that individual into account - a task that may be hard to achieve by studies, but long clinical experience by a physician may make this method more preferable than using reference ranges.
{{anchor|cutoff}}

==One-sided cut-off values==
In many cases, only one side of the range is usually of interest, such as with markers of pathology including [[cancer antigen 19-9]], where it is generally without any clinical significance to have a value below what is usual in the population. Therefore, such targets are often given with only one limit of the reference range given, and, strictly, such values are rather ''cut-off values'' or ''threshold values''.

They may represent both standard ranges and optimal health ranges. Also, they may represent an appropriate value to distinguish healthy person from a specific disease, although this gives additional variability by different diseases being distinguished. For example, for [[NT-proBNP]], a lower cut-off value is used in distinguishing healthy babies from those with [[acyanotic heart disease]], compared to the cut-off value used in distinguishing healthy babies from those with [[congenital nonspherocytic anemia]].&lt;ref name=Moses2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735842_3 Screening for Congenital Heart Disease with NT-proBNP: Results] By Emmanuel Jairaj Moses, Sharifah A.I. Mokhtar, Amir Hamzah, Basir Selvam Abdullah, and Narazah Mohd Yusoff. Laboratory Medicine. 2011;42(2):75-80. © 2011 American Society for Clinical Pathology&lt;/ref&gt;

==General drawbacks==
For standard as well as optimal health ranges, and cut-offs, sources of [[Accuracy and precision|inaccuracy and imprecision]] include:

*Instruments and lab techniques used, or how the measurements are interpreted by observers. These may apply both to the instruments etc. used to establish the reference ranges and the instruments, etc. used to acquire the value for the individual to whom these ranges is applied. To compensate, individual laboratories should have their own lab ranges to account for the instruments used in the laboratory.
*[[Risk factor#General determinants|Determinants]] such as age, diet, etc. that are not compensated for. Optimally, there should be reference ranges from a reference group that is as similar as possible to each individual they are applied to, but it's practically impossible to compensate for every single determinant, often not even when the reference ranges are established from multiple measurements of the same individual they are applied to, because of [[test-retest reliability|test-retest]] variability.

Also, reference ranges tend to give the impression of definite thresholds that clearly separate "good" or "bad" values, while in reality there are generally continuously increasing risks with increased distance from usual or optimal values.

With this and uncompensated factors in mind, the ideal interpretation method of a test result would rather consist of a comparison of what would be expected or optimal in the individual when taking all factors and conditions of that individual into account, rather than strictly classifying the values as "good" or "bad" by using reference ranges from other people.

In a recent paper, Rappoport et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Rappoport|first=Nadav|last2=Paik|first2=Hyojung|last3=Oskotsky|first3=Boris|last4=Tor|first4=Ruth|last5=Ziv|first5=Elad|last6=Zaitlen|first6=Noah|last7=Butte|first7=Atul J.|date=2017-11-04|title=Creating ethnicity-specific reference intervals for lab tests from EHR data|biorxiv=213892}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a novel way to redefine reference range from an [[Electronic health record]] system. In such a system, a higher population resolution can be achieved (e.g., age, sex, race and ethnicity-specific).

==Clinical research==
In clinical research a research site conducts all or part of a [[clinical trial]]. For clinical trials which recruit [[research participants]] in multiple locations, often the research will have a [[headquarters]] then multiple regional research sites to conduct the research in that region. In a network of research sites where all are recruiting study participants, sites with low recruitment benefit from coaching from sites with high recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=MR |last2=Kenworthy-Heinige |first2=T |last3=Beck |first3=DJ |last4=Asghar |first4=A |last5=Broussard |first5=EB |last6=Bratcher |first6=K |last7=Tommessilli |first7=LM |last8=Antonelli |first8=M |last9=Planeta |first9=BM |title=Research site mentoring: A novel approach to improving study recruitment. |journal=Contemporary clinical trials communications |date=March 2018 |volume=9 |pages=172-177 |doi=10.1016/j.conctc.2018.01.011 |pmid=29696240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of good clinical research sites include setting good timelines, early participant recruitment, and having a management plan for efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baer |first1=AR |last2=Bridges |first2=KD |last3=O'Dwyer |first3=M |last4=Ostroff |first4=J |last5=Yasko |first5=J |title=Clinical research site infrastructure and efficiency. |journal=Journal of oncology practice |date=September 2010 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=249-52 |doi=10.1200/JOP.000109 |pmid=21197190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

'''''Science, Order, and Creativity''''' is a [[book]] by theoretical physicist [[David Bohm]] and physicist and writer [[F. David Peat]]. It was originally published 1987 by [[Bantam Books]], USA, then 1989 in Great Britain by [[Routledge]]. The second edition, published in 2000 after Bohm`s death, comprises a new foreword by Peat as well as an additional introductory chapter, in which a fictitious dialogue between Bohm and Peat serves to introduce the reader to the context and topics of the book.

In ''Science, Order and Creativity'', the authors emphasize the role of creativity and communication for science and, also beyond science, for humanity as a whole.

== Contents by Chapter ==
;''1 Revolutions, Theories, and Creativity in Science'': The authors consider the form of creativity that is constituted by a [[metaphor]] and by equating two different kinds of things, based on an act of perception of a similarity. They emphasize the role of communication and art as part of creativity, citing the example of [[Helen Keller]] who, through communication with her mentor [[Anne Sullivan]] was led to understanding a similarity among the sensations of water and the symbolic gesture pressed into her palm which represented it.

;''2 Science as Creative Perception–Communication'': The authors build upon the aspect of communication by discussing science as a social activity and the role of language in science, discussing in particular also the examples of the various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], including the objections raised against the [[causal interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. They point out that its mathematical basis is open to a range of modifications which extend "beyond current quantum theory", for instance concerning the role of trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;The authors cite D. Bohm and [[J. P. Vigier]], ''Physical Review'', vol.&amp;nbsp;96, no.&amp;nbsp;208 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

;''3 What is Order?'': The notion is introduced that all processes take place in an ''[[:wikt:order|order]]'', with the particular order depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;''Science, Order and Creativity'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguish orders of first, second and higher degrees, and interpret [[randomness]] as an order of infinite degree. At the same time, the degree itself depends on the context, and on what is known and taken into consideration concerning the underlying processes. Bohm and Peat further propose to a spectrum of order, with causal laws and statistical laws representing limiting cases of a more general range of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Science, Order and Creativity'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

;''4 The Generate Order and the Implicate Order'': This chapter introduces the notions of generative order and [[implicate order]], citing examples from, among others, mathematics ([[fractal]] order as proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]],&lt;ref&gt;The authors cite ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature'', Freeman, New York, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fourier series]], and touching upon [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s notion of an [[Metamorphosis of Plants|''Urpflanze'' and the morphology of plants]]&lt;ref&gt;The authors cite Ronald H. Brady, ''The Causal Dimension of Goethe's morphology'', in Amrine, Zucker, and Wheeler, eds., ''Goethe and the Sciences: A Reconsideration'', Reidel, Dordrecht, Holland, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;) art (from schemata&lt;ref&gt;For schemata, the authors cite [[Ernst Gombrich|Ernest H. Gombrich]]: ''Art and Illusion'', Bollingen Series, Prineton University Press, Princeton, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; changing from [[Renaissance painting]] to the vortex-like order of [[J. M. W. Turner]] to the use of light by [[Claude Monet]] and the exploration of composition and structure by [[Paul Cézanne]]), science (holography, the [[Green's function]] and its relation to [[Feynman diagram]]s and the [[Huygens principle]], as well as Bohm's [[implicit order]], ''superimplicate order'' and [[holomovement]] in an infinite extension). The implicate and generative orders are emphasized as ground for all [[experience]], accessible to direct experience by perception of well-defined forms, for instance the [[reverberation]] of earlier notes of music, or the viewing of a scene of a film as a whole, or various resonances of words and images in poetry. Explicate orders, in contrast, are emphasized by society in so far as they are considered absolutely necessary for its survival, and suitable for large-scale organization and technology.

;''5 Generative Order in Science, Society, and Consciousness'': These considerations are carried further, citing among others the works of [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Brian Goodwin]] and [[Rupert Sheldrake]] towards a generative order that lies beyond both [[Lamarckism]] and [[Darwinism]]. This chapter further provides a view of the role of human [[creativity]], when attention is allowed to move freely, for putting forth "new sensory orders and structures that form into new perceptions".

;''6 Creativity in the Whole of Life'': The individual, cosmic and social dimensions are considered. It is held that creativity blockages can be overcome and that " ‘loosening’ rigidly held intellectual content in the tacit infrastructure of consciousness"  plays a main role for awakening creative intelligence.

;''7 The Order Between and Beyond'': Examples of the development of various orders are provided. To solve problems faced by society, there is need to find not merely "orders in between" (as a form of compromise between other orders) but rather to creatively extend to richer "orders beyond" which encompass different orders together in another form. As one of the examples for a search for "an order beyond", the authors cite the work of Bohm and his colleague [[Basil Hiley]] towards finding an underlying ''[[Basil Hiley#Implicate orders, pre-space and algebraic structures|pre-space]]'' which would allow the incompatibilities of quantum theory and relativity to be addressed. The authors emphasize that creativity, including the search for "orders beyond", contributes to make it possible to "move towards a new consciousness".

The '''Science.ie''' portal provides all sorts of information about careers in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM).

== Overview ==

Science.ie is an initiative of the Irish Government’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme in [[Ireland]].  DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].

The careers-related information on Science.ie has been moved to a new DSE website - [http://www.mysciencecareer.ie My Science Career] - which was launched in early October 2009. On MyScienceCareer.ie is:

*Profiles of people currently working in STEM in [[Ireland]] 
*Information on famous Irish scientists 
*Links to many other career resources

A redeveloped Science.ie was also launched in October 2009. The site has been redesigned and includes social media bookmarking and RSS feeds.

Science.ie provides more general information on science in [[Ireland]]. This includes listings of science links, news and events. Its "Resources" section gives information on activities and visitor centres where you can learn about [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2000/1212/00121200185.html Received "Site of the Week" from The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/going-to-college-75789.html Science.ie featured in the Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also provides a free newsletter relating to Irish science, technology and innovation news, events, research and facts which is issued monthly by email.

In November 2009 Science.ie launched a Twitter channel. [https://twitter.com/irelandscience Follow Science.ie on Twitter.]

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[My Science Career]], [[Project Blogger]], [[Science Week Ireland]] and [[Discover Primary Science]].

A 2016 study found evidence that Wikipedia increases the distribution and impact of [[open access]] science publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teplitskiy|first1=Misha|last2=Lu|first2=Grace|last3=Duede|first3=Eamon|title=Amplifying the impact of open access: Wikipedia and the diffusion of science|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=September 2017|volume=68|issue=9|pages=2116–2127|doi=10.1002/asi.23687|arxiv=1506.07608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] reports that Wikipedia is a popular source of science information because Wikipedia has high ranking in [[search engines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Natural Sciences Sector|title=The UNESCO Science Report finds a new public on Wikipedia|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/single-view-sc-policy/news/the_unesco_science_report_finds_a_new_public_on_wikipedia/|website=[[UNESCO]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=en|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examined the way that Wikipedia integrates new scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benjakob |first1=Omer |last2=Aviram |first2=Rona |title=A Clockwork Wikipedia: From a Broad Perspective to a Case Study |journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms |date=17 April 2018 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=233–244 |doi=10.1177/0748730418768120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
In 2016 the [[Wiki Education Foundation]] and the [[Simons Foundation]] presented an outreach program called the "Year of Science". In this program, Wikipedia educators visited academic conferences and invited scientists to contribute information from their field of expertise to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Simons Foundation]]|title=Mind the Gaps: Improving the Science on Wikipedia|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2017/03/01/mind-the-gaps-improving-the-science-on-wikipedia/|website=Simons Foundation|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities have programs to encourage students to edit Wikipedia's science articles as part of the learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Meghan|title=Science Students Are Writing Wikipedia Articles Instead of Term Papers|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjbbw/science-students-are-writing-wikipedia-articles-instead-of-term-papers|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wikipedia community invites academics to edit Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafee|first1=Thomas|last2=Mietchen|first2=Daniel|last3=Su|first3=Andrew I.|title=Academics can help shape Wikipedia|journal=Science|date=11 August 2017|volume=357|issue=6351|pages=557.2–558|doi=10.1126/science.aao0462|bibcode=2017Sci...357..557S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic societies have encouraged their membership to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Evan B.|title=Three Reasons Why Earth Scientists Should Edit Wikipedia|url=https://eos.org/opinions/three-reasons-why-earth-scientists-should-edit-wikipedia|website=Eos|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
A 2005 study published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' compared 40 Wikipedia articles on science topics to their ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' counterpart. Subject experts found four "serious errors" in each encyclopedia. They also found 162 less serious problems in Wikipedia, and 123 in ''Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/study-wikipedia-as-accurate-as-britannica/|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|work=CNET|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[popular science]] writer for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' complained in 2017 that Wikipedia's science articles were too technical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Michael|title=Wikipedia’s Science Articles Are Elitist|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne7xzq/wikipedias-science-articles-are-elitist|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists and media organizations have questioned and critiqued the extent to which Wikipedia articles on science influence political decisions relating to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucassen|first=Teun|last2=Dijkstra|first2=Roald|last3=Schraagen|first3=Jan Maarten|date=2012-08-20|title=Readability of Wikipedia|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3916|journal=First Monday|language=en|volume=0|issue=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Liat|title=Wikipedia wars are harming politically charged science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wikipedia-wars-are-killing-politically-charged-science|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Nathan|title=The Political Controversy of Wikipedia Science Articles|url=https://psmag.com/environment/according-to-wikipedia-acid-rain-is-a-load-of-bullshit|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">'''Scientific teaching''' is a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach used in undergraduate science classrooms whereby teaching and learning is approached with the same rigor as science itself. 

According to a 2004 Policy Forum in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine, "scientific teaching involves active learning strategies to engage students in the process of science and teaching methods that have been systematically tested and shown to reach diverse students."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Diane Ebert-May, Robert Beichner, Peter Bruns, Amy Chang, Robert DeHaan, Jim Gentile, Sarah Lauffer, James Stewart, Shirley M. Tilghman, and William B. Wood. (2004). "[http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/documents/ScientificTeaching.pdf Scientific Teaching]." Science 304(5670, 23 April), 521-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 volume ''Scientific Teaching''&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund.  (2007). [http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/books.htm ''Scientific Teaching''].  Madison, WI; Englewood, CO; and New York: The Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, Roberts &amp; Company, and W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  lists three major tenets of scientific teaching:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''Active learning''': A process in which students are actively engaged in learning.  It may include inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning, or student-centered learning.
*'''Assessment''': Tools for measuring progress toward and achievement of the learning goals.
*'''Diversity''':  The breadth of differences that make each student unique, each cohort of students unique, and each teaching experience unique.  Diversity includes everything in the classroom: the students, the instructors, the content, the teaching methods, and the context.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These elements should underlie educational and pedagogical decisions in the classroom. The "[[SCALE-UP]]" learning environment is an example of applying the scientific teaching approach.  In practice, scientific teaching employs a "backward design" approach.  The instructor first decides what the students should know and be able to do (learning goals), then determines what would be evidence of student achievement of the learning goals, then designs assessments to measure this achievement.  Finally, the instructor plans the learning activities, which should facilitate student learning through scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ebert-May and J. Hodder.

'''Skepticism''' ([[American English]]) or '''scepticism''' ([[British English]], [[Australian English]], and Canadian English) is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of putative knowledge or belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. H. |last=Popkin |title=The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B. Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism (1984) |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Skeptikoi |work=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted." [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm utm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often directed at domains, such as the [[supernatural]], morality ([[moral skepticism]]), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ozv0lftrUeEC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|year = 2008|isbn = 9780195183214|language = en|first = John|last = Greco|authorlink=John Greco (philosopher)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly [[epistemology]], although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience.

[[Philosophical skepticism]] comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the "big questions" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. [[Religious skepticism]] is "doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of SKEPTICISM|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific skepticism]] concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] investigation using the [[scientific method]], to discover [[empirical evidence]] for them.

==Definition==
In ordinary usage, skepticism (US) or scepticism (UK) ([[Ancient Greek|Greek:]] 'σκέπτομαι' ''skeptomai'', to search, to think about or look for; see also [[Draught and draft|spelling differences]]) can refer to:

# an attitude of doubt or a disposition to incredulity either in general or toward a particular object;
# the [[doctrine]] that true [[knowledge]] or some particular knowledge is uncertain;
# the method of suspended judgment, systematic doubt, or criticism that is characteristic of skeptics (Merriam–Webster).

In [[philosophy]], skepticism can refer to:
# a mode of inquiry that emphasizes critical scrutiny, caution, and intellectual rigor;
# a method of obtaining knowledge through systematic doubt and continual testing;
# a set of claims about the limitations of human knowledge and the proper response to such limitations.

==Philosophical skepticism==
{{Main|Philosophical skepticism}}
As a philosophical school or movement, skepticism originated in ancient Greece. A number of Greek [[Sophists]] held skeptical views. [[Gorgias]], for example, reputedly argued that nothing exists, that even if there were something we couldn’t know it, and that even if we could know it we could not communicate it.&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Jones, ''A History of Western Philosophy''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1952, p. 60 n. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Sophist, [[Cratylus]], refused to discuss anything and would merely wriggle his finger, claiming that communication is impossible since meanings are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Popkin, "Skepticism," in Paul Edwards, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 7. New York: Macmillan, 1967, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sophists’ leading critic, [[Socrates]], also had skeptical tendencies, claiming that he knew nothing, or at least nothing worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Hazlett, ''A Critical Introduction to Skepticism''. London: Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two major schools of skepticism in the ancient Greek and Roman world. One was [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]], which was founded by [[Pyrrho of Elis]] (c. 360–270 BCE). The other was [[Academic skepticism]], so-called because its two leading defenders, [[Arcesilaus]] (c. 315–240 BCE) and [[Carneades]] (c. 217–128 BCE) were Heads of Plato’s [[Academy]]. Both schools of skepticism denied that knowledge is possible and urged suspension of judgment (''epoche'') for the sake of mental tranquility (''ataraxia''). The major difference between the schools seems to have been that Academic skeptics claimed that some beliefs are more reasonable or probable than others, whereas Pyrrhonian skeptics argued that equally compelling arguments can be given for or against any disputed view.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, "Skepticism" p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the writings of the ancient skeptics are now lost. Most of what we know about ancient skepticism is due to [[Sextus Empiricus]], a Pyrrhonian skeptic who lived in the second or third century A.D. His major work, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', contains a lucid summary of stock skeptical arguments.

Ancient skepticism faded out during the late Roman Empire, particularly after [[Augustine]] (354–430 CE) attacked the skeptics in his work ''Against the Academics'' (386 CE). There was little knowledge of, or interest in, ancient skepticism in Christian Europe during the Middle Ages. Interest revived during the Renaissance and Reformation, particularly after the complete writings of Sextus Empiricus were translated into Latin in 1569. A number of Catholic writers, including [[Francisco Sanches]] (c. 1550–1623), [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592), [[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592–1655), and [[Marin Mersenne]] (1588–1648) deployed ancient skeptical arguments to defend moderate forms of skepticism and to argue that faith, rather than reason, must be the primary guide to truth. Similar arguments were offered later (perhaps ironically) by the Protestant thinker [[Pierre Bayle]] in his influential Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697–1702).&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Popkin, ''The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza'', rev. ed. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979, chaps 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of skeptical views created an intellectual crisis in seventeenth-century Europe. One major response was offered by the French philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650). In his classic work, ''Meditations of First Philosophy'' (1641), Descartes sought to refute skepticism, but only after he had formulated the case for skepticism as powerfully as possible. Descartes argued that no matter what radical skeptical possibilities we imagine there are certain truths (e.g., that thinking is occurring, or that I exist) that are absolutely certain. Thus, the ancient skeptics were wrong to claim that knowledge is impossible. Descartes also attempted to refute skeptical doubts about the reliability of our senses, our memory, and other cognitive faculties. To do this, Descartes tried to prove that God exists and that God would not allow us to be systematically deceived about the nature of reality. Many contemporary philosophers question whether this second stage of Descartes’ critique of skepticism is successful.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Popkin, ''The History of Skepticism'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century a powerful new case for skepticism was offered by the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776). Hume was an empiricist, claiming that all genuine ideas can be traced back to original impressions of sensation or introspective consciousness. Hume argued forcefully that on empiricist grounds there are no sound reasons for belief in God, an enduring self or soul, an external world, causal necessity, objective morality, or inductive reasoning. In fact, he argued that “Philosophy would render us entirely Pyrrhonian, were not Nature too strong for it.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Popkin, "Skepticism," p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hume saw it, the real basis of human belief is not reason, but custom or habit. We are hard-wired by nature to trust, say, our memories or inductive reasoning, and no skeptical arguments, however powerful, can dislodge those beliefs. In this way, Hume embraced what he called a “mitigated” skepticism, while rejecting an “excessive” Pyrrhonian skepticism that he saw as both impractical and psychologically impossible.

Hume’s skepticism provoked a number of important responses. Hume’s Scottish contemporary, [[Thomas Reid]] (1710–1796), challenged Hume’s strict empiricism and argued that it is rational to accept “common-sense” beliefs such as the basic reliability of our senses, our reason, our memories, and inductive reasoning, even though none of these things can be proved. In Reid’s view, such common-sense beliefs are foundational and require no proof in order to be rationally justified.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, "Skepticism," p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after Hume’s death, the great German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that human moral awareness makes no sense unless we reject Hume’s skeptical conclusions about the existence of God, the soul, free will, and an afterlife. According to Kant, while Hume was right to claim that we cannot strictly ''know'' any of these things, our moral experience entitles us to believe in them.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, "Skepticism," p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, skepticism continues to be a topic of lively debate among philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., John Greco, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious skepticism==
{{Main|Religious skepticism}}
Religious skepticism generally refers to doubting given religious beliefs or claims. Historically, religious skepticism can be traced back to [[Socrates]], who doubted many religious claims of the time. Modern religious skepticism typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods or evidence, with [[Michael Shermer]] writing that skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance{{clarify|date=February 2016}}. For example, a religious skeptic might believe that [[Jesus]] existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see [[historicity of Jesus]]). Religious skepticism is not the same as [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], though these often do involve skeptical attitudes toward religion and philosophical theology (for example, towards divine [[omnipotence]]). Religious people are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Additionally, they may also be skeptical of the claims made by atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Daniel|title=Skeptical of Atheism|url=http://mannsword.blogspot.com/2009/12/skeptical-of-atheism.html|publisher=Apologetics for Today|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Will Durant]] writes that [[Plato]] was "as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma."

== Scientific skepticism ==
{{Main|Skeptical movement#Scientific skepticism}}
A scientific or [[empirical]] skeptic is one who questions beliefs on the basis of scientific understanding.

[[Scientific]] skepticism may discard beliefs pertaining to ''purported phenomena'' not subject to reliable observation and thus not systematic or [[falsifiability|testable]] empirically. Most scientists, being scientific skeptics, test the reliability of certain kinds of claims by subjecting them to a systematic investigation using some type of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/scientific_skepticism_csicop_and_the_local_groups|title=Scientific Skepticism, CSICOP, and the Local Groups - CSI|website=www.csicop.org|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience|a number of claims]] are considered as "[[pseudoscience]]", if they are found to improperly apply or ignore the fundamental aspects of the scientific method.

== Professional skepticism ==
Professional skepticism is an important concept in auditing.  It requires an auditor to have a "questioning mind," to make a critical assessment of evidence, and to consider the sufficiency of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AU230.aspx#ps-pcaob_1c410f9b-5033-4f18-b865-af1307863bee|title=AU 230 Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work|website=pcaobus.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder''''' is a 1970 book by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It is the third in his four-book [[Nature of Man Series]].

The book extended Ardrey's refutation of the prevailing conviction within social sciences that all social behavior is purely learned and not governed by innate patterns. Through interwoven analyses of animals and human social structures Ardrey argued that inherited evolutionary traits are an important determining factor in social behavior.

Ardrey dedicated ''The Social Contract'' to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], after whose [[The Social Contract|1762 work]] the book was titled.&lt;ref name=Lore&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher. "Books of the Times: Lore and Order." ''The New York Times,'' 5 October 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Social Contract'' was published in 1970. It was the third book in Ardrey's ''Nature of Man'' series, following ''[[African Genesis]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' (1966) and preceding ''[[The Hunting Hypothesis]]'' (1976).

''The Social Contract'' continues Ardrey's work on understanding how evolutionarily inherited traits are manifest by contemporary man. In particular ''The Social Contract'' examines society and hierarchy in terms of genetic diversity. The edition cites many of the scientists who were important influences on Ardrey, including [[Raymond Dart]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]].&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; It was illustrated, like the first two books, by Ardrey's wife, the South African actress and illustrator Berdine Ardrey (née Grunewald).

''The Social Contract'' is a more ideologically motivated book than the other works in his ''Nature of Man'' series.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; It made assertions about how the social contract ''should'' be organized based on the evolutionary nature of man. In his last chapter, Ardrey writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolutionary nature of man represents, as I see it, a subject for the new philosophy, the new theologian. A set of common assumptions, common dedications, common assurances, of rules and regulations, even considering the limitations of homo sapiens, remains someday possible. As all of our parochial dedications have been eroded by the wash of the science, still a religion unassailable by the sciences exists as a goal worthy of contemporary ambition.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder.'' New York: Atheneum. 1970. 405 pp. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Social Contract'' also called for a reasoned respect of nature (in his next book, ''The Hunting Hypothesis'', Ardrey would be one of the first to warn of climate change as an existential threat to humanity).&lt;ref name=HH&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man." 1976. New York: Atheneum. 231 pp. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Social Contract'' he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The philosophy of the impossible has been the dominant motive in human affairs for the past two centuries. We have pursued the mastery of nature as if we ourselves were not a portion of that nature. We have boasted of our command over our physical environment while we ourselves have done our urgent best to destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;Ardrey, Robert (2014-05-15).

Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==
Compared to the other works in the ''Nature of Man'' series, ''The Social Contract'' inspired more controversy and received more negative reviews. Furthermore, the central theses of the other three books have come to be commonly accepted in scientific communities: [[African Genesis|''African Genesis'' (1961)]] posited that humans evolved from African meat-eaters instead of Asian carnivores;&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Territorial Imperative|''The Territorial Imperative'' (1966)]] demonstrated the influence of inherited territorial instincts on social formations;&lt;ref name="TI"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations." New York: Atheneum. 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Hunting Hypothesis|''The Hunting Hypothesis'' (1976)]] showed the importance of hunting behavior on the evolutionary course of early man.&lt;ref name="HH"/&gt; Because the core of the book is a social proposal and not a scientific hypothesis this is not the case with ''The Social Contract.''

Part of the controversy surrounding ''The Social Contract'' had to do with its theses on inequality. According to Ardrey, because each individual is born with a unique combination of genetically-determined traits, these traits can be evaluated by the environment, and therefore the diversity of phenotypes becomes inequality.&lt;ref name=Humans&gt;Stade, George. "Humans Act, Animals Behave: The Social Contract." ''The New York Times,'' 22 November 1970. Print&lt;/ref&gt; For Ardrey the only way to have a realistic optimism about society was to recognize this inequality. In the words of the reviewer for ''News/Check,'' "A society of equals, Ardrey argues, is a natural impossibility — things just don't work that way, and those who argue otherwise (conservatives as well as liberals) are denying possibilities of change; they also deny, and this is important to Ardrey, optimism."&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Ardrey: Writing with Insight" ''News/Check.'' January, 1971. pp.31-3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardrey argued, therefore, that inequality was not necessarily a social evil, but he emphasized that it could only be justly expressed given absolute equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; He also applied evolutionary theory on the level of groups, a move that continues to be scientifically controversial.&lt;ref name=Sci2&gt;Davis, Steve. "The Richard Dawkins Dilemma - Illusions of Natural Selection." From Science 2.0. Posted 15 September 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2015. Available [http://www.science20.com/gadfly/blog/richard_dawkins_dilemma_illusions_natural_selection-32425 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to insisting on the necessity for absolute equality of opportunity, Ardrey argued that the presence of inequality does not justify the domination of the weak by the strong. Rather "Ardrey showed that in all societies at any level of the animal world, structures exist to protect the vulnerable, and that this is an evolutionary advantage as it protects diversity, diversity being essential for creativity."&lt;ref name=Sci2 /&gt;

==Legacy==
The central thesis of Ardrey's series, namely that evolutionary characteristics are manifest in human social relations, has become widely accepted. This shift signaled a major change in the social sciences, particularly in [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. Robert Wokler, on the importance of Ardrey's approach, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What ought to be studied, according to Ardrey, are the relations between individuals that stem from the innate and universal attributes of animal life, whereas cultural anthropologists who detect a fundamental discontinuity between mankind and other zoological species are just impervious to the revolutionary ideas of Darwinism which have reverberated throughout all the life sciences apart from their own.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;Wokler, Robert. Garsten, Bryan (ed.). "Perfectible Apes in Decadent Cultures: Rousseaus' Anthropology Revisited." pp. 1-28. ''Rousseau, the Age of Enlightenment, and Their Legacies.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. 416 pp. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1972, defending his movie ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' from [[Fred M. Hechinger]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey. In particular, he quoted ''The Social Contract'' (along with ''[[African Genesis]]'').&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley. Letter from Stanley Kubrick to The New York Times. "Now Kubrick Fights Back." ''The New York Times,'' 27 February 1972, section 2, pp. 1 &amp; 11. Print. Retrievable [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q47.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick was a notable fan of Ardrey's work, and also cited him as an inspiration for his 1968 film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D.

'''''The Transparent Society''''' (1998) is a non-fiction book by the science-fiction author [[David Brin]] in which he forecasts [[Transparency (social)|social transparency]] and some degree of erosion of [[privacy]], as it is overtaken by low-cost [[surveillance]], [[communication]] and [[database]] technology, and proposes new institutions and practices that he believes would provide benefits that would more than compensate for lost privacy.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:David Brin at ACM CFP 2005dsc278c.jpg|thumb|right|150px|David Brin with [[sousveillance]] "maybecamera" at the Association of Computing Machinery's (ACM's) CFP conference where such a [[sousveillance]] device was given to each attendee. Brin participated in the [http://wearcam.org/cfp2005 Opening Keynote] on the "inverse panopticon".]]
Brin argues that a core level of privacy—protecting our most intimate interactions—may be preserved, despite the rapid proliferation of cameras that become ever-smaller, cheaper and more numerous faster than [[Moore's law]]. He feels that this core privacy can be saved simply because that is what humans deeply need and want. Hence, Brin explains that "...the key question is whether citizens will be potent, sovereign and knowing enough to enforce this deeply human want."

This means they must not only have rights, but also the power to use them and the ability to detect when they are being abused. That will only happen in a world that is mostly open, in which most citizens know most of what is going on, most of the time. It is the only condition under which citizens may have some chance of catching the violators of their freedom and privacy. Privacy is only possible if freedom (including the freedom to know) is protected first.

Brin thus maintains that privacy is a "contingent right," one that grows out of the more primary rights, e.g. to know and to speak. He admits that such a mostly-open world will seem more irksome and demanding; people will be expected to keep negotiating the tradeoffs between knowing and privacy. It will be tempting to pass laws that restrict the power of surveillance to authorities, entrusting them to protect our privacy—or a comforting illusion of privacy. By contrast, a transparent society destroys that illusion by offering everyone access to the vast majority of information out there.

Brin argues that it will be good for society if the powers of surveillance are shared with the citizenry, allowing "[[sousveillance]]" or "viewing from below," enabling the public to watch the watchers. According to Brin, this only continues the same trend promoted by [[Adam Smith]], [[John Locke]], the US Constitutionalists and the western enlightenment, who held that any elite (whether commercial, governmental, or aristocratic) should experience constraints upon its power. And there is no power-equalizer greater than knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2010/07/if-corporations-are-persons.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- ref is for whole section --&gt;

== Inverse transparency and bi-directional transparency ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
Transparency is sometimes confused with [[equiveillance]] (the balance between [[surveillance]] and [[sousveillance]]).  This balance (equilibrium) allows the individual to construct their own case from evidence they gather themselves, rather than merely having access to surveillance data that could possibly incriminate them. Sousveillance therefore, in addition to transparency, assures contextual integrity of surveillance data (i.e. a [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/siliconvalley/events/carpe2004/default.htm lifelong capture of personal experience] can provide "best evidence" over surveillance data to prevent the surveillance-only data from being taken out of context).

Somewhat more nuanced than simply being "against privacy," Brin spends an entire chapter exploring how important some degree of privacy is for most human beings, allowing them moments of intimacy, to exchange confidences, and to prepare - in some security - for the competitive world.  Nevertheless, he suggests that we currently have more privacy than our ancestors, in part, because "the last two hundred years have opened information flows, rather than shutting them down.  Citizens are more able to catch violators of their rights - and hold them accountable - than commonfolk were in the old villages, that were dominated by local gentry, gossips and bullies."

This might seem counter-intuitive at first. But he uses the song "[[Harper Valley PTA]]" as a metaphor for how people can protect their eccentricities, and even some privacy, by assertively "looking back."  Brin also points to restaurants, in which social disapproval keeps people from staring and eavesdropping, even though they can.  Enforcement of this social rule is possible because everybody can see.

From this perspective, a coming era of "most of the people, knowing most of what's going on, most of the time," would only be an extension of what already gave us the Enlightenment, freedom and privacy. By comparison, he asks what the alternative would be: "To pass privacy laws that will be enforced by elites, and trust them to refrain from looking at us?"

Brin participated in the opening keynote panel discussion at the 2005 [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference, where 500 sousveillance devices were also created to contextualize and explore this debate further. (Each attendee was given a wearable camera-dome bag which created, in effect, an inverse [[panopticon]].)

==Use of the concept in Brin's other works==

Brin has introduced versions of the concept into his fiction.

In ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]],'' the setting's future history includes a war pitting most of the Earth against [[Switzerland]], fueled by outrage over the Swiss allowing generations of [[kleptocracy|kleptocrats]] to hide their stolen wealth in the country's secretive [[Banking in Switzerland|banks]]. The war results in the end of secret banking and the destruction of Switzerland as a nation. In the setting's present, surveillance by elderly retirees wearing recognizable networked camera-glasses is common.

His novel ''[[Kiln People]]'' is set in a future where cameras are everywhere and anyone can access the public ones and, for a fee, the private ones.

The '''Vancouver system''', also known as '''Vancouver reference style''' or the '''author–number system''', is a [[citation]] style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the [[physical sciences]] and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the [[Harvard referencing|author–date, or "Harvard", system]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{vcite web|title=Reference styles|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/library/library-guide/reference-styles|date=|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | publisher   = [[United States National Library of Medicine]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver style is used by [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]].&lt;ref name="Citing_Medicine"&gt;{{Citation |last=Patrias |first=Karen |editor-last=Wendling |editor-first=Dan |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |location=[[Bethesda, Maryland]], USA |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine |postscript=. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of [[scientific journals]] use author-number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as [[punctuation]], [[letter case#Case styles|casing of titles]], and [[italic type|italic]], vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names "Vancouver system" or "Vancouver style" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', per the ''References &gt; Style and Format'' section of the ICMJE Recommendations.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author-number system regardless of the formatting details.  A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author-number format specified by the [[ICMJE Recommendations]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM).  For example, the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA reference style]] is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author-number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed).

==History==
Author–number systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of [[citation]] style in [[scientific journal]]s (the other being [[parenthetical referencing|author–date]]). In 1978, a committee of editors from various [[medical journal]]s, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]] to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author–number principle.

The URMs were developed 15 years before the [[World Wide Web]] debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=2001512 |pmc=1669007 |year=1991 |month=Feb |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=338–341 |issn=0959-8138 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1995 ''[[CMAJ]]'' publication&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=7728695 |pmc=1337910 |year=1995 |month=May |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=1459–1473 |issn=0820-3946 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=8992922 |year=1997 |month=Jan |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. |author=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |issn=0003-4819 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8992922 |format=Free full text |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-1-199701010-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' version&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=9062335 |year=1997 |month=Mar |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=927–934 |issn=0098-7484 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.927}}&lt;/ref&gt; when reprinting the ''Uniform requirements''.

In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE website] itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of ''[[Haematologica]]'' decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the ''Uniform requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15020262 |year=2004 |month=Mar |author=International Committee Of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing and editing for biomedical publication |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=264 |issn=0390-6078 |journal=Haematologica |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15020262 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early to mid-2000s, the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (which runs [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]]) has hosted the ICMJE's "Sample References" pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html |author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors | title = Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Sample References | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2007, the NLM created ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', its [[style guide]] for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to ''[[Citing Medicine]]'' as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt; For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (''References &gt; Style and Format'').&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt;

==Sample usage==

===Labelling citations===
References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]''' (1)''', [[square brackets]]''' [1]''', [[superscript]]'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:

{{quote|Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

And the entry in the reference list would be: 1. {{cite journal|vauthors=Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL|title=A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture.|pmid=20925999|journal=J Int Med Res|date=2010|volume=38|pages=1266–1275}}

===Placing citations===
Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed ''outside'' the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, ''or'' be placed ''inside'' the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions.&lt;ref name="url_Leicester"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/help/citing/vancouver-numbered-system | title = Vancouver (Numbered) System | publisher = University of Leicester  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlmedind.nic.in"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t04/i1/jbct04i1p21.pdf | title = Reference systems deciphered for you | publisher = Department of Forensic Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Patiala }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges,&lt;ref name="urllibrary.vcc.ca"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | title = Vancouver Citation Style | publisher = Vancouver Community College | quote = The citation in brackets is placed after any commas and periods, and before any colons and semi-colons | accessdate = 2015-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043418/http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-09 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]]&lt;ref name="urlMLA Citation Style | Cornell University Library"&gt;{{vcite web | url = https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla | title = MLA Citation Style | publisher =  Cornell University Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IEEE]]&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to [[Chicago Style Manual]].)&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | title = IEEE Citation Reference | format =  | work = IEEE | quote = References ... appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195511/http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | archivedate = 2011-04-08 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Vancouver system documents (the [[ICMJE recommendations]] and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark.

===Format of citations===
Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles etc. Author names are abbreviated to at most two initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/ |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet] | edition=2nd | first = K | last = Patrias | editor-first  = D | editor-last = Wendling |location=Bethesda, MD | publisher = National Library of Medicine (US) | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | quote = Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Citing Medicine'' does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. "R. K." would be merged into "RK"), the examples used throughout the book do.

====Journal articles====

=====Standard journal articles=====
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498.
* Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I. Inferior oncological prognosis of surgery without oral chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in clinical settings. World J Surg Oncol. 2014 May 10;12(1):145. [Epub ahead of print]

As an option, if a journal carries continuous pagination throughout a volume (as many medical journals do), the month and issue number may be omitted.

* Thomas MC. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs – the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by "[[et al.]]" (which most medical journals do not italicize):

* Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med. 2006 May 11;354(19):1985-1997.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's [[digital object identifier|DOI]] or [[PubMed#PubMed identifier|PMID]]) may be added to the citation:

* von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. {{PMID|8502295}}.

NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184–5), or both (184–185).

Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts "[Epub Year Mon Day]" (for online-only publication) or "[Epub ahead of print]" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, [[AMA style]] puts "[published online Month Day, Year]" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term "Epub" and no longer includes the words "ahead of print". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication).

The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the [[supraorganization]]al level by documents including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7251/ ''Citing Medicine'' at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z39.5, [[ISO 4|ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications]], and the [http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/ ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA)].

=====Articles not in English=====
As per journal articles in English:

* Forneau E, Bovet D. Recherches sur l'action sympathicolytique d'un nouveau dérivé du dioxane. Arch Int Pharmacodyn. 1933;46:178-191. French.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] adds an English translation of the title enclosed in square brackets right after the title. The language is specified in full after the location (pagination), followed by a period.&lt;!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/box/A33262/?report=objectonly --&gt;
