Other [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] cultures have traditionally had similar spiritual mediators, although [[Alaskan Native religion]] has many forms and variants.

==Role in Inuit society==
Both women and men could become an angakkuq,&lt;ref name="Freuchen 1960"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freuchen|first1=Dagmar|title=Peter Freuchen's Adventures in the Arctic|date=1960|publisher=Messner|location=New York|page=136||accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although it was rarer for women to do so. The process for becoming an angakkuq varied widely. The son of a current angakkuq might be trained by his father to become one as well. Alternatively, a young man or woman who exhibited a predilection or power that made them stand out might be trained by an experienced mentor. There are also instances of angakkuit claiming to have been called to the role through dreams or visions.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; Mistreated orphans or people who had survived hard times might also become angakkuit with the help of the spirits of their dead loved ones.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt; 

Training to become an angakkuq consisted of acculturation to the rites and roles necessary for the position, as well as instruction in the special language of the angakkuit,&lt;ref name="Freuchen 1960b"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freuchen|first1=Dagmar|title=Peter Freuchen's Adventures in the Arctic|date=1960|publisher=Messner|location=New York|page=132||accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which consisted largely of an archaic vocabulary and oral tradition that was shared across much of the Arctic areas the Inuit occupied. During their training, the angakkuq would also gain a familiar or spirit guide who would be visible only to them.&lt;ref name=bastian&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Bastian, Dawn E.  |author2=Mitchell, Judy K. | title = Handbook of Native American Mythology | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2004 | location = Santa Barbara, California | pages = 47–49 | isbn = 1-85109-533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guide, called a [[Inuit religion|tuurngaq]], would at times give them extraordinary powers. Inuit stories tell of agakkuit who could run as fast as [[caribou]], or who could fly, with the assistance of their tuurngaq. In some traditions, the angakkuq would be either stabbed or shot, receiving no wound because of the intervention of their tuurngaw, thus proving their power.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt;

Until spiritual guidance or assistance was needed, an angakkuq lived a normal life for an Inuit, participating in society as a normal person. But when sickness needed to be cured, or divination of the causes of various misfortunes was needed, the angakkuq would be called on.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; The services of an angakkuit might also be required to interpret dreams.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt; If they were called to perform actions that helped the entire village, the work was usually done freely. But if they were called to help an individual or family, they would usually receive remuneration for their efforts.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; 

Amongst the Inuit, there are notions comparable to laws:
* ''tirigusuusiit'', things to avoid
* ''maligait'', things to follow
* ''piqujait'', things to do
If these three are not obeyed, then the angakkuq may need to intervene with the offending party in order to avoid harmful consequence to the person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradition-orale.ca/english/tirigusuusiit-and-maligait-58.html |title=  
Tirigusuusiit and Maligait |accessdate=2007-10-17 |work=tradition-orale.ca| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071114230224/http://www.tradition-orale.ca/english/tirigusuusiit-and-maligait-58.html| archivedate= 14 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking these laws or taboos was seen as the cause of misfortune, such as bad weather, accidents, or unsuccessful hunts. In order to pinpoint the cause of such misfortune, the angakkuq would undertake a spirit-guided journey outside of their body. They would discover the cause of the misfortune on this journey. Once they returned from the journey, the angakkuq would question people involved in the situation, and, under the belief that they already knew who was responsible, the people being questioned would often confess. This confession alone could be declared the solution to the problem, or acts of penance such as cleaning the urine pots or swapping wives might be necessary.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt;

The angakkuit of the central Inuit participate in an annual ceremony to appease the mythological figure [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], the Sea Woman. The Inuit believed that Sedna became angry when her taboos were broken, and the only way to appease her was for an angakkuq to travel in spirit to the underworld where she lived, [[Adlivun]], and smooth out her hair. According to myth, this was of great assistance to Sedna because she lacks fingers. The angakkuq would then beg or fight with Sedna to ensure that his people would not starve, and the Inuit believed that his pleading and apologies on behalf of his people would allow the animals to return and hunters to be successful. After returning from this spirit journey, communities in which the rite was practiced would have communal confessions, and then celebration.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt;

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Patriarchate Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|Chanters singing on the [[kliros]] at the [[St. George's Cathedral, Istanbul]]]]
In the practice of [[Christianity]], '''canonical hours''' mark the divisions of the day in terms of periods of fixed prayer at regular intervals. A [[book of hours]] normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The practice of daily prayers grew from the [[Judaism|Jewish]] practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as ''[[zmanim]]'': for example, in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Evangelist]] visit the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] for the afternoon prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psalm 119]]:164 states: "Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws" (of this, [[Symeon of Thessalonica]] writes that "the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit").&lt;ref&gt;St. Symeon, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice is believed to have been passed down through the centuries from the [[Apostles]], with different practices developing in different places. As [[Christian monasticism]] spread, the practice of specified hours and liturgical formats began to develop and become standardized. Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] began the process of recording the [[liturgy|liturgical]] practices around [[Jerusalem]], while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 181, 182, 187, and 189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 525, [[Benedict of Nursia]] set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the [[8th century]], to yield an office of great complexity.&lt;ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis&gt;Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 182, 184, 185, 187, and 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cluniac Reforms]] of the [[11th century]] renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], with [[Cluny Abbey]] at their head.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the [[Catholic Church]], canonical hours are also called ''offices'', since they refer to the official set of prayers of the Church, which is known variously as the ''officium divinum'' ("divine service" or "divine duty"), and the ''opus Dei'' ("work of God"). The current official version of the hours in the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church is called the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (Latin: ''liturgia horarum'') in North America or '''divine office''' in Ireland and Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In [[Anglicanism]], they are often known as the '''daily''' or '''divine office''', to distinguish them from the other 'offices' of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the canonical hours may be referred to as the '''[[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine services]]''', and the ''book of hours'' is called the ''[[horologion]]'' ({{lang-el|῾Ωρολόγιον}}). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale. The usage in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and the Eastern Catholic counterparts all differ from each other and from other rites.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Already well-established by the [[9th century]] in the West, these canonical offices consisted of eight daily prayer events, including lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline, as well as the night office, sometimes referred to as vigils, consisting of a number of sections called 'nocturnes'. Building on the recitation of [[psalms]] and [[canticle]]s from [[Religious text|scripture]], the Church has added (and, at times, subtracted) [[hymn]]s, [[hagiography|hagiographical]] readings, and other prayers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Development ==

=== Judaism and the early church ===
The canonical hours stemmed from [[Jewish prayer]]. In the [[Old Testament]], God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and evening ({{bibleverse||Exodus|29:38–39}}). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the [[Tabernacle]] to [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], when the Temple was no longer in use, the first [[synagogue]]s were established, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of [[Torah readings]], [[psalms]], and [[hymn]]s began to evolve. This "sacrifice of praise" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals.

After the people returned to [[Judea]], the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well. As time passed, the Jews began to be scattered across the Greco-Roman world in what is known as the [[Jewish diaspora]]. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the Jews (and eventually early Christians) began to follow the Roman system of conducting the business day in scheduling their times for prayer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Roman cities, the [[bell]] in the [[forum (Roman)|forum]] rang the beginning of the business day at about six o'clock in the morning ([[prime (liturgy)|Prime]], the "first hour"), noted the day's progress by striking again at about nine o'clock in the morning ([[Terce]], the "third hour"), tolled for the lunch break at noon ([[Sext]], the "sixth hour"), called the people back to work again at about three o'clock in the afternoon ([[Nones (liturgy)|Nones]], the "ninth hour"), and rang the close of the business day at about six o'clock in the evening (the time for evening prayer).

The narrative of [[Jesus' crucifixion]] and death refers to the sixth and ninth hours:&lt;ref&gt;Mark 15:33–34, 37 (NKJV)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice ... and breathed His last.}}

The first miracle of the apostles, the healing of the crippled man on the temple steps, occurred because Saint Peter and John the Apostle went to the Temple to pray ({{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}). Also, one of the defining moments of the early Church, the decision to include [[Gentile]]s among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying at noontime ({{bibleverse||Acts|10:9–49}}).

As [[Christianity]] began to separate from [[Judaism]], the practice of praying at fixed times continued. The early church was known to pray the Psalms ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:23–30}}), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the [[Didache]], the oldest known liturgical manual for Christians, recommended disciples to pray the [[Lord's Prayer]] three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 – c. 113), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: "they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', Book X, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=117&amp;fk_files=2025 Letter xcvii].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second and third centuries, such [[Church Fathers]] as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Tertullian]] wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours. The prayers could be prayed individually or in groups.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Sundialtide.JPG|thumb|A [[sundial]] showing the four Tides and five Canonical hours, based on the example on the [[Bewcastle Cross]]]]
As the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the [[Christian monastic]] communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in [[monastery|monasteries]]. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).

In the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to [[Constantinople]]. In particular, [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 – c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis /&gt; and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see ''[[typikon]]'' for further details).

In the West, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was modeled his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the [[basilica]]s of [[Rome]]. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum ''Ora et labora'' – "Pray and work". The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the ''Opus Dei'' or "Work of God." The fixed-hour prayers came to be known as the "Divine Office" (office coming from the Latin word for duty).

As the Divine Office grew more important in the life of the Church, the rituals became more elaborate. Praying the Office already required various books, such as a [[Psalter]] for the psalms, a [[lectionary]] to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a [[Bible]] to proclaim the reading, a [[hymnal]] for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from [[cathedral]]s and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the [[breviary]], which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used. The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where [[Pope Innocent III]] extended their use to the [[Roman Curia]]. The [[Franciscans]] sought a one-volume breviary for their [[friar]]s to use during travels, so the order adopted the ''[[Breviarium Curiae]]'', but  substituting the [[Gallican Rite]] Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, [[Pope Nicholas III]] adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.

== Roman Rite since the Council of Trent ==

=== Texts ===

==== Revision by Pope Pius V ====
The [[Council of Trent]], in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Trent, ''Decree on Reformation'', [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/trentall.html Chapter XXI]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 1568, [[Pope Pius V]], the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the [[Roman Breviary]], with his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Quod a nobis'', imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his [[Roman Missal]] and using language very similar to that in the bull ''[[Quo primum]]'' with which he promulgated the Missal, regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions, the obligation to use the promulgated text in all places, and the total prohibition of adding or omitting anything, declaring in fact: "No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/novusordo.html In Defense of the Pauline Mass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Further revision before the Second Vatican Council ====
Later Popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. [[Pope Clement VIII]] made changes that he made obligatory on 10 May 1602, 34 years after Pius V's revision. [[Pope Urban VIII]] made further changes, including "a profound alteration in the character of some of the hymns. Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02768b.htm Breviary] in Catholic Encyclopedia. The article also spoke of "blemishes which disfigure this book."&lt;/ref&gt; For the profound revision of the book by Pope Pius X see [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]].

[[Pope Pius XII]] also began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the [[Psalms]] and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, [[Pope John XXIII]], made a further revision in 1960.

==== Revision following the Second Vatican Council ====

===== Latin typical editions =====
{{Main|Liturgy of the Hours}}

Following the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church's [[Roman Rite]] simplified the observance of the canonical hours and sought to make them more suited to the needs of today's apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.

The Council itself abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' Art 91. So that it may really be possible in practice to observe the course of the hours proposed in Art. 89, the psalms are no longer to be distributed throughout one week, but through some longer period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the succeeding revision, the character of Matins was changed to an Office of Readings so that it could be used at any time of the day as an office of Scriptural and hagiographical readings. Furthermore, the period over which the entire Psalter is recited has been expanded from one week to four. Since 1985, with the publication of the second typical edition of the Latin liturgical books, the Latin hymns of the Roman Office were once again restored to their pre-Urban revision.

The Roman breviary is now published under the title ''Liturgia Horarum''. A translation is published by Catholic Book Publishing Corp. under the title ''The Liturgy of the Hours'' in four volumes, arranged according to the liturgical seasons of the Church year.
* Volume I: Advent &amp; Christmastide
* Volume II: Lent, the Sacred Triduum &amp; Eastertide
* Volume III: Weeks 1 to 17 of the Year
* Volume IV: Weeks 18 to 34 of the Year

The current [[liturgical book]]s for the celebration of the Hours in Latin are those of the '' editio typica altera'' (second typical edition) promulgated in 1985. The official title is ''Officium Divinum, Liturgia Horarum iuxta Ritum Romanum, editio typica altera''.

===== Official English translations =====

Two English translations are in use.

======The Divine Office (non-ICEL)======
''The Divine Office'' is translated by a commission set up by the Episcopal Conferences of England and Wales, Australia and Ireland. First published in 1974 by [[HarperCollins]], this edition is the official English edition for use the above countries, as well as many Asian and African dioceses. This title comes complete in three volumes:
* Volume I: [[Advent]], [[Christmastide]] &amp; Weeks 1–9 of the Year
* Volume II: [[Lent]] and [[Eastertide]]
* Volume III: [[Ordinary Time|Weeks of the Year]] (6–34).

The psalms are taken from the 1963 [[Grail Psalms]], while the Scriptural readings and canticles are taken from various versions of the Bible, including the [[Revised Standard Version]], the [[Jerusalem Bible]], the [[Knox Bible]], the [[Good News Bible]], and the [[New English Bible]].

Collins also publishes shorter editions of The Divine Office:
* Daily Prayer – comprising the complete Divine Office, except for the Office of Readings
* Morning &amp; Evening Prayer – comprising the complete Morning, Evening and Night prayers from the Divine Office
* Shorter Morning &amp; Evening Prayer – comprising the Psalter for Morning, Evening and Night prayers and a selection of texts from the liturgical seasons and feasts
Between 2005 and 2006, Collins republished ''The Divine Office'' and its various shorter editions with a new cover.

[[Catholic Truth Society]] published Prayer During the Day in 2009.

======Liturgy of the Hours (ICEL)======
The ''Liturgy of the Hours'' is translated by the [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy]] (ICEL). First published in 1975 by Catholic Book Publishing Company in the US, this edition is the official English edition for use in the US, Canada and several other English-speaking dioceses. This title comes complete in four volumes in an arrangement identical to the original Latin typical edition.

The psalms are taken mainly from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scriptural readings and canticles are taken from the [[New American Bible]].

Shorter editions of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] are also available from various publishers: Christian Prayer (Daughters of St Paul and Catholic Book Publishing Company), Shorter Christian Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company only) and Daytime Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company). In 2007, Liturgy Training Publications released the new Mundelein Psalter, which provided the complete Morning, Evening and Night Prayers from ICEL's translation set to chant tones.

Both these editions are based on the Latin 1971 ''editio typica''.

=== Current practice ===
Priests are required by [[canon law]] to pray the entire Divine Office each day while permanent deacons are required to pray the morning and evening hours. All clerics are free to use the Liturgy of the Hours or the traditional [[Roman Breviary]], according to the ''motu proprio'' [[Summorum Pontificum]], to fulfill this obligation. The practice among religious communities varies according to their rules and constitutions. The [[Second Vatican Council]] also exhorted the Christian laity to take up the practice, and as a result, many lay people have begun reciting portions of the Liturgy of the Hours.

The modern Liturgy of the Hours usage focuses on three major hours and from two to four minor hours:
* [[Invitatory]] (not an hour properly called, but the introduction to the first hour said on the current day, whether it be the Office of Readings or Morning Prayer).
* the Office of Readings (formerly [[Matins]]), major hour
* Morning prayer ([[Lauds]]), major hour
* [[Little Hours|Daytime prayer]], which can be one or all of
** Midmorning prayer ([[Terce]])
** Midday prayer ([[Sext]])
** Midafternoon prayer ([[None (liturgy)|None]])
* Evening prayer ([[Vespers]]), major hour
* Night Prayer ([[Compline]])

==== Major hours ====
The major hours consist of the Office of Readings (formerly [[Matins]]), Morning (or [[Lauds]]) and Evening Prayer (or [[Vespers]]).

The Office of Readings consists of:
* a [[hymn]]
* one or two long [[psalms]] divided into three parts
* a long passage from scripture, usually arranged so that in any one week, all the readings come from the same text
* a long hagiographical passage, such as an account of a [[saint]]'s [[martyr]]dom, or a theological treatise commenting on some aspect of the scriptural reading, or a passage from the documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]]
* on nights preceding Sundays and feast days, the office may be expanded to a ''vigil'' by inserting three [[Old Testament]] [[canticle]]s and a reading from the [[gospels]]
* the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'' (solemnities, feasts, and Sundays outside of Lent)
* the concluding prayer
* a short concluding verse

The character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Both follow the same format:
* a hymn
* two psalms, or one long psalm divided into two parts, and a scriptural canticle (taken from the Old Testament in the morning and the [[New Testament]] in the evening)
* a short passage from scripture
* a [[responsory]], typically a verse of scripture, but sometimes liturgical poetry
* a canticle taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]]: the Canticle of Zechariah (''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]'') for morning prayer, and the Canticle of Mary (''[[Magnificat]]'') for evening prayer
* intercessions
* the [[Lord's Prayer]]
* the concluding prayer
* a blessing given by the [[priest]] or [[deacon]] leading Morning or Evening Prayer, or in the absence of clergy and in individual recitation, a short conclusion

==== Minor hours ====
The [[Little Hours|daytime hours]] follow a simpler format:
* a hymn
* three short psalms, or, three pieces of longer psalms; in the daytime hours the psalmody is taken in large part from psalm 119, the longest in the Psalter
* a very short passage of scripture, followed by a responsorial verse
* the concluding prayer
* a short concluding verse

Night prayer has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life:
* an [[examination of conscience]]
* a hymn
* one or two psalms
* a short reading from scripture
* the responsory ''In manus tuas, Domine'' (Into Your Hands, Lord)
* the Canticle of Simeon, [[Nunc dimittis]], from the [[Gospel of Luke]], framed by the [[antiphon]] ''Protect us, Lord''
* a concluding prayer
* a short concluding blessing
* a [[Hymns to Mary|hymn to Mary, the mother of Jesus]]

In each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons, and each concludes with the traditional Catholic [[doxology]].

==== Liturgical variation ====
In addition to the distribution of almost the whole Psalter over a four-week cycle, the Church also provides appropriate hymns, readings, psalms, canticles and antiphons, for use in marking specific celebrations in the [[Roman Calendar]], which sets out the order for the [[liturgical year]]. These selections are found in the 'Proper of Seasons' (for [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], [[Lent]] and [[Easter]]), and the 'Proper of Saints' (for [[Calendar of saints|feast days]] of the Saints).

=== Historical development ===
{{further|Typicon#Historical development}}

[[File:Monks and Seminarians on Cliros in Jordanville.jpg|thumb|300px|Monks and Seminarians on Cliros. [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]]]

Because the [[Byzantine Rite|Rite of Constantinople]] evolved as a synthesis of two distinct rites — cathedral rite of Constantinople called the "asthmatiki akolouthia" ("sung services") and the monastic typicon of the [[Mar Saba|Holy Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified]] near [[Jerusalem]] — its offices are highly developed and quite complex.

=== Local variations ===
Two main strata exist in the rite, those places that have inherited the traditions of the Russian Church which had been given only the monastic Sabbaite typicon which she uses to this day&lt;ref&gt;Тvпико́нъ сіесть уста́въ (The Typicon which is the Order), p 1&lt;/ref&gt; in parishes and cathedrals as well as in monasteries, and everywhere else where some remnant of the cathedral rite remained in use; therefore, the rite as practiced in monasteries everywhere resembles the Russian recension, while non-Russian non-monastic customs differs significantly. For example, in the Russian tradition, the "[[all-night vigil]]" is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (all though it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have [[Matins]] on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, [[Vespers]] and matins are rather less abridged but the [[Divine Liturgy]] commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.

Also, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holy-trinity.org/liturgics/krivoshein-greekandrussian.html "Some differences between Greek and Russian divine services and their significance by Basil Krivoshein, Archbishop of Brussels and Belgium"], retrieved 2012-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liturgical books ===
The '''[[Horologion]]''' ({{lang|grc|῾Ωρολόγιον}}; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Chasoslov'', ''Часocлoвъ''), or  ''Book of Hours'', provides the [[Acolouthia|fixed portions]] of the Daily Cycle of services ({{lang-el|akolouthies}}, {{lang|grc|ἀκολουθίες}}) as used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic churches]].

Into this fixed framework, numerous moveable parts of the service are inserted. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books:
* '''[[Psalter]]''' (Greek: ''Ψαλτήρ(ιον), Psalter(ion)''; Slavonic: ''Ѱалтырь'' or ''Ѱалтирь, Psaltyr' '') A book containing the 150 [[Psalms]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;There is also a [[Psalm 151]] which is often included in the Psalter, though it is not actually chanted during the Divine Services.&lt;/ref&gt; divided into 20 sections called [[Kathisma]]ta together with the nine Biblical [[canticle]]s which are chanted at Matins; although these canticles had been chanted in their entirety, having over time come to be supplemented by interspersed hymns (analogously to [[sticheron|stichera]]) to form  the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], the canticles themselves are now only regularly used in a few large monasteries.&lt;ref group=note&gt;excepting in the Russian tradition where they are used weekly on weekdays of Great Lent.&lt;/ref&gt; The Psalter also contains the various "selected psalms", each composed of verses from a variety of psalms, sung at matins on feast days, as well as tables for determining which Kathismata are to be read at each service; in addition to the Psalms read at the daily offices, all the Psalms are read each week and, during Great Lent, twice a week.
* '''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]''' (Greek: ''Ὀκτώηχος''; Slavonic: ''Октоихъ, Oktoikh'' or ''Осмогласникъ, Osmoglasnik'')—Literally, the Book of the "Eight Tones"  or [[Musical mode|modes]]. This book contains a cycle of eight weeks, one for each of the eight [[Echos|echoi]] ([[Gregorian mode|church modes]] of the [[Octoechos|Byzantine musical system of eight modes]]), providing texts for each day of the week for Vespers, Matins, Compline, and (on Sundays) the Midnight Office. The origins of this book go back to compositions by [[John of Damascus|St. John Damascene]].
* '''[[Menaion]]''' (Greek: ''Μηναίον''; Slavonic: ''Минеѧ, Mineya'')—A twelve-volume set which provides liturgical texts for each day of the calendar year,&lt;ref group=note&gt;On non-leap years, the service for 29 Feb. ([[John Cassian|St. John Cassian]]) is chanted at Compline on 28 Feb..&lt;/ref&gt; printed as 12 volumes, one for each month of the year.&lt;ref group=note name=Year_Starts_in_September&gt;The liturgical year begins in September, so the volumes are numbered from 1 for September to 12 for August.&lt;/ref&gt; Another volume, the ''General Menaion'' contains propers for each class of saints for use when the propers for a particular saint are not available. Additionally, locally venerated saints may have services in supplemental volumes, pamphlets, or manuscripts.
* '''[[Menologion]]''' A collection of the lives of the saints and commentaries on the meaning of feasts for each day of the calendar year, also printed as 12 volumes,&lt;ref group=note name=Year_Starts_in_September /&gt; appointed to be read at the meal in monasteries and, when there is an all-night vigil for a feast day, between Vespers and Matins.
* '''[[Triodion]]''' (Greek: ''Τριῴδιον, Triodion''; Slavonic: ''Постнаѧ Трїωдь, Postnaya Triod' ''; Romanian: ''Triodul''), also called the '''Lenten Triodion'''.  The Lenten Triodion contains propers for:
** the [[Pre-Lenten Season]]
** the Forty Days of Great Lent itself
** [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]]
** [[Holy Week]]
* '''[[Pentecostarion]]''' (Greek: ''Πεντηκοστάριον, Pentekostarion''; Slavonic: ''Цвѣтнаѧ Трїωдь, Tsvetnaya Triod' '', literally "Flowery Triodon"; Romanian: ''Penticostar'') This volume contains the propers for the period from [[Easter|Pascha]] to the Sunday of All Saints. This period can be broken down into the following periods:
** [[Bright Week]] (Easter Week) Commencing with matins on [[Easter|Pascha (Easter Sunday)]]  through the following Saturday
** Paschal Season—The period from [[Thomas Sunday]] until [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]]
** Ascension and its [[Afterfeast]]
** Pentecost and its Afterfeast
** [[All Saints Day|All Saints Sunday]] (the Sunday after Pentecost)
* '''[[Synaxarion]]''' (Greek: ''Συναξάριον''; Romanian: ''Sinaxar'')—The [[Synaxarium|Synaxarion]] contains for each day of the year brief lives of the saints and meanings of celebrated feasts, appointed to be read after the Kontakion and Oikos at Matins.
* '''[[Irmologion]]''' (Greek: ''῾Ειρμολόγιον''; Slavonic: ''Ирмологий, Irmologii'')—Contains the [[Irmos|Irmoi]] chanted at the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of Matins and other services.
* '''[[Euchologion|Priest's Service Book]]''' (Greek: ''῾Ἱερατικόν, Ieratikon''; Slavonic: ''Слѹжебникъ, Sluzhebnik'')—Contain the portions of the services which are said by the priest and deacon and is given to a deacon and to a priest with his vestments at [[Holy orders|ordination]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally, the deacon's book and the priest's books were distinct, but upon the invention of printing, it was found more practical to combine them.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bishop's Service Book''' (Greek: ''Ἀρχιιερατικόν Archieratikon'', Slavonic: ''Чиновникъ, Chinovnik'') the portions of the services which are said by the Bishop; for the Canonical Hours, this differs little from what is in the Priest's Service Book.
* '''[[Gospel Book]]''' (Greek: Ευαγγέλιον, Evangelion) Book containing the 4 Gospels laid out as read at the divine services.&lt;ref group=note name=Editing_Gospel_and_Apostle&gt;In Greek editions the ''Evangélion'' is laid out in order of the cycle of readings as they occur in the ecclesiastical year, with a section in the back providing the Gospel readings for Matins, [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Feasts]] and special occasions. In the Slavic usage, the ''Evangélion'' contains the four gospels in canonical order ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]]) with annotations in the margin to indicate the beginning and ending of each reading (and an index in the back).&lt;br /&gt;The ''Apostól'' is likewise edited, the Slavonic ''Apostól'' having all of the books of the New Testament (excluding the Gospels and Apocalypse) in their entirety, though not in the same order they are found in most English Bibles ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] is placed first, followed by the Catholic Epistles, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Apostle Book''' (Greek: ''Απόστολος, Apostolos''; Slavonic: ''Апостолъ, Apostol'') Contains the readings for the Divine Liturgy from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Epistles]] together with the [[Prokeimenon]] and [[Alleluia]] verses that are chanted with the readings.&lt;ref group=note name=Editing_Gospel_and_Apostle /&gt;
* '''[[Patristic writings]]''' Many writings from the Church fathers are prescribed to be read at matins and, during great lent, at the hours; in practice, this is only done in some monasteries and frequently therein the abbot prescribes readings other than those in the written rubrics. therefore it is not customary to enumerate all the volumes required for this.
* '''Collections''' (Greek: ''Ανθολόγιον, Anthologion''; Slavonic: ''Сборникъ, Sbornik'') There are numerous smaller anthologies available&lt;ref group=note&gt;For instance, the ''Festal Menaion'' contains only those portions of the ''Menaion'' that have to do with the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]]; and the ''General Menaion'', et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt; which were quite common before the invention of printing but still are in common use both because of the enormous volume of a full set of liturgical texts and because the full texts have not yet been translated into several languages currently in use.
* '''[[Typicon]]''' (Greek: ''Τυπικόν, Typikon''; Slavonic: ''Тѵпико́нъ, Typikon'' or ''уста́въ, ustav'') Contains all of the rules for the performance of the Divine Services, giving directions for every possible combination of the materials from the books mentioned above into the Daily Cycle of Services.

===Liturgical cycles===&lt;!-- a link from the article [[Liturgical year]] points here --&gt;
Various cycles of the liturgical year influence the manner in which the materials from the liturgical books (above) are inserted into the daily services:

==== Weekly Cycle ====
Each day of the week has its own commemoration:
* ''Sunday''—[[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]]
* ''Monday''—The Holy [[Angels]]
* ''Tuesday''—St. [[John the Baptist|John the Forerunner]]
* ''Wednesday''—The [[Christian cross|Cross]] and the [[Theotokos]]
* ''Thursday''—The Holy [[Apostles]] and [[St. Nicholas]]
* ''Friday''—The Cross
* ''Saturday''—[[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Including, especially, the [[Theotokos]] and the [[Patron Saint]] of the local [[church (building)|church]] or [[monastery]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the departed

Most of the texts come from the ''Octoechos'', which has a large collections of hymns for each weekday for each of the eight tones; during great lent and, to a lesser degree, the pre-lenten season, the ''Lenten Triodion'' supplements this with hymns for each day of the week for each week of that season, as does the ''Pentecostarion'' during the pascal season.  Also, there are fixed texts for each day of the week are in the ''Horologion'' and ''Priest's Service Book'' (e.g., [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissals]]) and the [[Kathisma]]ta (selections from the ''Psalter'') are governed by the weekly cycle in conjunction with the season.

==== Fixed Cycle ====
Commemorations on the [[Fixed Cycle]] depend upon the day of the calendar year, and also, occasionally, specific days of the week that fall near specific calendar dates, e.g., the Sunday before the [[Exaltation of the Cross]]. The texts for this cycle are found in the ''Menaion''.

==== Paschal Cycle ====
The commemorations on the [[Paschal Cycle]] (Moveable Cycle) depend upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha (Easter)]]. The texts for this cycle are found in the ''Lenten Triodion'', the ''Pentecostarion'', the ''Octoechos'' and also, because the daily Epistle and Gospel readings are determined by this cycle, the ''Gospel Book'' and ''Apostle Book''.  The cycle of the ''Octoechos'' continues through the following great lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year's and the current year's dates of Easter.

===== 8 Week Cycle of the Octoechos =====
The cycle of the [[Octoechos|eight Tones]] is found in the ''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]'' and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the [[Thomas Sunday#Eastern churches|Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter]], that week using the first [[echos|tone]], the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent [[Palm Sunday]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Each day of [[Bright Week]] (Easter Week) uses propers in a different tone, Sunday: Tone One, Monday: Tone Two, skipping the [[grave tone]] (Tone Seven)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 11 Week Cycle of the Matins Gospels =====
The portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day's [[Matins Gospel]].

=== Daily cycle of services ===
The Daily Cycle begins with [[Vespers]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;In accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:

|}

The '''[[Typica]]''' is served whenever the [[Divine Liturgy]] is not celebrated at its usual time, i.e., when there is a vesperal Liturgy or no Liturgy at all. On days when the Liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the Typica follows the sixth hour (or Matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Typica has a certain correspondence to the [[Missa Sicca]] of the Mediaeval West.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; otherwise, on [[aliturgical days]] or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolof, p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there are [[Inter-Hours]] for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces "God is the Lord" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the [[ecclesiarch]] when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.

In addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, [[canon (hymnography)|canons]]) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].

The full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other [[Katholikon|katholika]]. In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation)]]; otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]] commencing straightway after the [[troparion]] following the [[Great Doxology]].

The [[Midnight Office]] is seldom served in parishes churches except at the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] as the essential office wherein the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|burial shroud]] is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.

===Aggregates===&lt;!-- [[Aggregate (liturgy)]] redirects here --&gt;
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates&lt;ref&gt;Sokolof, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is to conform with Psalm 55:17, "Evening, morning, and noonday will I tell of it and will declare it, and He will hear my voice."&lt;/ref&gt; The most common groupings are as follows:

==== Ordinary days ====
* Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline&lt;ref group=note&gt;In monasteries, when there is an evening meal, compline is often separated from vespers and read after the meal; in Greek (απόδειπνον/''apodeipnon'') and Slavonic (Повечерiе/''Pov'echeriye''), the name for Compline literally means, "After-supper."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Midnight Office is often omitted in parish churches.&lt;/ref&gt; Matins, First Hour
* Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Typica]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Though the Liturgy (and Typica) are not, strictly speaking, a part of the daily cycle of services, their placement is fixed by the Typicon in relation to the daily cycle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Weekdays during lent ====
* Evening — Great Compline
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
* Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, [[Typica]], Vespers (sometimes with the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)

==== When there is an all-night vigil ====
On the eves before [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used.  However, the [[all-night vigil]] is usually abridged so as to not last literally "all-night" and may be as short as two hours; on the other hand, on Athos and in the very traditional monastic institutions, that service followed by the  hours and Liturgy may last as long as 18 hours.
* Afternoon — Ninth Hour, Little Vespers,&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is an abbreviated, redundant Vespers&lt;/ref&gt; Compline (where it is not read at the commencement of the Vigil)
* Early night — Compline (where it is not the custom for it to follow small vespers), Great Vespers,&lt;ref group=note&gt;On great feast days proceeded by a strict fast (Christmas, Epiphany, and Annunciation on a weekday), the Vigil commences with Great Compline rather than Vespers&lt;/ref&gt; a reading, Matins, First Hour

==== When the royal hours are read ====
* Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins
* Morning — First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Hours and the Typica

==== On the eves of Christmas, Theophany, and Annunciation ====
When the feast is a weekday (or, in the Russian tradition, on any day for Christmas, Theophany), Vespers (with the Liturgy in most instances) is served earlier in the day and so Great Compline functions much as Great vespers does on the vigils of other feast days.
* Evening — Great Compline (in some traditions) and, if there be an All-Night Vigil, the reading, matins, first hour.
* Morning Watches — (unless there be an all-night vigil) midnight office, matins, first hour.

== Alexandrian Rite ==
The [[Alexandrian Rite]] is observed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]]. The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine ''Horologion'' is the [[Agpeya]].

Seven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional "Prayer of the Veil" which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine [[Midnight Office]]).

The hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:
* '''"Midnight Praise"''' (said in the early morning before dawn) commemorates the Second Coming of Christ. It consists of three watches, corresponding to the three stages of Christ's [[Agony in the Garden|prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane]] ( {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1–13}} ).
* '''Prime''' (dawn) is said upon waking in the morning or after the Midnight Praise the previous night. Associated with the Eternity of God, the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.
* '''Terce''' (9 a.m.) commemorates Christ's [[Pilate's court|trial before Pilate]], the descent of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].
* '''Sext''' (noon) commemorates the Passion of Christ.
:Terce and Sext are prayed before each Divine Liturgy.
* '''None''' (3 p.m.) commemorates the death of Christ on the Cross. This hour is also read during fasting days.
* '''Vespers''' (sunset) commemorates the taking down of Christ from the Cross.
* '''Compline''' (9 p.m. – before bedtime) commemorates the burial of Christ, the Final Judgment.
:Vespers and Compline are both read before the Liturgy during Lent and the [[Fast of Nineveh]].
* The '''Veil''' is reserved for bishops, priests and monks, as an examination of conscience.

Every one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:
* Introduction, which includes the Lord’s Prayer
* Prayer of Thanksgiving
* Psalm 50 (LXX).
* Various Psalms
* An excerpt from the Holy Gospel
* Short Litanies
* Some prayers (Only during Prime and Compline)
* Lord Have Mercy is then chanted 41 times (representing the 39 lashes Christ received before the crucifixion, plus one for the spear in His side, plus one for the crown of thorns)
* Prayer of "Holy Holy Holy..." and Lord's Prayer
* Prayer of Absolution
* Prayer of Every Hour

== East Syriac Rite ==
The [[East Syriac Rite]] (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]]. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning), with a rarely used Compline. When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three ''hulali'' (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.

The present arrangement provides for seven ''hulali'' at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on "Memorials", and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a ''Shuraya'', or short psalm, with generally a portion of [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]], varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1–6, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and "Memorials" Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1–18, comes at the end of the psalms.

The rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (''giyura'') inserted—like the Greek [[stichera]], but more extensively—between verses of psalms. On Sundays the [[Gloria in Excelsis]] and [[Benedicte (prayer)|Benedicte]] are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (''Khuthama'', "Sealing" ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.

The variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called "Before" (''Qdham'') and "After" (''Wathar''), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called ''Qdham u wathar'', or at full length ''Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar'', the "Book of Before and After".

The East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called ''Shawu'i''; these are Advent (called ''Subara'', "Annunciation"), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, "Elias and the Cross", "Moses", and the "Dedication" (''Qudash idta''). "Moses" and the "Dedication" have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the ''Shawu'a'' in which they occur, "Fourth Sunday of Epiphany", "Second Sunday of the Annunciation ", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a ''Shawu'a''. Most of the "Memorials" (''dukhrani''), or saints' days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as [[Christmas]], [[Theophany]], the [[Dormition]], and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.

There are four shorter fasting periods besides the [[Great Lent]]; these are:
* the ''Fast of Mar Zaya'' (three days after the second Sunday of the Nativity)
* the ''Fast of the Virgins'' (after the first Sunday of the Epiphany)
* the ''Fast of the Ninevites'' (seventy days before Easter)
* the ''Fast of Mart Mariam'' (Our Lady) (from the first to the fourteenth of August)

The Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the Chaldean Catholics. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the [[Julian Calendar]] is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the [[Seleucid era]] (year 1 = 311 B.C.).

== West Syriac Rite ==
The [[West Syriac Rite]], used in [[Syria]] by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] (Jacobites) and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Rite Catholic]] is in its origin simply the old rite of [[Antioch]] in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]], before the influence of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.

In accordance with [[Psalm 119]]:164, "Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 119:164&lt;/ref&gt; the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:
* '''Evening''' or ''Ramsho'' prayer (Vespers)
* '''Drawing of the Veil''' or ''Sootoro'', meaning "Protection", from Psalm 91, which is sung at this prayer, "He who sits under the protection of the Most High" (Compline)
* '''Midnight''' or ''Lilyo'' prayer (Matins)
* '''Morning''' or ''Saphro'' prayer (Prime, 6 a.m.)
* '''Third Hour''' or ''Tloth sho`in'' prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)
* '''Sixth Hour''' or ''Sheth sho`in'' prayer (Sext, noon)
* '''Ninth Hour''' or ''Tsha` sho`in'' prayer (None, 3 p.m.)

The Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three ''qawme'' or "watches" (literally "standings"). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (''Ramsho''). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.

The Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the ''Shhimo'', "simple prayer." The ''shhimo'' has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a ''qawmo'', a set of prayers that includes the [[Lord's Prayer]]. At the end of the office, the [[Nicene Creed]] is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|odes]].

== Armenian Rite ==
The Daily Services in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.

The '''Night Service''' (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Father]]. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.

The '''Morning Service''' (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Son]]. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the [[Myrrh-bearing Women]].

The '''Sunrise Service''' (6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.)&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally, the Sunrise Service was joined to the Morning Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to the praising of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.

The '''Third Hour''' (9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve’s original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.

The '''Sixth Hour''' (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ's Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God's help towards feeble human nature.

The '''Ninth Hour''' (3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.

The '''Evening Service''' (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.

The '''Peace Service''' (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ's descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.

The '''Rest Service''' (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.

In ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:
* In the morning: Night and Morning Services together
* In the evening: Evening Service

During [[Great Lent]], all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:
* In the morning: Night, Morning and Sunrise Services
* In the afternoon: Third, Sixth, Ninth Hours
* In the evening:
** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: Peace Service
** Wednesday, Friday: Rest Service
** Saturday, Sunday: Evening Service

The book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of [[Armenian chant|Armenian liturgical chant]] is the ''Sharagnots'' (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Armenian Usage|Armenian Octoechos]]), a collection of hymns known as ''Sharakan''. Originally, these hymns were [[Psalms]] and biblical [[Canticle]]s that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called ''ganonaklookh'' (Canon head).

== Anglican usage ==
{{details|Book of Common Prayer}}
[[File:Anglican Breviary.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Anglican Rosary]] sitting atop [[Anglican Breviary|The Anglican Breviary]] and [[The Book of Common Prayer]]]]
The [[Book of Common Prayer]], first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for [[Anglicans]] and [[Anglican Use]] Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (often called Mattins or Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (colloquially known as Evensong).

Since the early 20th century, revised editions of the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and [[Compline]]. The proposed Book of Common Prayer (1928) of the [[Church of England]] also restored the office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], although it has only appeared in the 1965 prayer book oh the [[Church of Melanesia]]. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:
* [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], corresponding to [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]].
* [[Prayer During the Day]], conflating the lesser hours of [[Terce]], [[Sext]], and [[None (liturgy)|None]].
* [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], corresponding to [[Vespers]].
* [[Compline|Night Prayer, or Compline]].
Some prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. also provides an "Order of Worship for the Evening" as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the [[Phos Hilaron]]. In the [[Church of England]], the publication in 2005 of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of [[Common Worship]], adds "Prayer During the Day" to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the [[Church Year]]. The 1989 New Zealand Prayer Book provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as "Midday Prayer," "Night Prayer," and "Family Prayer."

In 1995, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] published the ''Contemporary Office Book'' in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.

The traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], to return to the office's older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he eliminated the lesser hours and conflated the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, incorporating the canticles associated with each: the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] and  [[Te Deum]]. Similarly, Evening Prayer incorporated both the [[Magnificat]] from Vespers and the [[Nunc Dimittis]] from Compline. In Cranmer's design, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. This parallelism of two readings, each followed by a canticle, is a distinctive feature of the Anglican daily office. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated [[responsory|responsories]] and [[antiphon]]s, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books.

Like many other Reformers, Cranmer sought to restore the daily reading or singing of psalms as the heart of Christian daily prayer. Since his time, every edition of the Book of Common Prayer has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of [[Anglican Chant]] settings for the psalms and canticles.

The daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern.

While Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the [[eucharist]] has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.

Most Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the Book of Common Prayer or on Common Worship but with additional antiphons and devotions. The [[Order of the Holy Cross]] and [[Order of St. Helena]] published ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the ''St. Helena Breviary'' (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The [[All Saints Sisters of the Poor]] also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes ''Celebrating Common Prayer'', which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.

Some [[Anglo-Catholics]] use the [[Anglican Breviary]], an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the [[Sarum Rite]] in the style of Cranmer's original Book of Common Prayer, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], which was bound along with many editions of the ''Breviarium Romanum''. Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic ''Liturgy of the Hours'' (US) or ''Divine Office'' (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas' translation of the 'Monastic Diurnal' into the idiom of the 'Book of Common Prayer'. Former Anglicans worshiping in [[Roman Catholic]] parishes of the [[Pastoral Provision]] and the [[Personal Ordinariates]] maintain the Anglican flavor of the Daily Office using the [[Book of Divine Worship]], an adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer approved for [[Anglican Use]] Catholics in 2003.

Historically, Anglican clergy have vested in [[cassock]], [[surplice]] and [[tippet]] for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the [[rochet]] and [[chimere]]. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or [[alb]], stole and [[cope]] when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.

The canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, "Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister."&lt;ref&gt;Canon C.24&lt;/ref&gt; Canon C.26 stipulates that "Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer...."&lt;ref&gt;Canon C.26&lt;/ref&gt; In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.

== Methodist usage ==
[[File:Methodist canonical hours.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Lukan Book of Hours (in purple) and The Book of Offices and Services (in red), both liturgical texts of [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]], a Methodist religious order]]
F. W. Macdonald, the biographer of [[John Fletcher Hurst|The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst]], stated that Oxford Methodism "with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England".&lt;ref name="Hurst1902"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=The History of Methodism|year=1902|publisher=Eaton &amp; Mains|pages=310–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists'', which was written by [[John Wesley]] himself. It was consequently updated in the ''Book of Offices'', published in 1936 in Great Britain, and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]'', published in 1992 in the United States.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|first=Paul F.|title=New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship|date=April 2013|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=978-0-334-04932-6|page=82|quote=The Church in 1935 approved ''Divine Worship'' (versions of morning prayer, other services and numerous collects) and in 1936 authorized the ''Book of Offices'' and, bound in with it, the ''Order for Morning Prayer'': both still exhibited connections to the ''BCP'' and thus Wesley's orders, though the former showed a willingness to include newly composed prayers and those borrowed from other Free Church sources.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, ''The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke'' contains [[Lauds|Morning]], [[Terce|Mid-Morning]], [[Sext|Noon]], [[Nones (liturgy)|Mid-Afternoon]], [[Vespers|Evening]], [[Compline]] and [[Vigil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Offices and Services|date=6 September 2012|publisher=[[Order of St. Luke]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liberal Catholic usage ==
The [[Liberal Catholic Church]], and many groups in the [[Liberal Catholic movement]], also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,'' the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Complin.
Its recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.

A pew edition of the Hours was published in 2002 by St. Alban's Press. However, the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church'' also includes the Hours for recitation.

== Reformed and Lutheran usage ==
Some Reformed churches—notably the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]—have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of [[inclusive language]].

''The New Century Psalter'', published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.

''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'', published in 1994 by [[Westminster John Knox Press]], includes the daily offices from [[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]], the liturgy of the [[Presbyterian Church USA]]. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter—an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American [[Book of Common Prayer]]—also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year.

Both books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.

Lutheran worship books usually include orders for Morning and Evening Prayer as well as Compline. Liturgies published by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In recent years, under the impact of the liturgical movement, Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' published by the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] as well as the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.

A '''declaration of faith''' is a phrase that is said by a member of any [[religion]] to show either to themselves, their [[God]] or other members of the religion their belief and faith in the religion. Notable declarations of faith include the [[Sign of the Cross]] in [[Christianity]], the [[Shahadah]] in [[Islam]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] in [[Judaism]].

There are numerous other declarations of faith, typically performed during religious rituals in many faiths. Often, the declaration of faith is led by the leader of the congregation and followers respond in kind.

The [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] significance of entheogens is well established in anthropological and modern contexts; entheogens have traditionally been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], including [[White magic|white]] and [[black magic]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[divinatory]], [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[prayer]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[chanting]], [[hymn]]s like [[peyote song]]s, and [[Drum circle|drumming]].  In the 1960s the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]] escalated its use to [[psychedelic art]], [[binaural beats]], [[sensory deprivation tank]]s, [[psychedelic music|music]], and [[rave|rave parties]].

==Etymology==

The [[neologism]] ''entheogen'' was coined in 1979 by a group of [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanists]] and scholars of [[mythology]] ([[Carl A. P. Ruck]], Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, [[Richard Evans Schultes]], [[Jonathan Ott]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]]). The term is derived from two words of [[Ancient Greek]], ἔνθεος (''éntheos'') and γενέσθαι (''genésthai''). The adjective ''entheos'' translates to English as "full of the god, inspired, possessed", and is the root of the English word "[[enthusiasm]]." The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. ''Genesthai'' means "to come into being." Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or "spiritual" manner.&lt;ref name=Godlaski2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Godlaski, Theodore M |title=The God within |journal=Substance Use and Misuse |year=2011 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=1217–1222 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2011.561722 |pmid=21692597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entheogen was coined as a replacement for the terms ''hallucinogen'' and ''[[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]''. ''Hallucinogen'' was popularized by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiences with [[mescaline]], which were published as ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' in 1954. ''Psychedelic'', in contrast, is a Greek neologism for "mind manifest", and was coined by psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]]; Huxley was a volunteer in experiments Osmond was conducting on mescaline.

Ruck et al. argued that the term ''hallucinogen'' was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and [[insanity]]. The term ''psychedelic'' was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words pertaining to [[psychosis]] and also due to the fact that it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of 1960s [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In modern usage ''entheogen'' may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with [[recreational drug use|recreational use]] of the same drugs. The meanings of the term ''entheogen'' were formally defined by Ruck et al.:

{{quote|In a strict sense, only those vision-producing drugs that can be shown to have figured in shamanic or religious rites would be designated entheogens, but in a looser sense, the term could also be applied to other drugs, both natural and artificial, that induce alterations of consciousness similar to those documented for ritual ingestion of traditional entheogens.|Ruck et al, 1979, ''Journal of Psychedelic Drugs''&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Entheogens have been used by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Some countries have legislation that allows for traditional entheogen use. However, in the mid-20th century, after the [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|discovery]] of LSD, and the intervention of [[psychedelic therapy]], the term ''entheogen'', invented in 1979, later became an umbrella term used to include artificial drugs, [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] treatment, and spiritual practices, whether or not in a formal religious or traditional structure.

[[R. Gordon Wasson]] and [[Giorgio Samorini]] have proposed several examples of the cultural use of entheogens that are found in the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Giorgio |last1=Samorini |title=The 'Mushroom-Tree' of Plaincourault |journal=Eleusis |issue=8 |year=1997 |pages=29–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Giorgio |last1=Samorini |title=The 'Mushroom-Trees' in Christian Art |journal=Eleusis |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=87–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]] suggest early ceremonial practices by the [[Scythians]] occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BC, confirming previous historical reports by [[Herodotus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882553191|title=The Amazons : lives and legends of warrior women across the ancient world|last=1946-|first=Mayor, Adrienne,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780691147208|location=Princeton|pages=147–149|oclc=882553191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s – present===
[[File:Synthetic mescaline powder i2001e0151 ccby3.jpg|right|thumb|Laboratory synthetic [[mescaline]]. Mescaline was the first (1887) [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compound to be extracted and isolated from nature (from peyote).&lt;ref&gt;http://mescaline.com/exp/&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There now exist many [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] drugs with similar psychoactive properties, many derived from the aforementioned plants. Many pure [[active compound]]s with psychoactive properties have been isolated from these respective organisms and chemically synthesized, including [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], [[salvinorin A]], [[ibogaine]], [[ergine]], and [[muscimol]].

Semi-synthetic (e.g., [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]) and synthetic drugs (e.g., [[Dipropyltryptamine|DPT]] and [[2C-B]] used by the [[Sangoma]]) have also been developed. Alexander Shulgin developed hundreds of entheogens in [[PiHKAL]]  and [[TiHKAL]]. Most of the drugs in PiHKAL are synthetic.

====Religious movements====
Entheogens used by movements includes biotas like [[peyote]] ([[Native American Church]]), extracts like [[Ayahuasca]] ([[Santo Daime]], [[União do Vegetal]]), the semi-synthetic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] ([[Neo-American Church]]), and synthetic drugs like [[Dipropyltryptamine|DPT]] ([[Temple of the True Inner Light]]) and [[2C-B]] ([[Sangoma]]&lt;ref name="2cb-Sangoma-evolver"&gt;{{cite web |title=2CB chosen over traditional entheogens by South African healers |url=http://evolver.civicactions.net/user/chen_cho_dorge/blog/2cb_chosen_over_traditional_entheogens_south_african_healers |author=Chen Cho Dorge |publisher=Evolver.net |date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.

[[Image:2cb pill.jpg|thumb|right|[[2C-B]] is an [[entactogen]] commonly used at public places, like rave parties.]]

====Psychedelic therapy====
Psychedelic therapy refers to therapeutic practices involving the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline, and 2C-i, primarily to assist [[psychotherapy]].

[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|MAPS]] has pursued a number of other research studies examining the effects of psychedelics administered to human subjects. These studies include, but are not limited to, studies of Ayahuasca, DMT, ibogaine, ketamine, LSA, LSD, [[Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine|MDE]], MDMA, mescaline, peyote, psilocybin, ''Salvia divinorum'' and conducted multi-drug studies as well as cross cultural and meta-analysis research.&lt;ref name="maps-research"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/research/ |title=Psychedelic Research Around the World |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===

====Ancient religions====
[[File:Michelangelo Bacchus.jpg|200px|thumb|right| [[Dionysos]], or Bacchus, was known as the [[God (male deity)|god]] of wine and ritual madness in [[Greek mythology]] ([[Bacchus (Michelangelo)|''Bacchus'']] by [[Michelangelo]] 1497).]]
{{Main|Drinking culture|religion and alcohol}}
Alcohol has sometimes been invested with [[Religion|religious]] significance.

; Celtic polytheism

In [[Celtic polytheism|ancient Celtic religion]], [[Sucellus]] or Sucellos was the [[god]] of [[agriculture]], [[forest]]s and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]] of the Gauls.

; Ancient Mesopotamian religion

[[Ninkasi]] is the ancient [[Sumer]]ian [[Patron god|tutelary goddess]] of [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerchurch.com/beer-info/beer-history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629064244/http://www.beerchurch.com/beer-info/beer-history/ |archivedate=29 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Dionysian Mysteries

In the ancient [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greco-Roman religion]], [[Dionysus|Dionysos]] (or Bacchus) was the [[God (male deity)|god]] of the grape harvest, [[winemaking]] and [[wine]], of ritual madness and [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], of merry making and [[Bread and circuses|theatre]]. The original rite of Dionysus is associated with a wine cult and he may have been worshipped as early as c. 1500–1100 BC by [[Mycenean Greeks]]. The [[Dionysian Mysteries]] were a [[ritual]] of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] which used [[intoxicant]]s and other trance-inducing techniques (like dance and music) to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. In his Laws, [[Plato]] said that alcoholic drinking parties should be the basis of any educational system, because the alcohol allows relaxation of otherwise fixed views. ''[[The Symposium]]'' (literally, 'drinking together') was a dramatised account of a drinking party where the participants debated the nature of love.

In the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], a cup of wine is offered to Demeter which she refuses, instead insisting upon a potion of barley, water, and glechon, known as the ceremonial drink Kykeon, an essential part of the Mysteries.  The potion has been hypothesized to be an ergot derivative from barley, similar to [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries'', by [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Albert Hofmann]], and [[Carl A. P. Ruck]].{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Osiris

Egyptian pictographs clearly show wine as a finished product around 4000 BC. Osiris, the god who invented beer and brewing, was worshiped throughout the country. The ancient Egyptians made at least 24 types of wine and 17 types of beer. These beverages were used for pleasure, nutrition, rituals, medicine, and payments. They were also stored in the tombs of the deceased for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://invent.answers.com/history/the-history-of-alcohol |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100318/http://invent.answers.com/history/the-history-of-alcohol |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osiris|Osirian Mysteries]] paralleled the Dionysian, according to contemporary Greek and Egyptian observers. [[Spirit possession]] involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints. It celebrated that which was outside civilized society and a return to the source of being, which would later assume mystical overtones. It also involved escape from the socialized personality and ego into an ecstatic, deified state or the primal herd (sometimes both).

; Paganism

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2014}} have postulated that [[paganism|pagan]] religions actively promoted alcohol and [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] as a means of fostering [[fertility]]. Alcohol was believed to increase sexual desire and make it easier to approach another person for [[Alcohol and sex|sex]].

; Christianity

Many [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]] use wine in the [[Eucharist]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Communion]] and permit alcohol consumption in moderation. Other denominations use unfermented grape juice in Communion; they either voluntarily abstain from alcohol or prohibit it outright.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

; Judaism

[[Judaism]] uses wine on [[Shabbat]] and some [[Jewish holidays|holidays]] for [[Kiddush]] as well as more extensively in the [[Passover]] ceremony and other religious ceremonies. The secular consumption of alcohol is allowed. Some [[Jew]]ish texts, e.g., the [[Talmud]], encourage moderate drinking on holidays (such as [[Purim]]) in order to make the occasion more joyous.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

; Bahá'í Faith
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

Entheogens have been used by individuals to pursue spiritual goals such as [[divination]], [[ego death]], [[egolessness]], [[faith healing]], [[psychedelic therapy]] and [[spiritual formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I Do Psychedelics|url=http://www.jonathontwiz.com/2015/01/24/why-i-do-psychedelics/|publisher=www.jonathontwiz.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Black magic ====
{{main|Black magic#Shamanism}}

In some areas, there are purported [[malevolent sorcerer]]s who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.&lt;ref name="Campos 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms|last=Campos|first=Don Jose|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peyotism ====
[[File:Peyote Drummer.jpg|thumb|right|A Native American Peyote Drummer (c. 1927)]]

The [[Native American Church]] (NAC) is also known as ''Peyotism'' and ''Peyote Religion''. Peyotism is a [[Native American religion]] characterized by mixed traditional as well as [[Protestant]] beliefs and by sacramental use of the entheogen [[peyote]].

The Peyote Way Church of God believe that "Peyote is a holy sacrament, when taken according to our sacramental procedure and combined with a holistic lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peyoteway.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prohibition ====
Some religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These include [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], [[Theravada]], most [[Mahayana]] schools of [[Buddhism]], some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of [[Christianity]], some sects of [[Taoism]] ([[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]] and [[Ten Precepts (Taoism)|Ten Precepts]]), and [[Hinduism]].

The [[Pali Canon]], the scripture of [[Theravada Buddhism]], depicts refraining from alcohol as essential to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]. The fifth of the [[Five Precepts]] states, "''Surā-meraya-majja-pamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''" In English: "I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication." Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does also not even include light to moderate drinking, only to the point of drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or mild coffee) that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== Judaism and Christianity ====
Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. The early history of the Church, however, was filled with a variety of drug use, recreational and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;The Chemical Muse: Drug Use and the Roots of Western Civilization by D. C.A. Hillman Ph.D.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]], also called [[Sara Benetowa]], a Polish anthropologist, who claimed in 1967 that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church confirmed it as a possible valid interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Marijuana and the Bible= Erowid.org|date=2002-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneh-bosm is listed as an incense in the [[Old Testament]].

Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] (founder of [[Jewish Renewal]]) and [[Richard Alpert]] (later known as Ram Dass) were influential early Jewish explorers of the connections between hallucinogenics and spirituality, from the early 1960s onwards.

It is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]] that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001){{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000){{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merlin|first=M. D.|title=COVER ARTICLE: Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World|journal=Economic Botany|volume=57|issue=3|pages=295–323|doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0295:AEFTTO]2.0.CO;2|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Living Torah]]'', cannabis may have been one of the ingredients of the [[holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Aryeh. (1981). ''The Living Torah'' New York. p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosm'' (Hebrew: קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם). This is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, [[Religious use of incense|incense]], and an ingredient in holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Although Chris Bennett's research in this area focuses on cannabis, he mentions evidence suggesting use of additional visionary plants such as henbane, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1550567985 Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible], by Chris Bennett and Neil McQueen, 2001, Forbidden Fruit Publishing.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]] translates ''kaneh-bosm'' as [[Sweet flag|calamus]], and this translation has been propagated unchanged to most later translations of the old testament. However, [[Poland|Polish]] anthropologist [[Sula Benet]] published [[etymology|etymological]] arguments that the [[Aramaic]] word for hemp can be read as ''kannabos'' and appears to be a [[cognate]] to the modern word 'cannabis',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.njweedman.com/kanehbosm.html |title=kanehbosm |publisher=Njweedman.com |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the root ''kan'' meaning reed or hemp and ''bosm'' meaning fragrant. Both cannabis and calamus are fragrant, reedlike plants containing [[psychotropic]] compounds.

In his research, Professor [[Dan Merkur]] points to significant evidence of an awareness within the Jewish mystical tradition recognizing [[manna]] as an entheogen, thereby substantiating with [[rabbinic]] texts theories advanced by the superficial biblical interpretations of [[Terence McKenna]], [[R. Gordon Wasson]] and other [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]].

Although [[philologist]] [[John Marco Allegro]] has suggested that the self-revelation and healing abilities attributed to the figure of Jesus may have been associated with the effects of the plant medicines, this evidence is dependent on pre-[[Septuagint]] interpretation of Torah and [[Tenach]].  Allegro was the only non-Catholic appointed to the position of translating the Dead Sea scrolls. His extrapolations are often the object of scorn due to Allegro's non-mainstream theory of Jesus as a mythological personification of the essence of a "psychoactive sacrament".  Furthermore, they conflict with the position of the Catholic Church with regard to [[transubstantiation]] and the teaching involving valid matter, form, and drug — that of bread and wine (bread does not contain psychoactive drugs, but wine contains [[ethanol]]). Allegro's book [[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]] relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro believed he could prove, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], as of many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting visionary plants (or "[[psychedelics]]") to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the Plaincourault chapel's fresco to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the Eucharist.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The historical picture portrayed by the Entheos journal is of fairly widespread use of visionary plants in early Christianity and the surrounding culture, with a gradual reduction of use of entheogens in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entheomedia.org/Issue%20one.htm Conjuring Eden: Art and the Entheogenic Vision of Paradise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814121831/http://www.entheomedia.org/Issue%20one.htm |date=14 August 2007 }}, by Mark Hoffman, Carl Ruck, and Blaise Staples. Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Issue No. 1, Summer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; R. Gordon Wasson's book ''Soma'' prints a letter from art historian Erwin Panofsky asserting that art scholars are aware of many "mushroom trees" in Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814053612/http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm |date=14 August 2007 }}, Michael S. Hoffman, Journal of Higher Criticism, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the extent of visionary plant use throughout the history of Christian practice has barely been considered yet by academic or independent scholars. The question of whether visionary plants were used in pre-Theodosius Christianity is distinct from evidence that indicates the extent to which visionary plants were utilized or forgotten in later Christianity, including heretical or quasi- Christian groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://entheomedia.org/Entheos_Issue_2.htm Daturas for the Virgin], José Celdrán and Carl Ruck, Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Vol. I, Issue 2, Winter, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of other groups such as elites or laity within orthodox Catholic practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594601445 The Hidden World: Survival of Pagan Shamanic Themes in European Fairytales], by Carl Ruck, Blaise Staples, Jose Alfredo Celdran, Mark Hoffman, Carolina Academic Press, 2007{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Merkur at the [[University of Toronto]] contends that a minority of Christian hermits and mystics could possibly have used entheogens, in conjunction with [[fasting]], [[meditation]], and [[prayer]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

According to R.C. Parker, "The use of entheogens in the [[Vajrayana]] tradition has been documented by such scholars as Ronald M Davidson, William George Stablein, Bulcsu Siklos, David B. Gray, Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, Shashibhusan Das Gupta, Francesca Fremantle, Shinichi Tsuda, David Gordon White, Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, James Francis Hartzell, Edward Todd Fenner, Ian Baker, Dr. Pasang Yonten Arya and numerous others." These scholars have established entheogens were used in Vajrayana (in a limited context) as well as in Tantric [[Saivite]] traditions. The major entheogens in the Vajrayana [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] tradition are [[cannabis]] and ''[[Datura]]'' which were used in various pills, ointments, and elixirs. Several tantras within Vajrayana specifically mention these entheogens and their use, including the Laghusamvara-tantra (aka [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]), Samputa-tantra, Samvarodaya-tantra, Mahakala-tantra, Guhyasamaja-tantra, Vajramahabhairava-tantra, and the Krsnayamari-tantra.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;Parker, R.C.

Gray, The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Śrī Heruka): A Study and Annotated Translation.]{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed by Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein that the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom was used by the Tantric Buddhist [[mahasiddha]] tradition of the 8th to 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hajicek-Dobberstein; Soma siddhas and alchemical enlightenment: psychedelic

In the West, some modern Buddhist teachers have written on the usefulness of psychedelics. The Buddhist magazine [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]] devoted their entire fall 1996 edition to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Tricycle: Buddhism &amp; Psychedelics, Fall 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers such as [[Jack Kornfield]] have acknowledged the possibility that psychedelics could complement Buddhist practice, bring healing and help people understand their connection with everything which could lead to compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Kornfield, Jack; "Bringing Home the Dharma: Awakening Right Where You Are", excerpted at {{cite web |url=http://www.jackkornfield.com/psychedelics-antidepressants-spiritual-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005190548/http://www.jackkornfield.com/psychedelics-antidepressants-spiritual-practice |archivedate=5 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Kornfield warns however that addiction can still be a hindrance. Other teachers such as Michelle McDonald-Smith expressed views which saw entheogens as not conductive to Buddhist practice ("I don't see them developing anything").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stolaroff |first1=M.

=== Cultural use ===

Entheogens have been used in various ways, e.g., as part of established religious rituals, as aids for personal spiritual development ("plant teachers"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175718/http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-09 |title=Entheogens &amp; education: Exploring the potential of psychoactives as educational tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Journal of Drug Education and Awareness |year=2003 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=145–161 |issn=1546-6965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229092745/http://csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-12-29 |title=Entheogens and existential intelligence: The use of plant teachers as cognitive tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Canadian Journal of Education |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=499–516 |doi=10.2307/1602247 |jstor=1602247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as recreational drugs, and for medical and therapeutic use.  The use of entheogens in human cultures is nearly ubiquitous throughout recorded history.

Naturally occurring entheogens such as [[psilocybin]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (in the preparation [[ayahuasca]]), were, for the most part, discovered and used by older cultures, as part of their spiritual and religious life, as plants and agents that were respected, or in some cases revered for generations and may be a tradition that predates all modern religions as a sort of proto-religious rite.

One of the most widely used entheogens is [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[entheogenic use of cannabis]] has been used in regions such as [[China]], [[Europe]], and [[India]], and, in some cases, for thousands of years. It has also appeared as a part of religions and cultures such as the [[Rastafari movement]], the [[Sadhus]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Scythians]], [[Sufi]] [[Islam]], and others.

==== Africa ====

The best-known entheogen-using culture of [[Africa]] is the [[Bwiti]]sts, who used a preparation of the root bark of ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html Bwiti: An Ethnography of the Religious Imagination in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628094315/http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html |date=28 June 2006 }} by James W. Fernandez, Princeton University Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ancient Egyptians may have been using the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]] plant in some of their religious rituals or just symbolically, it has been suggested that Egyptian religion once revolved around the ritualistic ingestion of the far more psychoactive ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushroom, and that the Egyptian [[White Crown]], Triple Crown, and [[Atef]] Crown were evidently designed to represent pin-stages of this mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://shroomer.cz/upload/Hubicky_v_Egypte.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222064142/http://shroomer.cz/upload/Hubicky_v_Egypte.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-22 |title=The entheomycological origin of Egyptian crowns and the esoteric underpinnings of Egyptian religion |author=S.R.

==== Americas ====
{{See also|Aztec use of entheogens|Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal}}

Entheogens have played a pivotal role in the spiritual practices of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the [[peyote]] cactus (''Lophophora williamsii''). For his part, one of the founders of modern ethno-botany, the late-[[Richard Evans Schultes]] of [[Harvard University]] documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the [[Kiowa]], who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now [[Mexico]], in the 19th century its use spread throughout [[North America]], replacing the deadly [[toxic]] [[Calia secundiflora|mescal bean]] (''Calia secundiflora'') who are questioned to be an entheogen at all. Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic [[Aztec]] sacrament, [[pulque]], ritual [[tobacco]] (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the [[Maya people|Maya]] (from where the word 'cigar' derives)), [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, morning glories (''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' and ''[[Turbina corymbosa]]''), and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.

Entheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the [[Rastafari movement]] and the [[Church of the Universe]].

''[[Datura wrightii]]'' is sacred to some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and has been used in ceremonies and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]] by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of ''momoy'' to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite book | author=Cecilia Garcia, James D. Adams | title=Healing with medicinal plants of the west - cultural and scientific basis for their use | publisher=Abedus Press| year=2005 | isbn=0-9763091-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Momoy'' was also used to enhance spiritual wellbeing among adults . For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of ''momoy'' was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.

==== Asia ====
The indigenous peoples of [[Siberia]] (from whom the term ''shaman'' was borrowed) have used ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as an entheogen.

In [[Hinduism]], ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong [[deliriants]], which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects.

Also, the ancient drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], mentioned often in the [[Vedas]], appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be [[ephedrine]], an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as ''[[Ephedra]] pachyclada''. However, there are also [[Botanical identity of soma–haoma|arguments]] to suggest that Soma could have also been [[Harmal|Syrian rue]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', or some combination of any of the above plants.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==== Europe ====

Fermented honey, known in Northern Europe as [[mead]], was an early entheogen in [[Aegean civilization]], predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn [[Dionysus]] and the [[maenad]]s. Its religious uses in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] world are bound up with the [[Bee (mythology)|mythology of the bee]].

[[Dacians]] were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by [[Herodotus]], were "''[[kap-no-batai]]''" which in Dacian was supposed to mean "the ones that walk in the clouds".

The growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the initiation ceremony for the cult of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]] involving the use of a drug known as [[kykeon]]. The term 'ambrosia' is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the ''Soma'' of the Hindus as well.

A theory that natural occurring gases like [[ethylene]] used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at [[Delphi]] in [[Classical Greece]] received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ethylene/ethylene_history1.shtml |title=History : Oracle at Delphi May Have Been Inhaling Ethylene Gas Fumes |work=Ethylene Vault |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to [[Mushroom picking in Slavic culture|Slavic and Baltic peoples]]. Some academics consider that using [[psilocybin]]- and or [[muscimol]]-containing mushrooms was an integral part of the ancient culture of the [[Rus' people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narkotiki.ru/research_5281.html|title=Drugs in ancient Russia - Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Middle East ====

It has been suggested that the ritual use of small amounts of [[Harmal|Syrian rue]] is an artifact of its ancient use in higher doses as an entheogen (possibly in conjunction with [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] containing acacia).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Philologist [[John Marco Allegro]] has argued in his book ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'' that early Jewish and Christian cultic practice was based on the use of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which was later forgotten by its adherents. Allegro's hypothesis is that Amanita use was sacred knowledge kept only by high figures to hide the true beginnings of the Christian cult, seems supported by his own view that the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] shows evidence of Christian amanita use in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;

==== Oceania ====

In general, [[indigenous Australians]] are thought not to have used entheogens, although there is a strong barrier of secrecy surrounding Aboriginal shamanism, which has likely limited what has been told to outsiders. A plant that the Australian Aboriginals used to ingest is called ''Pitcheri'', which is said to have a similar effect to that of coca.
''Pitcheri'' was made from the bark of the shrub ''[[Duboisia myoporoides]]''. This plant is now grown commercially and is processed to manufacture an eye medication.
There are no known uses of entheogens by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] aside from a variant species of kava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entheology.org/edoto/anmviewer.asp?a=67 |title=Macropiper Excelsum - Maori Kava |publisher=Entheology.org |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natives of [[Papua New Guinea]] are known to use several species of entheogenic mushrooms (''Psilocybe'' spp, ''Boletus manicus'').&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shaman-australis.com/~benjamin-thomas/ |title=Benjamin Thomas Ethnobotany &amp; Anthropology Research Page |publisher=Shaman-australis.com |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kava]] or ''kava kava'' (''Piper Methysticum'') has been cultivated for at least 3000 years by a number of Pacific island-dwelling peoples. Historically, most [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]], many [[Melanesian]], and some [[Micronesia]]n cultures have ingested the psychoactive pulverized root, typically taking it mixed with water.  In these traditions, taking kava is believed to facilitate contact with the spirits of the dead, especially relatives and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=edited by Yadhu N.|title=Kava from ethnology to pharmacology|year=2004|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420023373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Studies such as Timothy Leary's [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]] and Roland Griffiths' psilocybin studies at Johns Hopkins have documented reports of mystical/spiritual/religious experiences from participants who were administered psychoactive drugs in controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=MacLean, Katherine A.|author2=Johnson, Matthew W.|author3=Griffiths, Roland R.|title=Mystical Experiences Occasioned by the Hallucinogen Psilcybin Lead to Increases in the Personality Domain of Openness|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology|date=2011|volume=25|issue=11|pages=1453–1461|doi=10.1177/0269881111420188|pmid=21956378|pmc=3537171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research is limited due to widespread [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug prohibition]].

[[File:Marsh-chapel-window.jpg|thumb|[[Mandala]]-like [[Rose window|round window]] above the altar at [[Boston University]]'s Marsh Chapel, site of [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]]]]
Notable early testing of the entheogenic experience includes the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]], conducted by physician and theology doctoral candidate, [[Walter Pahnke]], under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. In this [[double-blind]] experiment, volunteer graduate school divinity students from the Boston area almost all claimed to have had profound religious experiences subsequent to the ingestion of pure [[psilocybin]]. In 2006, a more rigorously controlled experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and yielded similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance | journal = Psychopharmacology | date = 2006-07-07 | author = R.

Furthermore, scientific studies on entheogens present some significant challenges to investigators, including philosophical questions relating to [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Ayahuasca, Psychedelic Studies and Health Sciences: The Politics of Knowledge and Inquiry into an Amazonian Plant Brew|journal=Current Drug Abuse Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|pages=71–80|year=2014|accessdate=2015-01-12|url=http://eurekaselect.com/127467|doi=10.2174/1874473708666150107155042|pmid=25563448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==

===Australia===
{{main|Dimethyltryptamine#Australia}}

Between 2011 and 2012, the [[Australian Federal Government]] was considering changes to the [[Criminal law of Australia|Australian Criminal Code]] that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as "controlled plants".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Consultation on implementation of model drug schedules for Commonwealth serious drug offences|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_ConsultationonimplementationofmodeldrugschedulesforCommonwealthseriousdrugoffences|date=24 June 2010|publisher=[[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Australian Government, Attorney-General's Department]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107074102/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_ConsultationonimplementationofmodeldrugschedulesforCommonwealthseriousdrugoffences|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing Mescaline or Ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official [[List of Australian floral emblems|Floral Emblem of Australia]], [[Acacia pycnantha]] (Golden Wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious peoples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUSSIE DMT BAN|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/79564875/aussie-dmt-ban|publisher=connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1963 in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual's right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows:

For the individual, the court must determine
* whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and
* whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person's ability to act on that belief.

If these two elements are established, then the government must prove
* that it is acting in furtherance of a "[[compelling state interest]]," and
* that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion.

This test was eventually all-but-eliminated in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a "neutral law of general applicability" was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993.

In ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church's use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies.

Some states have enacted [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts]] intended to mirror the federal RFRA's protections.

====Religious discrimination====
[[Peyote]] is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.  However, practitioners of the [[Native American Church|Peyote Way Church of God]], a [[Native American religion]], perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as [[Religious discrimination in the United States#Peyote usage|discriminating]], leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of ''[[Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh]]'' the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978 was passed.  This federal statute allow the "Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament," exempting only use by Native American persons.

== Classical mythology and cults ==

Although entheogens are taboo and most of them are officially prohibited in Christian and Islamic societies, their ubiquity and prominence in the spiritual traditions of various other cultures is unquestioned. "The spirit, for example, need not be chemical, as is the case with the ivy and the olive: and yet the god was felt to be within them; nor need its possession be considered something detrimental, like drugged, hallucinatory, or delusionary: but possibly instead an invitation to knowledge or whatever good the god's spirit had to offer."&lt;ref name="Ruck and Staples"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staples|first=Danny|title=The world of classical myth : gods and goddesses, heroines and heroes|year=1994|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0-89089-575-9|url=http://csp.org/chrestomathy/world_of.html|author2=Carl A.P. Ruck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the well-known modern examples, such as [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and [[Ipomoea tricolor|morning glories]] are from the native cultures of the Americas. However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the "pressed juice" that is the subject of Book 9 of the [[Rig Veda]]. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the ''Rig Veda'' that embodies the nature of an entheogen:

{{quote|Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truth speaking, truthful in thy works, Enouncing faith, King Soma!... O [Soma] Pavāmana (mind clarifying), place me in that deathless, undecaying world wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.... Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where joy and felicities combine...}}

The [[kykeon]] that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Kerényi, in ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter.'' Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]], [[Datura stramonium|datura]], and the unidentified "lotus" (likely the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]]) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]''.

According to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] brought knowledge of was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered [[wine]], the entheogen of [[Dionysus]], who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]], when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks "recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the 'pressed juice' of Soma — but better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the [[Hyperborea]]ns: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable."&lt;ref name="Ruck and Staples" /&gt; [[Robert Graves]], in his foreword to ''The Greek Myths,'' hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-[[Greeks|Hellenic]] tribes was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps [[psilocybin mushroom]]s of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.

Amanita was [[divinity|divine]] food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in or sampled lightly, not something to be profaned. It was the food of the gods, their [[ambrosia]], and it mediated between the two realms. It is said that [[Tantalus]]'s crime was inviting commoners to share his [[ambrosia]].

The entheogen is believed to offer godlike powers in many traditional tales, including immortality. The failure of [[Gilgamesh]] in retrieving the plant of immortality from beneath the waters teaches that the blissful state cannot be taken by force or guile: When Gilgamesh lay on the bank, exhausted from his heroic effort, the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] came and ate the plant.

Another attempt at subverting the natural order is told in a (according to some) strangely metamorphosed myth, in which natural roles have been reversed to suit the Hellenic world-view. The Alexandrian Apollodorus relates how [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (spelled "Ge" in the following passage), Mother Earth herself, has supported the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] in their battle with the Olympian intruders. The Giants have been defeated:

{{quote|When Ge learned of this, she sought a drug that would prevent their destruction even by mortal hands. But Zeus barred the appearance of Eos (the Dawn), Selene (the Moon), and Helios (the Sun), and chopped up the drug himself before Ge could find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca|date=Circa 2 A.D.|pages=34–39|url=http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Gaia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Assassins===
{{main|Hashshashins#Legends and folklore}}

The legends of the [[Assassins]] had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries.

The tales of the ''fida'is''' training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a "secret garden of paradise".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken. Here, they were told by an old man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause.&lt;ref name="Secret Order"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = Marshall G.S. | authorlink1 = Marshall Hodgson | title = The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizârî Ismâʻîlîs Against the Islamic World | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2005 | location = Philadelphia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GU7uAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = September 15, 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1916-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; So went the tale of the "Old Man in the Mountain", assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] (1774–1856), a prominent orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

== Literature ==
Many works of literature have described entheogen use; some of those are:
* The drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] (spice) in [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] acts as both an entheogen (in large enough quantities) and an addictive [[geriatric]] medicine. Control of the supply of melange was crucial to the Empire, as it was necessary for, among other things, [[faster than light|faster-than-light]] (folding space) navigation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* Consumption of the imaginary [[mushroom]] ''anochi'' [enoki] as the entheogen underlying the creation of Christianity is the premise of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s last novel, ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]'', a theme that seems to be inspired by John Allegro's book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* Aldous Huxley's final novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), depicted a fictional [[psychoactive mushroom]] — termed "[[moksha]] medicine" — used by the people of Pala in rites of passage, such as the transition to adulthood and at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunesekera|first1=Romesh|title=Book Of A Lifetime: Island, By Aldous Huxley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-island-by-aldous-huxley-6295203.html|website=Independent UK|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2779438 | pmid=17486431 | doi=10.1007/s11019-007-9059-1 | volume=10 | title=Brave New World versus Island--utopian and dystopian views on psychopharmacology | journal=Med Health Care Philos | pages=119–28 | last1 = Schermer | first1 = MH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Holy Fire (novel)|Holy Fire]]'' novel refers to the religion in the future as a result of entheogens, used freely by the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* In [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', Book 1 of ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series, the main character receives guidance after taking [[mescaline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* The [[Alastair Reynolds]] novel ''[[Absolution Gap]]'' features a moon under the control of a religious government that uses neurological viruses to induce religious faith.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* A critical examination of the ethical and societal implications and relevance of "entheogenic" experiences can be found in [[Daniel Waterman]] and [[Casey William Hardison]]'s book ''Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility'' (Melrose, Oxford 2013). This book includes a controversial analysis of the term entheogen arguing that Wasson et al. were mystifying the effects of the plants and traditions it refers to.
* The book ''Orange Sunshine and the Psychedelic Sunrise'' covers the continuum of life to death experiences from a personal and existential perspective, with an emphasis on spiritual transcendence: a psychedelic experience.

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

== Anglican churches ==
There are two Anglican churches is Northern Cyprus.  They are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standrewschurchkyrenia.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
* St Andrew's Church in [[Kyrenia]]
* St Mark's Church in [[Famagusta]] visit:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stmarksfamagusta.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox Christianity ==
In 2010, the US Department of State reported that "Greek Cypriot Orthodox and Maronite Catholics were allowed to perform religious services on a regular basis, without prior permission."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148926.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, Resolution 1631, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... calling for the protection of religious sites and artifacts from and in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus as well as for general respect for religious freedom."&lt;ref name=aw&gt;[http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/10/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-foreign-ministry-decries-%E2%80%98biased-resolution%E2%80%99-on-n-cyprus/ Turkey’s Foreign Ministry Decries ‘Biased Resolution’ on N. Cyprus by Nanore Barsoumian] Armenian Weekly, 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a press released statement, saying that the resolution had "many factual errors which may harm the credibility of the House of Representatives".&lt;ref name=aw/&gt;

On 27 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], in written declaration no. 467, condemned the alleged interruption of the Christmas mass in Northern Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship.&lt;ref name="coe467"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf Interruption of the Christmas mass in the northern occupied part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225181325/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf |date=2011-02-25 }} Written Declaration No. 467, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Doc. 12505, 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The declaration claimed that Turkish troops forced the priest conducting the service to remove his vestments and ordered everybody to leave the church, thus violating the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="coe467" /&gt;

On 18 March 2011, 204 Greek school books, including religious books, that were being taken to the schools at Rizokarpaso were confiscated by Turkish Cypriot customs officers at the Pergamos village barricade. The Turkish Cypriot daily newspaper ''Afrika'', in a front page article, criticised those who claim that there is freedom of religion in Northern Cyprus when the religious books were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrikagazetesi.net/arsivafrika/Mart2011/18mart2011.pdf Islam fanatizmi Isa'ya yasak, Turkish translation: "Islam fanaticism, ban Jesus"], Afrika newspaper, 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church service restriction controversy===
On 20 May 2016, Northern Cypriot Foreign Minister [[Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu]] restricted Greek Orthodox communities to only hold a single religious service per year, with the exceptions of the [[Apostolos Andreas Monastery]] in Rizokarpaso, the [[Monastery of St. Barnabas]] in Famagusta and [[Morphou#Church|St. Mamas' Church]] in Morphou. The remaining churches could be used for one of the following three feasts: the church's [[Name days in Greece|Name Day]], [[Easter]] or [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=CyMail&gt;{{cite news |author=Andria Kades |title=Turkish Cypriot side restricts Orthodox church services in north |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/24/turkish-cypriot-side-restricts-orthodox-church-services-north/ |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undersecretary Mustafa Lakadamyalı claimed that the move was to prevent the "abuse" of the permission to hold masses, also citing difficulties with the policing of more than one mass a day or frequent masses. Lakadamyalı also said that "whilst some TRNC citizens can pass to the south even for worship, some absolutely cannot". No restriction was placed on Maronites.&lt;ref name=Kibris&gt;{{cite web |title=KKTC'deki kilse ayinlerine sınırlama |publisher=[[Kıbrıs (newspaper)|Kıbrıs]] |url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=797018 |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was harshly criticized by Turkish Cypriot group [[Famagusta Initiative]] as "chauvinist and intolerant" and it was pointed out that no problem was encountered in the masses which took place in, for example, the [[Nestorian Church (Famagusta)|Nestorian Church]] in Famagusta.&lt;ref name=Kibris /&gt; Ertuğruloğlu's decision was also criticized by Burak Mavis of the [[Turkish Cypriot Teachers’ Trade Union]] (KTOS) who called out the whole debate as being driven by "a backwards and racist political mentality," but it was defended by [[Yilmaz Bora]], the leader of the Association of the Ex-Servicemen of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]], who was cited as saying "it was not possible to live with the Greek Cypriots in a United Cyprus, because the mentality of the Greek Cypriots has not changed in 53 years."&lt;ref name=CyMail /&gt;

'''''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World''''' is a 2009 book by [[John Micklethwait]] and [[Adrian Wooldridge]] which argues against the [[secularization]] thesis and claims that there is a global revival of faith has started in the late twentieth century.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge provided a quick coverage of American history, in which they argue that American religion was dramatically transformed by the [[disestablishment]] of churches after the [[American Revolution]].  An emerging "[[marketplace of ideas|free market]]" of religious choices led Americans to become increasingly pluralistic and tolerant of other forms of Christianity.  The voluntary nature of religious association led Americans to take ownership of their own institutions and churches, helping create a democratic sense of responsibility for creating associations and community.  These features of American culture, along with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] separation of church and state, ensured that American religions could only survive by appealing to the common people.  This democratized American Christianity, leading average Americans to shape religious movements themselves.  In the post-Revolutionary period, all this led America in an increasingly pluralist and democratic direction.&lt;ref name=gib&gt;John Micklethwait and Arian Wooldridge, ''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith is Changing the World'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2009), 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features.  World religions—and Christianity, in particular—are growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest.  Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that [[Islam]] too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.&lt;ref name=gib/&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "A meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation about the place of faith in modern life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-micklethwait/god-is-back/ |title=''God is Back'' by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge |date=March 15, 2009 |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24340">'''Gödel's ontological proof''' is a formal argument by the mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] (1906–1978) for [[God]]'s existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of ''positive'' and ''negative'' properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.

The argument is in a line of development that goes back to [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109).  St. Anselm's [[ontological argument]], in its most succinct form, is as follows: "God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in [[reality]]. Therefore, God must exist." A more elaborate version was given by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.

Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers.&lt;ref&gt;In: Wang, Hao. ''A Logical Journey: From Gödel to Philosophy.'' A Bradford Book, 1997. Print. p.316.&lt;/ref&gt; Points relevant to the ontological proof include
:4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.
:5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.
:13. There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most highly fruitful for science.
:14. Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not.

== History ==
The first version of the ontological proof in Gödel's papers is dated "around 1941". Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed [[Dana Scott]] to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, Gödel told [[Oskar Morgenstern]] that he was "satisfied" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that Gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think "that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible)."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gödel 1995, p. 388. The German original is quoted in Dawson 1997, p. 307. The nested parentheses are in Morgenstern's original diary entry, as quoted by Dawson.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The publication history of the proof in this paragraph is from Gödel 1995, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for Gödel's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entry—that Gödel did not believe in God—is not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers,&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; He did the same in an interview with a skeptical [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], who said: "I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] Gödel smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 317. The ellipsis is Wikipedia's.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang reports that Gödel's wife, Adele, two days after Gödel's death, told Wang that "Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is ''[[Theism|theistic]]'', not [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] rather than [[Spinoza]]."&lt;ref group=note&gt;Gödel's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p. 18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p. 112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p. 6,
who cites Wang 1987.

The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in Gödel's papers. Gödel filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. "Theistic" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not Gödel's.

The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads "Baptist Lutheran" where Wang 1996 has "baptized Lutheran". "Baptist Lutheran" makes no sense, especially in context, and was presumably a typo or mistranscription. Wang 1987 has "rel. cong.", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to "religious congregation".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==

The proof uses [[modal logic]], which distinguishes between [[logical truth|''necessary'' truths]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|''contingent'' truths]]. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many "[[Modal logic#Semantics|possible worlds]]" are considered. A [[truth]] is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is ''contingent'' if it just happens to be the case. For instance, "more than half of this planet is covered by water" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet "this planet" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a ''[[logically possible|possible]]'' truth.

Furthermore, the proof uses [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, 2002, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a "positive property":&lt;ref group=note&gt;This assumes that it is possible to single out ''positive'' properties from among all properties. Gödel comments that "Positive means positive in the [[moral]] [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] sense (independently of the accidental structure of the world)... It may also mean pure ''attribution'' as opposed to ''privation'' (or containing privation)." (Gödel 1995), see also manuscript in (Gawlick 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; for each property ''φ'', either ''φ'' or its [[negation]] ¬''φ'' must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property ''φ'' implies a property ''ψ'' in each possible world, then ''ψ'' is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is "possibly exemplified", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Axioms 1, 2 and 3 can be summarized by saying that positive properties form a principal [[ultrafilter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel shows that in ''some'' possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called "God" in the following.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By removing all modal operators from axioms, definitions, proofs, and theorems, a modified version of theorem 2 is obtained saying "∃''x'' ''G''(''x'')", i.e. "There exists an object which has all positive, but no negative properties". Nothing more than axioms 1-3, definition 1, and theorems 1-2 needs to be considered for this result.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in ''every'' possible world.

To this end, he defines ''essences'': if ''x'' is an object in some world, then a property ''φ'' is said to be an essence of ''x'' if ''φ''(''x'') is true in that world and if ''φ'' necessarily entails all other properties that ''x'' has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, ''x'' is said to ''exist necessarily'' if, for every essence ''φ'' of ''x'', there is an element ''y'' with property ''φ'' in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.

Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic{{clarify|reason=They should be stated.|date=August 2016}} were tacitly used in the proof.

From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the [[identity of indiscernibles]]: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. Gödel did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.

There is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize Gödel's proof to a level that is suitable for [[automated theorem proving]] or at least computer verification via [[proof assistant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod&lt;/ref&gt;  The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by [[Melvin Fitting]]'s book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=David|title=Scientists Use Computer to Mathematically Prove Gödel's God Theorem|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/scientists-use-computer-to-mathematically-prove-goedel-god-theorem-a-928668.html|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Most criticism of Gödel's proof is aimed at its axioms: As with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. This is particularly applicable to Gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.

Many philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by [[Jordan Howard Sobel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jordan Howard Sobel | authorlink=Jordan Howard Sobel|contribution=Gödel's ontological proof | pages=241–261 | isbn=978-0262200639 | editor=Judith Jarvis Thomson |editorlink=Judith Jarvis Thomson | title=On Being and Saying: Essays for Richard Cartwright | location=Cambridge/MA &amp; London, England | publisher=MIT Press | date=Nov 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a "modal collapse" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are [[accessibility relation|accessible]] worlds at all).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally, &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' implies &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p \Rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' by [[indirect proof]], and &lt;math&gt;\Box p \Rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''p'' whenever there are accessible worlds.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Koons,&lt;ref name="Koons.2005"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Sobel suggested that Gödel might have welcomed modal collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-19-507255-3 | url=https://monoskop.org/images/a/aa/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_Collected_Works_Volume_III_1995.pdf | author=Kurt Gödel |editor1 = Solomon Feferman | editor2= John W.

Rather, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) \Rightarrow \Box \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; should follow first from the existence of God."'' The note might indicate that Gödel was aware of his axioms implying modal collapse.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by [[C. Anthony Anderson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/anderson-anthony-c-22some-emendations-of-gc3b6dels-ontological-proof22.pdf | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson | authorlink=Curtis Anthony Anderson | title=Some Emendations of Gödel's Ontological Proof | journal=[[Faith and Philosophy]] | volume=7 | number=3 | pages=291&amp;mdash;303 | date=Jul 1990 | doi=10.5840/faithphil19907325}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235417020 | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson and Michael Gettings | contribution=Gödel's ontological proof revisited | editor=Petr Hájek | title=Proc.

Gödel's proof has also been questioned by [[Graham Oppy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments | author=Graham Oppy | authorlink=Graham Oppy | title=Godelian ontological arguments | journal=Analysis | volume=54 | number=4 | pages=226&amp;mdash;230 | date=Oct 1996 | doi = 10.1093/analys/56.4.226 }} &amp;mdash; [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graham_Oppy/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments/links/0f3175343e378809ad000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail Longer version (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be "proven" by Gödel's axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gettings Michael | year = 1999 | title = Gödel's ontological argument: a reply to Oppy | url = | journal = Analysis | volume = 59 | issue = 264| pages = 309–313 | doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00184}}&lt;/ref&gt; who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from Gödel's axioms.

Religious scholars such as [[Robert Spitzer (priest)|Fr. Robert J. Spitzer]] have accepted Gödel's proof, calling it "an improvement over the Anselmian Ontological Argument (which does not work)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magiscenter.com/proof-from-godel-theorem-shows-god-exists-through-super-axiom/|title=Godel's Theorem and the Existence of God|date=2017-04-26|work=Magis Center|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, many more criticisms, most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms ''must'' be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous [[Synthetic geometry#Logical synthesis|remark]] about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in Gödel's ontological axioms (''"positive", "god-like", "essence"'') as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (''"point", "line", "plane"''). According to [[André Fuhrmann]] (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies Gödel's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19453127/Homepage/downloads/GoedelExistenzNotwendigkeit.pdf | author=André Fuhrmann | chapter=Existenz und Notwendigkeit &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödels axiomatische Theologie |trans-chapter=Existence and Necessity &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödel's Axiomatic Theology | language=German | pages=349&amp;mdash;374 | editor=W. Spohn | title=Logik in der Philosophie |trans-title=Logic in Philosophy | location=Heidelberg | publisher=Synchron | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|364–366}} It is this task which decides which religion's god has been proven to exist.

The '''history of religious pluralism''' is the fruit of a long development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[postmodernity]].

==Asia==
===India===
India has been a place of fertile religious endeavour since the latter part of the [[Vedic period]]. Jainism and Buddhism, which were part of the ''[[sramana]]'' movement have been from their inception religions motivated by compassion for all creatures as well as believers in the inherent rationality and reasonableness of true religion. They have thus sought and advocated rational debate concerning matters of truth. India is, in fact, as far as we can tell the home of the first written statement of religious pluralism, tolerance and interfaith dialogue. The [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict XII]] by the Emperor [[Ashoka]] states the following:

::{{cquote|''The beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds. But the beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values this - that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions. Growth in essentials can be done in different ways, but all of them have as their root restraint in speech, that is, not praising one's own religion, or condemning the religion of others without good cause. And if there is cause for criticism, it should be done in a mild way. But it is better to honor other religions for this reason. By so doing, one's own religion benefits, and so do other religions, while doing otherwise harms one's own religion and the religions of others. Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought "Let me glorify my own religion," only harms his own religion. Therefore contact between religions is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions.

''Those who are content with their own religion should be told this: the beloved of the gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions. And to this end many are working - dhamma [[Mahamatra]]s, Mahamatras in charge of the women's quarters, officers in charge of outlying areas, and other such officers. And the fruit of this is that one's own religion grows and the dhamma is illuminated also.''&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Ven S Dhammika&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Religious tolerance was promoted to varying degrees during the course of several [[Muslim]] settlements ([[Delhi Sultanate]] 1276-1526 AD and the [[Mughal Empire]] 1526–1857 AD). In the 8th century, [[Zoroastrianism]] was established in India as Zoroastrians fled from [[Iran|Persia]] to [[India]] in large numbers, where they were given refuge. The colonial phase ushered in by the British lasted until 1947 and furthered conversions to [[Christianity]] among low caste Hindus. In 1948 as many as 20,000 Jews [[Bene Israel|Bene Jews]] and [[Cochin Jews]] lived in India, though most of them have since emigrated to Israel.

Although in [[Japan]] Buddhism and [[Shinto]] have more or less co-existed for centuries, the arrival of Christianity through [[Francis Xavier]] led to widespread persecution of Christians and the eventual exclusion of Christianity for hundreds of years until the [[Meiji era]], as the rulers of Japan saw it as a threat. Christians and Buddhists were also persecuted under [[State Shinto]].

===Mongol Empire===
Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions during the early [[Mongol Empire]], and typically sponsored several at the same time. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a [[shamanist]]. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service.&lt;ref name=Weatherford&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|year=2004|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-609-80964-4|ref=harv|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongol emperors were known for organizing competitions of religious debates among clerics, and these would draw large audiences.

Religious pluralism existed in medieval [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic ethics]], as the [[religious law]]s and [[court]]s of other religions, including [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{citation|last=Weeramantry|first=Judge Christopher G.|title=Justice Without Frontiers: Furthering Human Rights|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|last=Sachedina|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-513991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Islamic societies, the ''[[qadi]]'' (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the ''[[dhimmi]]'' communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own ''[[Halakha]]'' courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order.&lt;ref name = "al-Qattan-99"&gt;{{Citation | first=Najwa | last= al-Qattan | title= Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination | journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=429–444 | publisher=University of Cambridge |year=1999 | doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of [[alcohol]] and [[pork]], as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292-1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

==Europe==

===Antiquity===
The polytheistic [[Roman empire]] saw the traditional Roman religion as one fundamentals of the Roman republic. They saw Roman virtues as an important link in their multi-ethnic empire. Being polytheistic, Romans did not mind if conquered nations went on worshiping their traditional gods, as long as they also presented token offerings to the Roman gods. In many cases this compromise was easily reached by identifying the traditional gods with similar Roman gods.  Failure to offer up this token worship was seen as disloyal to Rome, and an act of political rebellion against the Emperor. 

There was, though, a problem with people whose religion excluded the veneration of other gods - especially the Jews and the Christians. The Romans tended to view this as rebellion, and so it resulted in many conflicts arising from often unintended offenses, like putting a statue of an emperor in a prominent place in [[Jerusalem]] which resulted in a public revolt. Similarly difficult to understand for the Roman mindset was the attitude of Christians who rather chose [[torture]] or [[death]] instead of offering [[incense]] to the Roman emperor. From the Roman view, the refusal to venerate the Roman emperor was political treason.

The [[edict of Milan]] which decreed tolerance of Christianity was followed by a time of parallel existence of Christianity and paganism which was, though, far from an actual religious pluralism - the religion of the emperor was always at an advantage, and the [[Arianism|Arian]], [[Trinity|trinitarian]] and pagan emperors in the fourth century saw it as perfectly legitimate to take measures against religious leaders who did not share their belief.  By the fifth century, the western Roman Empire had crumbled, but the same patterns of behavior continued in the eastern Roman Empire along with the Gaulish, Celtic, and Germanic kingdoms that replaced the west.

===Middle Ages===
After the breakdown of the Roman Empire in the west, in western Europe the population was a huge, diverse mix of Latin peoples, Germanic peoples who had been absorbed into the Empire and its Legions over the course of hundreds of years, and newly arriving Germanic tribes that were migrating into western Europe.  In each of these vaguely defined categories were some Christians, some pagans, and some who subscribed to some elements of both. In the German tradition, the chief of the tribe was also religious leader, so conversion of the leaders (even if for political reasons) was followed in many cases by Christianization of the tribe - with the chief of the tribe being now the de facto head of the Christian church. There were very frequent instances of parallel pagan and Christian religion, but tolerance of old or new religion was up to the personal preference of the local lord.  

The tradition of the head of the tribe as head of the church was continued by the Kings which these chieftains eventually evolved into, with the king and/or emperor holding by virtue of office the right of investiture of [[bishop]]s and also of deciding in religious matters - [[Charlemagne]], e.g., took the [[Pope]] to task for not using the [[Filioque clause|filioque]] in the [[Nicene Creed]]. The religion of the ruler was the official religion of the people and, again, any tolerance of foreigners or remnants of pagans was up to the present ruler. The unity of religion was generally seen as a prerequisite for any worldly state - a divergent religion was in the consequence not regarded just as a religious problem but also an action against state and ruler punishable by criminal law.

In the high Middle Ages, the worldly powers clashed with the power of the pope on the matter of deciding about religious questions - 
while the details varied by country, the overall result was that the Roman Catholic Church was able to, for a short time, exercise control over the religious practices of countries, even against that Ruler's will.

===Protestant Reformation===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation }}
The Protestant Reformation broke away from the Catholic Church over religious policy and belief in Europe and touched off the [[30-years War]] which involved virtually every nation on the European continent.  Much of the fighting occurred between German and Swiss nobility who had sided with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]'s Protestant movement, and French and Spanish forces under the command of the then-French Papacy.  After the religious wars, the general rule was "cuius regio, eius religio" - the countries and principalities had to adopt the religion of their respective ruler, while divergent people were left with the choice between submission or [[emigration]].

Restrictions on smaller Protestant sects who disagreed with the national churches in these countries prompted such groups as the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] to seek freedom in [[North America]], although when these became the majority they sometimes sought to deny this freedom to Jews and Roman Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In [[Transylvania]] it was declared in 1568 at [[Turda]] the [[religious tolerance]] for every religion and it was realised the religious pluralism. The role of authority was to supervise the peaceful religious cohabitation between Catholics, Calvinist, Lutheran, antirtinitarians, orthodox, sabbatharians, Jews and Muslims. The Transylvanian situation remained for long time an isolated fearful model of "diabolic liberty" (Beze, Basel,1569)but was well known and appreciated between religious persecuted antitrinitarians in Holland and in England.

===Enlightenment===

{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the second half of the seventeenth century, partially out of being tired with the religious wars, partially influenced by early enlightenment, several countries adopted some sort of tolerance for other denominations, e.g. the [[Peace of Westphalia]] 1653 or the [[Edict of toleration|Edict of Tolerance]] in England in 1689.

Protestant and freethinking philosophers like [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Paine]], who argued for tolerance and moderation in religion, were strongly influential on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], and the modern religious freedom and equality underlying religious pluralism in the [[United States]] are guaranteed by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which states:

:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

In the United States religious pluralism can be said to be overseen by the secular state, which guarantees equality under law between different religions, whether these religion have a handful of adherents or many millions. The state also guarantees the freedom of those who choose not to belong to any religion. 

While the United States had to begin with no dominant religion or denomination, this was very different in European countries who have, except for some Balkan states, a history with one dominant Christian denomination whose influence on their culture is felt until present times. Enlightenment in Europe did not so much promote the rights of minority religions but the rights of individuals to express beliefs diverging from the mainstream religion of the country, while belonging to that religion or being outside of it. While European countries generally went the way of gradually increasing the rights for minority denominations and religions, up to today the stress has been more on the freedom of belief of the individual, whereas the rights of religious organizations are often limited by the state to prevent them intruding upon the individual religious freedom.

A '''Holy Lie''' is a philosophical concept coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his note manuscript [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|''The Will to Power'']]. It is also mentioned in another of Nietzsche's books, [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Antichrist'']].

== Sources ==
The idea of a holy lie is seen in part one of the second book of "The Will to Power," which consists of two critiques. The two critiques are "the critique of religion" and "the critique of morality" respectively.

== Concept ==
A holy lie, according to Friedrich Nietzsche, is the means by which priests and philosophers obtain the piety of their audiences.&lt;ref name="Der wille"/&gt;{{quote|The means he employs are as follows: he alone is all knowing; he alone is virtuous......|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 139|source=}}

Nietzsche argues that the purpose of human action is altered by the holy lie since the original moral standards of the general public is influenced by the moral standards preached by the priests and philosophers. Consequently, the human faculty of moral judgment based on the "beneficial" versus the "harmful" is in dysfunction. People who accept the holy lie do not evaluate the fairness of a thing by what Nietzsche calls "The natural notion". Instead, the notions, standards and doctrines preached by the preachers(priests and philosophers) substitutes the natural notion.&lt;ref name="Der wille"&gt;The Will to Power. Page 94-96. Penguin Classics&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In this way, a conception of ''good'' and ''evil'' is created which appears to be entirely detached from the natural notions......In this way, the famous notion of "Conscience" is finally created. An inner voice which does not evaluate an act by its consequences, but by its intention and conformity of that intention to the "Law".|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 141|source=}}

In his book ''The Antichrist'', Nietzsche further explains his idea with an example of [[Paul the Apostle]] and the downfall of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Antichrist.Note 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wodden Carvings of the Bululs.jpg|thumb|Wooden images of the ancestors (''[[Bulul]]'') in a museum in [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Mountain Province]], [[Philippines]]]]
Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

'''Jhākri''' ({{lang-ne|झाक्री}}) is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for [[shaman]]. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the [[Tamang people]] and the [[Magars]]; it is also used in the [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]], which border [[Nepal]].

Jhākri shamanism is practiced among numerous [[ethnic group]]s of Nepal and [[Northeast India]], including the [[Limbu people|Limbu]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Sunwar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Tamang people|Tamang]], [[Gurung people|Gurung]], [[Magars]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Khas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |pp=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of [[spirit possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some vernacular words for ''jhākri'' are ''phedangbo'' in the [[Limbu language]], ''maangpa'' or ''nakchyong'' in [[Khambu]], and ''boongthing'' in [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]].

Jhākris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mun (religion)|Mun]], and [[Bön]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martial temples''', ({{zh|c=武庙|p=wǔmiào}}), also translated as '''military temples''' or '''warrior temples''', are Chinese temples dedicated to worshiping outstanding military leaders and strategists (excluding kings and emperors). They were often built by the governments as the counterpart of civil temples (''wenmiao'') or [[Temple of Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWvfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Civil-Military Relations in Chinese History: From Ancient China to the Communist Takeover|editor=Kai Filipiak |page=134 |isbn=9781317573449 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1N5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Global and Regional in China’s Nation-Formation |author= Prasenjit Duara |page=87 |isbn=9781134015306|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples that worshiped both civil and military gods are called [[Wenwu temple]] (''wenwumiao'').

Martial temples originated from China in 731 BC, initially for worshiping 11 strategists, among whom [[Jiang Ziya]] was the dominant figure. The rest of the 10 strategists with comparatively inferior status were called ''Shizhe'' (十哲), which means "Ten Wise Men", among whom [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] had the highest status, only below [[Jiang Ziya]]. It was supposed to be worshipped in spring and autumn, and the formality would be similar to the worshiping of the [[Temple of Confucius]]. 

The people being worshipped in the temple however changed in subsequent periods of history. In Qing Dynasty, [[Guan Yu]] (as Guandi or Wudi, the God of War) became the major god in the Martial Temple. Offerings may be made to Guandi on the 15th day or the second month and the 13th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rY4gBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Guandi |title=Gods &amp; Goddesses of Ancient China|editor= Trenton Campbell |publisher=Rosen Education Service |isbn=9781622753949}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Republic of China established in 1912, the government promoted the joint worshiping of [[Guan Yu]] and [[Yue Fei]], the latter was considered a [[folk hero|national hero]] in defending Southern Song Dynasty from the invasion of Jurchen Jin. 24 other strategists in the history were also worshiped along Guan Yu and Yue Fei, but with lower status. After the People's Republic of China established in 1949, the government no longer officially promoted Martial Temple.

[[File:StAnthony.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony of Egypt|St. Anthony the Great]] of Egypt, considered the Father of [[Christian]] Monasticism]]

A '''monk'''  ({{IPAc-en|m|ʌ|ŋ|k}}, from {{lang-el|μοναχός}},  ''monachos'', "single, solitary" via [[Latin]] ''monachus''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmonaxo%2Fs μοναχός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"monk, n.1". OED Online, 3rd edn. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a person who practices religious [[asceticism]] by [[monastic]]  living, either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave [[mainstream]] [[society]] and live his or her life in [[prayer]] and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.

In the Greek language the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is mainly in use for men. The word [[nun]] is typically used for female monastics.

Although the term ''monachos'' is of Christian origin, in the English language ''monk'' tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds.  However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as [[cenobite]], [[hermit]], [[anchorite]], [[Hesychasm|hesychast]], or solitary.

==Orthodox Christianity==
[[File:07Athos St Dionysius02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionysiou monastery|Monastery of St. Dionysius]] on [[Mount Athos]].]]

In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] monasticism holds a very special and important place: "Angels are a light for monks, monks are a light for laymen" ([[John Climacus|St. John Klimakos]]). Orthodox monastics separate themselves from the [[world (theology)|world]] in order to pray unceasingly for the world. They do not, in general, have as their primary purpose the running of social services, but instead are concerned with attaining [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], or union with God. However, care for the poor and needy has always been an obligation of monasticism,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} so not all monasteries are "cloistered". The level of contact though will vary from community to community. Hermits, on the other hand, have little or no contact with the outside world.

Orthodox monasticism does not have [[religious orders]] as are found in the West, nor do they have Rules in the same sense as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]. Rather, Eastern monastics study and draw inspiration from the writings of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as other [[Church Fathers]]; probably the most influential of which are the ''Greater Asketikon'' and ''Lesser Asketikon'' of St. Basil the Great and the ''[[Philokalia]]'', which was compiled by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth. [[Hesychasm]] is of primary importance in the ascetical theology of the Orthodox Church.

[[File:Макарьево Свято-Троице-Макарьево-Желтоводский монастырь N56 05.402 E45 03.647.jpg|thumb|General view of [[Makaryev Monastery|Holy Trinity-Makaryev Monastery]], on the [[Volga River]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], [[Russia]].]]

Most communities are self-supporting, and the monastic’s daily life is usually divided into three parts: (a) communal worship in the [[Katholikon|catholicon]] (the monastery's main church); (b) hard manual labour; and (c) private prayer, spiritual study, and rest when necessary. Meals are usually taken in common in a sizable dining hall known as a [[refectory|trapeza]] (refectory), at elongated [[refectory table]]s. Food is usually simple and is eaten in silence while one of the brethren reads aloud from the spiritual writings of the [[Church Fathers|Holy Fathers]]. The monastic lifestyle takes a great deal of serious commitment. Within the cenobitic community, all monks conform to a common way of living based on the traditions of that particular monastery. In struggling to attain this conformity, the monastic comes to realize his own shortcomings and is guided by his [[starets|spiritual father]] in how to deal honestly with them. For this same reason, [[Bishop#Bishops in Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches|bishops]] are almost always chosen from the ranks of monks.

Eastern monasticism is found in three distinct forms: [[anchorites|anchoritic]] (a solitary living in isolation), [[cenobitic]] (a community living and worshiping together under the direct rule of an abbot or abbess), and the "middle way" between the two, known as the [[skete]] (a community of individuals living separately but in close proximity to one another, who come together only on Sundays and feast days, working and praying the rest of the time in solitude, but under the direction of an elder). One normally enters a cenobitic community first, and only after testing and spiritual growth would one go on to the skete or, for the most advanced, become a solitary anchorite. However, one is not necessarily expected to join a skete or become a solitary; most monastics remain in the cenobium the whole of their lives.

In general, Orthodox monastics have little or no contact with the outside world, including their own families. The purpose of the monastic life is union with God, the means is through leaving the world (i.e., the life of the passions). After tonsure, Orthodox monks and nuns are never permitted to cut their hair. The hair of the head and the beard remain uncut as a symbol of the vows they have taken, reminiscent of the [[Nazarite]]s from the [[Old Testament]]. The [[tonsure]] of monks is the token of a consecrated life, and symbolizes the cutting off of their self-will.

===Degrees===

{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}
[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|upright|left|The Great Schema worn by Orthodox monks and nuns of the most advanced degree]]

The process of becoming a monk is intentionally slow, as the [[vows]] taken are considered to entail a lifelong commitment to God, and are not to be entered into lightly. In Orthodox monasticism after completing the novitiate, there are three ranks of monasticism. There is only one [[religious habit|monastic habit]] in the Eastern Church (with certain slight regional variations), and it is the same for both monks and nuns. Each successive grade is given a portion of the habit, the full habit being worn only by those in the highest grade, known for that reason as the "Great Schema", or "Great Habit".

The various profession rites are normally performed by the Abbot, but if the abbot has not been ordained a priest, or if the monastic community is a convent, a [[hieromonk]] will perform the service. The abbot or hieromonk who performs a tonsure must be of at least the rank he is tonsuring into. In other words, only a hieromonk who has been tonsured into the Great Schema may himself tonsure a Schemamonk. A bishop, however, may tonsure into any rank, regardless of his own.

''Novice'' ([[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Poslushnik''), lit. "one under obedience"—Those wishing to join a monastery begin their lives as novices. After coming to the monastery and living as a guest for not less than three days, the revered abbot or abbess may bless the candidate to become a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice, he or she simply receives permission to wear the clothing of a novice. In the Eastern monastic tradition, novices may or may not dress in the black [[Endorasson|inner cassock]] (Greek: ''Anterion'', ''Eisorasson''; Church Slavonic: ''Podriasnik'') and wear the soft monastic hat (Greek: ''[[Skoufos]]'', Church Slavonic: ''Skufia''), depending on the tradition of the local community, and in accordance to the abbot’s directives. The inner-cassock and the skoufos are the first part of the Orthodox monastic habit. In some communities, the novice also wears the leather belt. He is also given a [[prayer rope]] and instructed in the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. If a novice chooses to leave during the period of the novitiate, no penalty is incurred. He may also be asked to leave at any time if his behaviour does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that he is not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, he is asked if he wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily.

''Rassophore'' (Church Slavonic: ''Ryassofor''), lit. "Robe-bearer"—If the novice continues on to become a monk, he is clothed in the first degree of monasticism at a formal service known as the [[Tonsure]]. Although there are no formal [[vows]] made at this point, the candidate is normally required to affirm his commitment to persevere in the monastic life. The abbot will then perform the tonsure, cutting a small amount of hair from four spots on the head, forming a cross. He is then given the outer cassock (Greek: ''Rasson'', ''Exorasson'', or ''Mandorasson''; Church Slavonic: ''Ryassa'')—an outer robe with wide sleeves, something like the [[cowl]] used in the West, but without a hood—from which the name of Rassophore is derived. He is also given a brimless hat with a veil, known as a [[klobuk]], and a leather belt is fastened around his waist. His habit is usually black, signifying that he is now dead to the world, and he receives a new name. Although the Rassophore does not make formal vows, he is still morally obligated to continue in the monastic estate for the rest of his life. Some will remain Rassophores permanently without going on to the higher degrees.

''Stavrophore'' (Church Slavonic: ''Krestonosets''), lit. "Cross-bearer"—The next level for Eastern monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbot feels the monk has reached an appropriate level of discipline, dedication, and humility. This degree is also known as the ''Little Schema'', and is considered to be a "betrothal" to the Great Schema. At this stage, the monk makes formal vows of stability, [[chastity, obedience and poverty]]. Then he is tonsured and clothed in the habit, which in addition to that worn by the Rassophore, includes the ''paramandyas'' (Church Slavonic: ''paraman''), a piece of square cloth worn on the back, embroidered with the instruments of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] (see picture above), and connected by ties to a wooden cross worn over the heart. The paramandyas represents the yoke of Christ. Because of this addition he is now called ''Stavrophore'', or ''Cross-bearer''. He is also given a wooden hand cross (or "profession cross"), which he should keep in his [[icon corner]], and a beeswax candle, symbolic of monastic vigilance the sacrificing of himself for God. He will be buried holding the cross, and the candle will be burned at his funeral. In the Slavic practice, the Stavrophore also wears the monastic [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]]. The rasson (outer robe) worn by the Stavrophore is more ample than that worn by the Rassophore. The abbot increases the Stavrophore monk’s prayer rule, allows a more strict personal ascetic practice, and gives the monk more responsibility.

''Great Schema'' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos'', Church Slavonic: ''Skhimnik'')—Monks whose abbot feels they have reached a high level of spiritual excellence reach the final stage, called the [[Great Schema]]. The tonsure of a Schemamonk follows the same format as the Stavrophore, and he makes the same vows and is tonsured in the same manner. But in addition to all the garments worn by the Stavrophore, he is given the ''Analavos'' (Church Slavonic: ''Analav'') which is the article of monastic vesture emblematic of the Great Schema. For this reason, the analavos itself is sometimes called the "Great Schema". The analavos comes down in the front and the back, somewhat like the [[scapular]] in Western monasticism, although the two garments are probably not related. It is often intricately embroidered with the instruments of the Passion and the [[Trisagion]] (the angelic hymn). The Greek form does not have a hood, the Slavic form has a hood and lappets on the shoulders, so that the garment forms a large cross covering the monk's shoulders, chest, and back. Another piece added is the ''Polystavrion'' or "Many Crosses", which consists of a cord with a number of small crosses plaited into it.  The polystavrion forms a yoke around the monk and serves to hold the analavos in place, and reminds the monastic that he is bound to Christ and that his arms are no longer fit for worldly activities, but that he must labor only for the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].  Among the Greeks, the mantle is added at this stage.  The paramandyas of the Megaloschemos is larger than that of the Stavrophore, and if he wears the klobuk, it is of a distinctive thimble shape, called a ''[[cowl|koukoulion]]'', the veil of which is usually embroidered with crosses.  In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.

Eastern Orthodox monks are addressed as "Father" even if they are not priests; but when conversing among themselves, monks will often address one another as "Brother".  Novices are always referred to as "Brother". Among the Greeks, old monks are often called ''Gheronda'', or "Elder", out of respect for their dedication.  In the Slavic tradition, the title of Elder (Church Slavonic: ''[[Starets]]'') is normally reserved for those who are of an advanced spiritual life, and who serve as guides to others.

For the Orthodox, ''Mother'' is the correct term for nuns who have been tonsured Stavrophore or higher. Novices and Rassophores are addressed as "Sister".  Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachai'' (the feminine plural of ''monachos''), and their community is likewise called a monastery.

Many (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer, and hopefully benefiting from the example and wise counsel of the monks.  Bishops are required by the [[canon law|sacred canons]] of the Orthodox Church to be chosen from among the monastic clergy. The requirement is specifically that they be monastics, not simply celibate (see [[clerical celibacy]]).  Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called [[hieromonk]]s (priest-monks); monks who have been ordained to the [[diaconate]] are called [[hierodeacon]]s (deacon-monks).  A Schemamonk who is a priest is called a Hieroschemamonk.  Most monks are not ordained; a community will normally only present as many candidates for ordination to the bishop as the liturgical needs of the community require.

==Western Christianity==

===Roman Catholicism===
[[File:Kovelklein.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|Order of Saint Benedict]]
[[File:Czestochowa-bazylika.jpg|thumb|upright|The famed monastery of [[Jasna Góra]] is one of the last run by the [[Pauline Fathers]], an important order in the history of the monastic tradition.]]
[[File:Czerwony Klasztor.jpg|thumb|Monastery [[Červený Kláštor (monastery)|Červený Kláštor]] in [[Slovakia]]]]

Within Roman Catholicism, a monk is a member of a [[Catholic religious order|religious order]] who lives a communal life in a [[monastery]], [[abbey]], or [[priory]] under a monastic rule of life (such as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]). [[St. Benedict of Nursia]], (480-543 or 547 AD) is considered to be the founder of western monasticism. He authored the [[Rule of St. Benedict]], which is the foundation for the [[Order of St. Benedict]] and all of its reform groups such as the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]]. He founded the great Benedictine monastery, [[Monte Cassino]], in 529.

The religious [[vows]] taken in the West were first developed by [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]].  These vows were three in number: obedience, conversion of life, and stability.  Obedience calls for the monk to obey Christ, as represented by the superior person of the monastery, which is an [[abbot]] or [[prior]].  Conversion of life means, generally, that the monk convert himself to the way of a monk, which is death to self and to the world and life to God and to his work. A Christian monk is to be an instrument of God's work. Stability entails that the monk commit himself to the monastery for the remainder of his life, and so, upon death, will be buried at its cemetery.  The vow of stability is unique to Benedictines.

The [[solemn vows]] in other religious communities were eventually established as vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. Poverty requires that they renounce any ownership of property or assets, except for items that were allowed to them by their superior (such as a [[religious habit]], [[shoes]], a [[cloak]], etc.), and to live meekly, sharing whatever they might have with the poor.  Chastity requires that since they were willing to dedicate their lives to God, they sacrificed the love between men and women and would not marry. Also, they give up any act of sexual conduct.

To become a monk, one first must become a [[postulant]], during which time the man lives at the monastery to evaluate whether he is called to become a monk. As a postulant, the man is not bound by any vows, and is free to leave the [[monastery]] at any time. If the postulant and the community agree that the postulant should become a monk, the man is received as a [[novice]], at which time he is given his [[religious habit]], and begins to participate more fully in the life of the monastery. Following a period as a novice, usually six months to a year, the novice professes temporary vows, which can be renewed for a period of years. After a few years, the monk professes [[permanent vows]], which are binding for life.

The monastic life generally consists of prayer in the form of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (also known as the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]) and divine reading (''[[lectio divina]]'') and manual labor. Among most [[religious orders]], monks live in simple, austere rooms called cells and come together daily to celebrate the [[Conventual Mass]] and to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. In most communities, the monks take their meals together in the [[refectory]]. While there is no vow of silence, many communities have a period of silence lasting from evening until the next morning and some others restrict talking to only when it is necessary for the monks to perform their work and during weekly recreation.

[[File:Germany München Monks.jpg|thumb|right|[[Munich]]'s city symbol celebrates its founding by [[Benedictine]] monks—and the origin of its name]]

Monks who have been or will be [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] as [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or [[deacons]] are referred to as ''choir monks'', as they have the obligation to recite the entire [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] daily in [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Those monks who are not [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] are referred to as [[lay brothers]]. In most monastic communities today, little distinction exists between the lay brothers and the choir monks. However, historically, the roles of the two groups of monks within the monastery differed. The work of the choir monks was considered to be prayer, chanting the seven hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] daily whereas the lay brothers provided for the material needs of the community by growing food, preparing meals, maintaining the monastery and the grounds. This distinction arose historically because generally those monks who could read [[Latin]] typically became choir monks, while those monks who were illiterate or could not read [[Latin]] became [[lay brothers]]. Since the lay brothers could not recite the Divine Office in Latin, they would instead pray easily memorizable prayers such as the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] or the [[Hail Mary]] as many as 150 times per day. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the distinction between choir monks and lay brothers has been deemphasized, as the council allowed the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] to be said in the vernacular language, effectively opening participation to all of the monks.

Within western monasticism, it is important to differentiate between monks and [[friars]]. Monks generally live a contemplative life of prayer confined within a monastery while [[friars]] usually engage in an active ministry of service to the outside community. The monastic orders include all [[Benedictines]] (the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and its later reforms including the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]]) and the [[Carthusian]]s, who live according to their own [[Statutes of the Carthusian Order|Statutes]], and not according to the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] proper. Orders of [[friars]] include the [[Franciscan]]s, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], and [[Augustinians]]. Although the [[Canons Regular]], such as the [[Norbertines]], live in community, they are neither monks nor friars as they are characterized by their [[cleric|clerical state]] and not by any monastic vows.

===Anglicanism===
Monastic life in [[England]] came to an abrupt end when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] broke from the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and made himself the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head]] of the [[Church of England]]. He initiated the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], during which all of the [[monastery|monasteries]] within [[England]] were destroyed. A large number of monks were executed, others fled to continental [[Europe]]an monasteries where they were able to continue their monastic life.

Shortly after the beginning of the revival of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] in the Church of England, there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. In the 1840s, the then Anglican priest and future Catholic Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]]. From then on, there have been established many communities of monks, [[friar]]s and other religious communities for men in the [[Anglican Communion]]. There are Anglican [[Benedictine]]s, [[Franciscan]]s, [[Cistercian]]s, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. There are also uniquely Anglican monastic orders such as the [[Society of Saint John the Evangelist]] and the [[Community of the Resurrection]] at [[College of the Resurrection|Mirfield]].

Some Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called "mixed life". Anglican monks recite the Divine Office in choir daily, either the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] or the four offices found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and celebrate the [[Eucharist]] daily. Many orders take on external works such as service to the poor, giving religious retreats, or other active ministries within their immediate communities. Like [[Roman Catholic]] monks, Anglican monks also take the monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

In the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] was at its height, the Anglican Communion had hundreds{{cn|date=October 2015}} of orders and communities and thousands of religious followers. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct.

There are however, still several thousand Anglican monks working today in approximately 200 communities around the world. The most surprising growth has been in the [[Melanesian]] countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal]], in 1925 by [[Ini Kopuria]], is now the largest Anglican community in the world with over 450 brothers in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

===Lutheranism===
[[File:St augustine.jpg|left|thumb|St. Augustine's House Lutheran [[Monastery]] in [[Oxford, Michigan]]]]
[[Loccum Abbey]] and [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries. Since the 19th and 20th century, there has been a renewal in the monastic life among Lutheranism. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icdb.org/show.php?r=osb&amp;PHPSESSID=8ed75cc0dbee7b113b0e220ce70deacd Order of Saint Benedict]. Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American Lutheran traditions, "The Congregation of the Servants of Christ" was established at St. Augustine's House in [[Oxford, Michigan]], in 1958 when some other men joined Father [[Arthur Kreinheder]] in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829997,00.html The Lonely Lutheran Monk], [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] (March 1, 1963). Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there was 2 permanent professed members and 2 long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[Östanbäck monastery]]) and in Germany ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staugustineshouse.org/ Staugustineshouse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]], a religious community of friars and sisters within the tradition of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Bhikkhu}}
{{peoplepalicanon}}
[[File:Monks in Wat Phra Singh - Chiang Mai.jpg|thumb|left|Buddhist monks in [[Thailand]].]]
[[File:Monk resting outside Thag-Thok Gompa, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|left|Monk resting outside Thag-Thok Gompa, [[Ladakh]]]]
[[File:Monk with baby sparrow at Likir Gompa, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|Monk caring for baby [[sparrow]] at Likir Gompa, Ladakh]]

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the term for monk. Their disciplinary code is called the ''[[patimokkha]]'', which is part of the larger ''[[Vinaya]]''. They live lives of [[mendicancy]], and go on a morning almsround ([[Pali]]: ''pindapata'') every day. The local people give food for the monks to eat, though the monks are not permitted to positively ask for anything. The monks live in monasteries, and have an important function in traditional Asian society. Young boys can be ordained as [[samanera]]s. Both bhikkhus and samaneras eat only in the morning, and are not supposed to lead a luxurious life. Their rules forbid the use of money, although this rule is nowadays not kept by all monks. The monks are part of the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]'', the third of the [[Triple Gem]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dhamma]], Sangha.

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the term 'Sangha' strictly speaking refers to those who have achieved certain levels of understanding. They are therefore called 'community of the excellent ones' ({{lang-bo|mchog kyi tshogs}}); however, these in turn need not be monks (i.e., hold such [[religious vows|vows]]). Several Mahayana orders accept female practitioners as monks, instead of using the normal title of "nun", and they are considered equal to male ascetics in all respects.

The [[Bhikkhus]] are only allowed 4 items ''(other than their robes)'': a [[razor]], a [[Sewing needle|needle]], an alms bowl and a water strainer. {{citation needed|reason=Not found on Bhikkhu main page or this one|date=December 2015}}

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, monkhood is part of the system of 'vows of individual liberation'; these vows are taken in order to develop one's own personal ethical discipline. The monks and nuns form the (ordinary) ''sangha''. As for the Vajrayana vows of individual liberation, there are four steps: A lay person may take the 5 vows called 'approaching virtue' (in Tibetan &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''genyen''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; ''dge snyan''&gt;). The next step is to enter the monastic way of life (Tib. ''rabjung'') which includes wearing monk's or nun's [[robes]]. After that, one can become a 'novice' (Pali ''[[samanera]]'', Tib. ''getshül''); the last and final step is to take all vows of the 'fully ordained monk' (''gelong''). This term 'gelong' (Tib. &lt; ''dge long''&gt;, in the female form ''gelongma'') is the translation of Skt. ''bikshu'' (for women ''bikshuni'') which is the equivalent of the Pali term ''[[bhikkhuni]]''; ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the word used in Theravada Buddhism (Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand).
[[File:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|right|Buddhist monks performing ceremony in Hangzhou, China.]]

[[China|Chinese]] Buddhist monks have been traditionally and stereotypically linked with the practice of the [[Chinese martial arts]] or ''Kung fu'', and monks are frequently important characters in [[martial arts film]]s.  This association is focused around the [[Shaolin Monastery]].  The Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]], traditionally credited as the founder of [[Zen]] Buddhism in China, is also claimed to have introduced [[Kalaripayattu]] (which later evolved into Kung Fu) to the country. This latter claim has however been a source of much controversy (see [[Bodhidharma, the martial arts, and the disputed India connection]]) One more feature about the Chinese Buddhist monks is that they practice the burning marks on their scalp, finger or part of the skin on their anterior side of the forearm with incense as a sign of ordination.

In [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]], it is common for boys to spend some time living as a monk in a monastery. Most stay for only a few years and then leave, but a number continue on in the ascetic life for the rest of their lives.

In [[Mongolia]] during the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/mongolia/47.htm Mongolia – Buddhism]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom were killed in the purges of [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan|Choibalsan]].

==Jainism==
{{Main|Jain monasticism}}
One of the most intense forms of Asceticism can be found in [[Jainism]], one of the world's oldest religions. Jainism encourages fasting, yoga practices, meditation in difficult postures, and other austerities.&lt;ref&gt;Frank William Iklé et al. "A History of Asia", page ?. Allyn and Bacon, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jains, one's highest goal should be attaining [[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]] (i.e., liberation from [[samsara]], the cycle of birth and rebirth). For this, a soul has to be without attachment or self-indulgence. This can be achieved only by the monks and nuns who take five great vows: of non-violence, of truth, of non-stealing, of non-possession and of celibacy.
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|[[Acharya Vidyasagar]], a possessionless and detached [[Digambara]] Jain monk]]
Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth "fordmaker" or [[Tirthankara]]. The [[Acaranga Sutra]], or Book of Good Conduct, is a sacred book within Jainism that discusses the ascetic code of conduct. Other texts that provide insight into conduct of ascetics include Yogashastra by Acharya [[Hemachandra]] and Niyamasara by Acharya [[Kundakunda]]. Other illustrious Jain works on ascetic conduct are ''Oghanijjutti, Pindanijjutti, Cheda Sutta, and Nisiha Suttafee.''

Full Jain monk in either [[Svetambara]] or [[Digambara]] tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vallely (2002) ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnography of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto
Press&lt;/ref&gt; can belong to one of these ranks:
* [[Acharya]]: leader of the order
* Upadhyaya: a learned monk, who both teaches and studies himself
* Muni: an ordinary monk

These three are mentioned is the three lines of the [[Namokar Mantra]]. In the [[Digambara]] tradition, a junior monk can be a:
* Ailak: they use one piece of cloth
* [[Kshullak]]: they may use two pieces of cloth

The [[Svetambar Terapanthi]] sect has a new rank of junior monks who are called samana. The nuns are called Aryikas in [[Digambar]] tradition and Sadhvi in the [[Svetambar]] tradition.

===Ascetic vows===
[[File:Mahavratas.jpg|thumb|Five [[Mahavrata]]s of Jain ascetics]]
As per the Jain vows, the monks and nuns renounce all relations and possessions. Jain ascetics practice complete non-violence. ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]'' is the first and foremost vow of a Jain ascetic. They do not hurt any living being, be it an insect or a human. They carry a special broom to sweep away any insects that may cross their path. Some Jain monks wear a cloth over the mouth to prevent accidental harm to airborne germs and insects. They also do not use electricity as it involves violence. Furthermore, they do not use any devices or machines.

As they are without possession and attachment, they travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent themselves from becoming attached to any location. However, during four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as chaturmaas, they continue to stay in a single place to avoid killing the life forms that thrive during the rains.
Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of opposite sex.

===Dietary practices===
Jain ascetics follow a strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables. [[Shvetambara]] monks do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. [[Digambara]] monks have only a single meal a day. Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. Fasting (i.e., abstinence from food and sometimes water) is a routine feature of Jain asceticism. Fasts last for a day or longer, up to a month. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine or hospitalization due to their careful attention to body.

===Austerities and other daily practices===

Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest. Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic. Jain ascetics are (almost) completely without possessions. Some Jains (Shvetambara monks and nuns) own only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment) and a bowl used for eating and collecting alms. Male Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (pinchi) and eat from their hands. They sleep on the floor without blankets and sit on special wooden platforms.

Every day is spent either in study of scriptures or meditation or teaching to lay people. They stand aloof from worldly matters. Many Jain ascetics take a final vow of Santhara or [[Sallekhana]] (i.e., a peaceful and detached death where medicines, food, and water are abandoned). This is done when death is imminent or when a monk feels that he is unable to adhere to his vows on account of advanced age or terminal disease.

Quotes on ascetic practices from the Akaranga Sutra as [[Hermann Jacobi]] translated it:&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi, "[[Sacred Books of the East]]", vol. 22: Gaina Sutras Part I. 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi (1884) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm Jaina Sutras, Part I]. Sacred-texts.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A monk or a nun wandering from village to village should look forward for four cubits, and seeing animals they should move on by walking on his toes or heels or the sides of his feet. If there be some bypath, they should choose it, and not go straight on; then they may circumspectly wander from village to village.|Third Lecture(6)}}

{{quote|I shall become a Sramana who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given.|Seventh Lecture (1)}}

==Vaishnava==
{{Main|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}

Madhvaacharya ([[Madhvacharya]]), the [[Dwaita]] philosopher, established ''[[ashta matha]]'' (Eight Monasteries). He appointed a monk (called ''swamiji'' or ''swamigalu'' in local parlance) for each ''matha'' or monastery who has the right to worship Madhvacharya's [[murti]] of Lord [[Krishna]] by rotation. Each matha's swamiji gets a chance to worship after fourteen years. This ritual is called ''[[Paryaya]]'' and has been used also outside his [[sampradaya]], e.g. in [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] [[Radharamana]] [[temple]] in [[Vrindavan]].

Similar in appearance to Buddhist monks, [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] monks from the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] ([[ISKCON]]), or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] as they are popularly known, are the best known [[Vaishnava]] monks outside India. They are a common sight in many places around the world. Their appearance—simple [[saffron]] ''[[dhoti]]'', shaved head with ''[[sikha]]'', ''[[Tulasi]]'' neckbeads and ''[[tilaka]]'' markings—and social customs (''[[sadhana]]'') date back many thousands of years to the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] era with its ''[[varnasrama]]'' society. This social scheme includes both monastic and lay stages meant for various persons in various stages of life as per their characteristics (''[[guna]]'') and work (''[[karma]]'').

ISKCON started as a predominantly monastic group but nowadays the majority of members live as lay persons. Many of them, however, spent some time as monks. New persons joining ISKCON as full-time members (living in its centers) first undergo a three-month ''[[Bhakta]]'' training, which includes learning the basics of [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] (monastic) life. After that they can decide if they prefer to continue as monks or as married ''[[Grihastha]]s''.

Brahmacari older than fifty years (as per ISKCON rule) can become ''[[sannyasi]]''. ''[[Sannyasa]]'', a life of full dedication to spiritual pursuits, is the highest stage of life in the ''varnasrama'' society. It is permanent and one cannot give it up. A Sannyasi is given the title [[Swami]]. Older grihastha with grown-up children are traditionally expected to accept ''[[vanaprastha]]'' (celibate retired) life.

The role of monastic orders in [[India]]n and now also [[Western world|Western]] society has to some extent been adapted over the years in accordance with ever-changing social structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">The Mount Zion Foundation has its seat at the Institute for Jewish-Christian Research (IJCF) at the University of [[Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]] and grants every other year on October 28 the '''Mount Zion Award'''. In 1986 the Mount Zion Foundation was created by the German Reverend Wilhelm Salberg (1925–1996), son of a Jewish father and a Christian mother. Every other year, this foundation grants the Mount Zion Award to persons of Jewish, Muslim or Christian faith, who have significantly contributed to the Jewish-Christian [[Interfaith dialog|dialogue]] or to the understanding of the three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, in Israel.

The presidents of the foundation, Prof. Dr. Verena Lenzen, director of the Institute for Jewish-Christian Research at the University of Lucerne, and the abbot of the [[Hagia Maria Sion Abbey|Dormition Abbey]] in [[Jerusalem]] Bernhard Maria Alter OSB, present the Mount Zion Award always at the end of October, in remebrance of the Declaration on the Relation of the Catholic Church with Non-Christian Religions ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' of October 28, 1965.

{{Islam}}

A '''Muslim''' ({{lang-ar|مُسلِم}}) is someone who follows or practices [[Islam]], a [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]]. Muslims consider the [[Quran]], their [[holy book]], to be the verbatim word of [[God in Islam|God]] as revealed to the [[Muhammad in Islam|Islamic]] [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger]] [[Muhammad]]. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (''[[sunnah]]'') as recorded in traditional accounts (''[[hadith]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Qurʼan and Sayings of Prophet Muhammad: Selections Annotated &amp; Explained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzx8HlsGnTcC&amp;pg=PR21|accessdate=31 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing|isbn=978-1-59473-222-5|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Muslim" is an [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] meaning "submitter" (to God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|publisher=etymonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150907223337/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of Muslims include: that God ({{lang-ar|الله}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (''[[tawhid]]''); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]];&lt;ref name="People-of-the-Book"/&gt; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (''[[tahrif]]'')&lt;ref name="Distorted"/&gt; and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (Final Testament).&lt;ref&gt;Submission.org, Quran: The Final Testament, Authorized English Version with Arabic Text, Revised Edition IV,{{ISBN|0-9729209-2-7}}, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifier==
The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]: the declaration of faith (''[[shahadah]]''), daily prayers (''[[salat]]''), fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]] (''[[sawm]]''), almsgiving (''[[zakat]]''), and the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (''[[hajj]]'') at least once in a lifetime.&lt;ref name="WSU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the ''[[Shahada]]'', one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], a [[declaration of faith]] and trust that professes that there is [[tawhid|only one]] [[God in Islam|God]] ''([[Allah]])'' and that [[Muhammad]] is God's messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 From the article on the Pillars of Islam in Oxford Islamic Studies Online] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170426134526/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 |date=26 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh'' ({{lang|ar|لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله}})  "There is no god but Allah, (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vHG_VulBdd4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=convert+islam+shahada#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matthew S.

In [[Sunni Islam]], the shahada has two parts: ''la ilaha illa'llah'' (there is no god but [[Allah|God]]), and ''Muhammadun rasul Allah'' ([[Muhammad]] is the messenger of God),&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Lindsay, p.&amp;nbsp;140–141&lt;/ref&gt; which are sometimes referred to as the first ''shahada'' and the second ''shahada''.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; The first statement of the shahada is also known as the ''[[tahlil|tahlīl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Anthony Sells|title=Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYCFTVDDKmkC|year=1999|publisher=White Cloud Press|page=151|isbn=9781883991265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning [[Ali]], the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia Imam]] and the fourth [[Rashidun|Rashid caliph]] of [[Sunni Islam]]: {{lang|ar|وعليٌ وليُّ الله}} ({{transl|ar|DIN|wa ʿalīyyun walīyyu-llāh}}), which translates to "Ali is the ''[[wali]]'' of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Mughals'' by [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]] p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
{{see also|Islam#Etymology and meaning}}
The word ''muslim'' ({{lang-ar|مسلم}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈmʊslɪm|IPA}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|m|ʌ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|s|l|ᵻ|m}} or ''moslem'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|z|l|ə|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|s|l|ə|m}}&lt;ref name="muslim pron" /&gt;) is the [[active participle]] of the same verb of which ''islām'' is a [[verbal noun]], based on the [[triliteral]] ''[[S-L-M]]'' "to be whole, intact".&lt;ref&gt;Burns &amp; Ralph, ''World Civilizations'', 5th ed., p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''šlm'', p. 2067, Appendix B: Semitic Roots, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th ed., Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2000, {{ISBN|0-618-08230-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A female adherent is a ''muslima'' ({{lang-ar|مسلمة}}) (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Muslimah"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah Muslimah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817020605/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah |date=17 August 2016 }}. ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ). The plural form in Arabic is ''muslimūn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمون}}) or ''muslimīn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمين}}), and its feminine equivalent is ''muslimāt'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمات}}). The Arabic form ''muslimun'' is the stem IV [[Arabic grammar#Participle|participle]]{{refn|group=note|name=participle|also known as "infinitive"}} of the triliteral ''S-L-M''.

The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". It is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Moslem", which is an older spelling.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The word ''Mosalman'' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}, alternatively ''Mussalman'') is a common equivalent for ''Muslim'' used in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term ''[[Mohammedan]]s'' or ''Mahometans''.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the second edition of ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage|A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' by [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]], revised by [[Ernest Gowers]] (Oxford, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be [[pejorative]], Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Gibb| first = Sir Hamilton| title = Mohammedanism: an historical survey| year = 1969| page=1 | quote=Modern Muslims dislike the terms Mohammedan and Mohammedanism, which seem to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsolete terms include ''Muslimite''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Muslimite}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Muslimist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Tahir|title=Muslim Britain: Communities Under Pressure|date=2005|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musulmán'''/'''Mosalmán''' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}) is a synonym for ''Muslim'' and is modified from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It is the origin of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''{{lang|es|musulmán}}'', the (dated) [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Muselmann}}'', the French word ''musulman'', the [[Polish language|Polish]] words ''{{lang|pl|muzułmanin}}'' and ''{{lang|pl|muzułmański}}'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''{{lang|pt|muçulmano}}'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''{{lang|it|mussulmano}}'' or ''{{lang|it|musulmano}}'', the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''musulman'' and the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|μουσουλμάνος}} (all used for a Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm Musalman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104031529/http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm |date=4 January 2007 }} – Internet Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt; In English it was sometimes spelled '''Mussulman''' and has become [[Archaism|archaic]] in usage.

Apart from Persian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, and Greek, the term could be found, with obvious local differences, in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Panjabi language|Panjabi]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

==Meaning==
The Muslim philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] said:

{{Quote|A Muslim is a person who has dedicated his worship exclusively to God...''Islam'' means making one's religion and faith God's alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Qur'an'', Razi, I, p. 432, Cairo, 1318/1900&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other prophets===
The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Jacob]], [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], and [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] and his [[apostles]] are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (''wa-shahad be anna muslimūn'')." In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the [[Tawrat]] ([[Torah]]) to Moses, the [[Zabur]] ([[Psalms]]) to [[David]] and the [[Injil]] ([[Gospel]]) to Jesus, who are all considered important [[Prophets of Islam|Muslim prophets]].

{{wiktionary}}
A '''novice''' is a person or creature who is new to a field or activity. It can be seen as a person who has entered a religious order and is under probation, before taking vows. Additionally, it can be an animal, especially a racehorse, that has not yet won a major prize or reached a level of performance to qualify for important events.

==Religion==
===Buddhism===
[[File:NovicesWangdue.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Buddhist novices in Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, [[Bhutan]]]]

{{main|Buddhist Novitiate}}

In many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] orders, a man or woman who intends to take ordination must first become a novice, adopting part of the monastic code indicated in the [[vinaya]] and studying in preparation for full ordination.  The name for this level of ordination varies from one tradition to another.  In Pali, the word is [[samanera]], which means 'small monk' or 'boy monk'.

===Christianity===
====Roman Catholicism====
{{main|Catholic novitiate}}
A novice in [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon law]] and [[tradition]], is a ''prospective'' member of a [[religious order]] who is being tried and being proven for suitability of admission to a religious order of priests, religious brothers, or religious sisters, whether the community is one of [[monk]]s or has an "active" ministry. After initial contact with the community, and usually a period of time as a [[postulant]] (a more or less formal period of candidacy for the [[novitiate]]), the person will be received as a novice in a ceremony that most often involves being clothed with the [[religious habit]] (traditional garb) of the particular religious community. The novice's habit is often slightly different from those of professed members of the order. For instance, in communities of women that wear a dark [[veil]] over the head, novices often wear a white one; among [[Franciscan]] communities of men, novices wear an additional shirt-like chest piece over the traditional Franciscan robe; [[Carthusian]] novices wear a dark cloak over the usual white habit; etc.

Novices are not admitted to [[religious vows|vows]] until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the [[novitiate]]. This usually lasts one year, the minimum required by Canon Law, though in some orders and communities it is two. Novices typically have dormitories in separate areas within a [[monastery]] or community and are under the direct supervision of a [[novice master]] or novice mistress.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====
{{main|Degrees_of_Orthodox_monasticism#Novice|l1=Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: Novice}}
In the [[Orthodox Church]], a candidate may be clothed as a novice ([[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: послушник, ''poslushnik'', literally "one under obedience") by the [[hegumen]] ([[abbot]]) or hegumenia ([[abbess]]) after at least three days in the monastery. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) is simply given the [[Cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox and Eastern Catholic)|riassa]], belt and [[skoufos]]. Novice [[nun]]s additionally wear a veil ([[apostolnik]]) that covers the head and neck. A novice is also given a [[prayer rope]] and instructed in the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. In large communities, the new novice may be assigned a [[starets]] (spiritual father or spiritual mother) who will guide his spiritual development. Frequent [[Confession (religion)#Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism|confession of sins]] and participation in the [[sacred mysteries]] (sacraments) of the church is an important part of Orthodox monastic life.

A novice is free to leave the monastery at any time, and the superior is also free to dismiss the novice at any time if, for instance, he or she feels the novice is not called to monasticism or if there have been discipline issues. If, however, the novice perseveres, after a period of around three years the hegumen may choose to clothe him in the first (beginning) rank of monasticism: the [[rassaphore]].

==Sports==
In [[National Hunt racing]], a [[Novice (racehorse)|novice]] is a horse that has not won a race under a particular code (either [[National Hunt racing#Types of race|chasing or hurdling]]) before the current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2805685.stm|title=National Hunt races|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 February 2010 | date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[figure skating competition]]s, novice has two meanings. For the [[U.S. Figure Skating]] Association, it refers to a skill level, while the [[International Skating Union]] uses it to designate age.

Novice is a level of [[Minor hockey#Canada|minor hockey in Canada]]. Novice players are usually between the ages of 7 and 8.

In the sport of crew ([[rowing (sport)|rowing]]), the term is used for an athlete in their first year of competition.

In many sports, a novice athlete competing in their first season or league is often referred to as a [[rookie]], and outstanding novice athletes can win [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]].

==Online Communities==
With the rise of the internet, a novice is a person who is a newcomer to a particular website, forum, or other social community. These people are usually inexperienced and unfamiliar with the traditions and protocols surrounding that community.

Thus, it's a difficult task for online communities to get novices to contribute. One way to make novices contribute is to make them feel unique which makes them want to contribute. In a study at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], researchers looked at whether reminding users of their history of rating rarely-rated movies at MovieLens.com increased their contributions.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=hcii|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University Research Showcase : Human-Computer Interaction Institute School of Computer Science|date=2004|title=Using Social Psychology to Motivate Contributions to Online Communities|author1=Gerard Beenen|author2=Kimberly Ling|author3=Xiaoquin Wang|author4=Klarissa Chang|author5=Dan Frankowski|website=Repository.cmu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that reminding users of their uniqueness increased their willingness to contribute.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"/&gt; The study also looked at whether goal-setting could help users contribute more to the community. The study found that users with specific goals contributed more than users with a do-your-best goal.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"/&gt;

Slang terms include "newbie" and the more derogatory "noob." [[Newbie]] is mostly used as a descriptor or qualifier, a name given to novices by more experienced users or community members to indicate someone who just entered the community and is eager to learn and participate. Noob is a word used to insult or deride novices who are disrespectful, uninterested, or unwilling to learn.

In gamer culture, a newbie is an inexperienced player with a low level, rank, or in-game abilities but wants to participate and improve, and a noob is a bad player who seems disinterested in learning or teamwork and [[internet troll|trolls]] other players.

=== Dealing With Newcomers === 
Online communities have five basic problems regarding newcomers: recruitment, selection, retention, socialization, and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recruitment]] in online communities is about advertising to recruits and ensuring there is a healthy amount of newcomers because without newcomers, online communities can fail to survive. There many different methods that online communities use to recruit new members. For example, Blizzard entertainment used both impersonal advertisement (TV, print, online advertisement) and interpersonal advertisement (recruit-a-friend promotion) to recruit new players for [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers will be a good fit in the community. This is very important because a better fit is more likely to be beneficial for the community, since better fit newcomers stay in the group longer when they join and are more satisfied with their membership. One way that selection works in online communities is through the process of self-selection, in which the potential members decide themselves to join a community based on the information about the community available to them. Another way of selection is through screening, in which the community selects certain members who they believe will be a good fit.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers stick around and stay long enough to become more committed members, who take on more important responsibilities and begin to be identify themselves with the group. One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment. For example, in World of Warcraft, newcomers have to play with other guild members for at least about a month to join.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socialization]] in online communities about the rest of community interacting with newcomer and teaching them the guidelines and standards of the community. For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], old member show the newcomers ropes, by coaching them, helping them with quests,and providing mentorship in general.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection in online communities is about protecting the community from the newcomers. Since newcomers still have not established themselves with the group or still may be unfamiliar with the norms of the community, the rest of the community has to beware of the potential damage that they can cause. One way to deal with the threats is through the use of sandboxes, which allows newcomers to try out the features and learn about the tools without causing damage to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Episcopal Church''' (OEC) is a liberal Christian denomination. It has bishops in England and Wales and clergy throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. It has over 29,000 members.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/organisation.html Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was the first in Britain to ordain a woman as bishop and to perform religious wedding ceremonies for gay couples.

The OEC is a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]], which in turn is a member of The [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].

==History==
=== Founding of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry ===
In 1994 Jonathan Blake, who had been a priest in the [[Church of England]] for over 12 years, effected a Deed of Relinquishment,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/91/section/3&lt;/ref&gt; severing his denominational ties. 

As an independent priest&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/have-dog-collar-will-travel-counselling-dance-workshops-conflict-resolution-arbitration-exorcism----jim-white-meets-the-countrys-first-freelance-vicar-1444165.html The Independent - on 'Country's first freelance vicar'.]&lt;/ref&gt; he offered sacramental ministry to all. In 1997 he wrote about these experiences in his book, ''For God's Sake Don't Go To Church''.&lt;ref name="For God's Sake Don't Go To Church"&gt;For God's Sake Don't Go To Church {{ISBN|0-85305-446-0}} Published by Arthur James.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he nailed 95 theses&lt;ref name="95 Theses"&gt;[http://www.bishopjonathanblake.com/theses.htm 95 Theses]&lt;/ref&gt; to the door of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], for which he was arrested but not charged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesbian from the north of England arranged to meet Blake after reading his book. She felt a call to the ministry but had been rebuffed by the church over her sexuality and was interested in independent ministry. Following the meeting Blake placed an advert in the ''[[Church Times]]'' inviting all those interested in such a ministry to a conference the following March. Over 100 people contacted him, among them Richard Palmer,&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[http://www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxv1/europe1.htm Richard Palmer]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been consecrated as a bishop of the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] in 1997, but had resigned in April 1999. 

Blake wrote the Founding Principles&lt;ref name="The Founding Principles"&gt;[http://www.sicm.eu/736.html The Founding Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry (SICM), which was inaugurated by a group of Christians reciting the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in the Sanctum of the Holy Circle Trust&lt;ref name="The Holy Circle Trust"&gt;The Holy Circle Trust. Charity Number 1066062&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Ryarsh]] in [[Kent]] at sunrise on 1 January 2000.

In February 2001, Blake conducted the first gay wedding blessing on Richard and Judy's prime time TV programme ''This Morning''.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1170214.stm BBC News - Gay Wedding on Richard and Judy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding of the Open Episcopal Church ===

By the time SICM met for the third time in Bournemouth, Palmer required those who had been ordained simply in Dartford to be ordained ''sub conditione'' at this gathering in a full rite of ordination. Blake realized that a new denomination had to be founded and set about writing the necessary canons.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

At [[Hazlewood Castle]], Michael Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/archive/2004/08/07/Lancashire+Archive/5825155.Rent_a_bishop_at_your_service Michael Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop by Palmer and Blake. The three bishops issued the "Hazlewood Declaration" on 10 November 2001, which facilitated the creation of the Open Episcopal Church. The church viewed itself as being in succession from the [[Old Catholic Church]], which had been established in England in 1908 by [[Arnold Mathew]] from See of Utrecht and continued through the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/about/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, the Society of Independent Christian Ministry and the Open Episcopal Church coexisted, but the differences between them made this untenable, and at Liverpool in October 2002 it was decided finally that thereafter they should separate, following  similar paths, and containing many of  the same people, but with two distinct approaches.

The first significant meeting of the College of Bishops of the Open Episcopal Church took place in London in July 2002, prior to the separation of the Open Episcopal Church and the Society for Independent Christian Ministry at Liverpool in October of that year.

[[Elizabeth Stuart (theologian)|Elizabeth Stuart]] was consecrated as a bishop at the Royal Holloway Chapel, the college chapel of the [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, the University of London, Egham]] in Surrey, in April 2003. This was the first consecration of a woman as an independent Catholic bishop in the UK. 

The first congress of the church was held at the [[All Saints Pastoral Centre]] in June 2004. The church's college of bishops met at Weston Manor in Oxfordshire in January 2005 and Wilson, an evangelical, resigned from the Church. The second congress was held at [[Whaley Hall]] at Whaley Bridge in mid 2005. In October, Roger Whatley&lt;ref name="Whatley"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=75762 Roger Whatley]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop in the Chapel of the [[Ammerdown House, Kilmersdon|Ammerdown Conference Centre]].

===Development===
The church has had three archbishops: Richard Palmer, who left the church along with Roger Whatley after the allotted five-years of Palmer's tenure as archbishop ended; Elizabeth Stuart, who left the church in 2006 and was appointed the Archbishop of the Province of Great Britain and Ireland of the more traditionalist [[Liberal Catholic Church International]]; and Jonathan Blake, OEC's founder, who was the church's sole remaining bishop after Stuart left.

In 2008 the Open Episcopal Church became a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]] and through them, a member of the [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].&lt;ref name="ICCCC"&gt;[http://www.icccnow.org/Europe/  ICCCC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church received national and international attention due to the wedding blessing Blake conducted for [[reality television]] figures [[Jade Goody]] and [[Jack Tweed]],&lt;ref name="Jade Goody's Wedding"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4779170/Jade-Goodys-wedding-The-final-preparations.html Jade Goody's Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Wedding"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1150757/Roof-stunt-archbishop-line-conduct-Jades-wedding.html Daily Mail - Goody's wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damian Thomspon's blog"&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/8679611/Jade_Goody_Archbishop_Blake_and_the_strange_phenomenon_of_wandering_bishops Damian Thompson's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; through interviews broadcast after Jade Goody's  death,&lt;ref name="After death"&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/video/11383/news/Bishop-praises-Jade/#36029 Talk Talk News Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; through the prayer released before Jade Goody's funeral,&lt;ref name="Prayer"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/04/03/jade-goody-s-funeral-what-the-star-planned-for-her-last-journey-115875-21249010 Prayer for Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through Blake's response to [[Michael Parkinson]]'s criticism of Goody,&lt;ref name="Criticism of Jade"&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Bishop-Jonathan-Blake-Hits-Back-At-Sir-Michael-Parkinsons-Criticism/Article/200904215258069 Sky News - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Criticism"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/jade-goody/5123450/Bishop-hits-back-at-Sir-Michael-Parkinson-comments-on-Jade-Goody.html Daily Telegraph - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/08/jade-goody-s-wedding-bishop-defends-her-against-sir-michael-parkinson-s-criticism-115875-21263483 Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through the launch of Post the Host (an outreach provision to distribute the consecrated Hosts by post),&lt;ref&gt;

Following Jade Goody's wedding, Christopher Woods, Chaplain and Director of Studies in Theology at Christ's College, Cambridge, called upon the Church of England to speak out against Blake and the OEC. The Church of England declined to comment.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5786676.ece Revd Woods criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church consecrated the first woman as a bishop for Wales in 2007.&lt;ref name="Female Bishops"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/then-there-were-four.html  Female Bishops.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop of Scotland, David Gillham, ordained Helen Hamilton at St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney in 2010; Gillham later fell into dispute with the church and left.&lt;ref name="Pluralist"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/more-on-oec.html  Pluralist.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Reader"&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-herald/20120402/282376921549061  Press Reader.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton was subsequently consecrated as the first woman bishop for Scotland in June 2012.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13060905.Nun_made_Scotland_s_first_bishop/  Sunday Herald.]&lt;/ref&gt; She made an episcopal visit to Londonderry.&lt;ref name="Londonderry"&gt;[http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/bishop-helen-makes-first-visit-to-the-city-1-4269686  Londonderry.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the church consecrated a female bishop for Northumberland.&lt;ref name="Northumberland"&gt;[http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/female-bishop-for-northumberland-1-2740373  Northumberland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake contributed to the book ''A Strange Vocation: Independent Bishops Tell Their Stories'' in 2009,&lt;ref name="A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories"&gt;A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories {{ISBN|1-933993-75-8}} Published by Apocryphile Press&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed liturgical material to Geoffrey Duncan's anthology ''Courage to Love''&lt;ref name="Courage to Love"&gt;Courage to Love {{ISBN|0-8298-1468-X}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Leanne Tigert and Maren Tirabassi's compilation ''All Whom God Has Joined''.&lt;ref name="All Whom God has Joined"&gt;All Whom God has Joined {{ISBN|0-8298-1838-3}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Blake's book ''That Old Devil Called God Again: The Scourge of Religion'' was published.&lt;ref name="Publisher"&gt;[http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake Publisher.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has clerics from Anglican, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, Lutheran and Franciscan backgrounds and has grown internationally into America, Egypt, Brazil and Thailand.&lt;ref name="International"&gt;[https://allsaintschiangmai.com/2013/06/  International.]&lt;/ref&gt; The church promotes its KITE Awards for young people making a positive difference in the community.&lt;ref name="KITE Awards"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/kite.html  KITE Awards.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norfolk Network"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/pdf/NetworkNorwichKITEArticle.pdf  Norfolk Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perennial philosophy''' ({{lang-la|philosophia perennis}}),{{refn|group=note| more fully, ''philosophia perennis et universalis''; sometimes shortened to ''sophia perennis'' or ''religio perennis''}} also referred to as '''perennialism''' and '''perennial wisdom''', is a perspective in modern spirituality that views each of the world's religious traditions as sharing a single, metaphysical truth or origin from which all esoteric and exoteric knowledge and doctrine has grown.

Perennialism has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}

A more popular interpretation argues for [[universalism]], the idea that all religions, underneath seeming differences point to the same Truth. In the early 19th century the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] propagated the idea of a metaphysical Truth and universalism, which inspired the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], who proselytized among Indian elites. Towards the end of the 19th century, the [[Theosophical Society]] further popularized universalism, not only in the western world, but also in western colonies. In the 20th century universalism was further popularized in the English-speaking world through the [[neo-Vedanta]] inspired Traditionalist School, which argues for a metaphysical, single origin of the orthodox religions, and by [[Aldous Huxley]] and his book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which was inspired by [[neo-Vedanta]] and the Traditionalist School.

==Definition==

===Renaissance===
The idea of a perennial philosophy originated with a number of [[Renaissance]] theologians who took inspiration from [[neo-Platonism]] and from the [[theory of Forms]]. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the [[Theory of Forms|realm of ideas]].{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 508}} According to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494), a student of Ficino, truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 513}} According to [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 517}}

===Traditionalist School===
The contemporary, scholarly oriented [[Traditionalist School]] continues this metaphysical orientation. According to the Traditionalist School, the perennial philosophy is "absolute Truth and infinite Presence."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Absolute Truth is "the perennial wisdom (''sophia perennis'') that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Infinite Presence is "the perennial religion (''religio perennis'') that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} The Traditionalist School discerns a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or [[absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional "mystical concentration on the Real."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xiii}}

According to Soares de Azevedo, the perennialist philosophy states that the universal truth is the same within each of the world's orthodox religious traditions, and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine. Each world religion is an interpretation of this universal truth, adapted to cater for the psychological, intellectual, and social needs of a given culture of a given period of history. This perennial truth has been rediscovered in each epoch by [[Mysticism|mystics]] of all kinds who have revived already existing religions, when they had fallen into empty platitudes and hollow ceremonialism.{{sfn|Soares de Azevedo|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

Shipley further notes that the Traditionalist School is oriented on orthodox traditions, and rejects modern syncretism and universalism, which creates new religions from older religions and compromise the standing traditions.{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}}

===Aldous Huxley and mystical universalism===
One such universalist was Aldous Huxley,{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}} who propagated a universalist interpretation of the world religions, inspired by Vivekananda's [[neo-Vedanta]]. According to Aldous Huxley, who popularized the idea of a perennial philosophy with a larger audience,
{{quote|The Perennial Philosophy is expressed most succinctly in the Sanskrit formula, [[tat tvam asi]] ('That thou art'); the Atman, or immanent eternal Self, is one with Brahman, the Absolute Principle of all existence; and the last end of every human being, is to discover the fact for himself, to find out who he really is.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

In Huxley's 1944 essay in ''Vedanta and the West'', he describes ''The Minimum Working Hypothesis''; the basic outline of the perennial philosophy found in all the mystic branches of the religions of the world:

{{quote| That there is a Godhead or Ground, which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestation.

That the Ground is transcendent and immanent.

That it is possible for human beings to love, know and, from virtually, to become actually identified with the Ground.

That to achieve this unitive knowledge, to realize this supreme identity, is the final end and purpose of human existence.

That there is a Law or Dharma, which must be obeyed, a Tao or Way, which must be followed, if men are to achieve their final end.|}}

==Origins==
{{Main|Neo-Platonism|Agape}}

The perennial philosophy originates from a blending of neo-Platonism and [[Christianity]]. Neo-Platonism itself has diverse origins in the syncretic culture of the [[Hellenistic period]], and was an influential philosophy throughout the Middle Ages.

===Classical world===

====Hellenistic period: religious syncretism====
{{See also|Religious syncretism}}

During the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaigns]] brought about exchange of cultural ideas on its path throughout most of the known world of his era. The Greek [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries]] mixed with such influences as the [[Cult of Isis]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Indo-Greeks|Hinduism]], along with some Persian influences. Such [[cross-cultural]] exchange was not new to the Greeks; the [[Egyptian god]] Osiris and the [[Greek god]] Dionysus had been equated as [[Osiris-Dionysus]] by the historian Herodotus as early as the 5th century BC (see [[Interpretatio graeca]]).{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1966|p=188-192}}{{sfn|McEvilley|2002}}

====Roman world: Philo of Alexandria====
[[Philo]] of Alexandria (c.25 BCE – c.50 CE) attempted to reconcile Greek Rationalism with the Torah, which helped pave the way for Christianity with [[Neo-Platonism]], and the adoption of the Old Testament with Christianity, as opposed to Gnostic Marcion roots of Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Philo translated [[Judaism]] into terms of [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] elements, and held that God is "supra rational" and can be reached only through "ecstasy." He also held that the [[oracles]] of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge.

====Neo-Platonism====
{{Main|Neoplatonism}}

Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and persisted until shortly after the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in Athens in AD 529 by [[Justinian I]]. Neoplatonists were heavily influenced by [[Plato]], but also by the Platonic tradition that thrived during the six centuries which separated the first of the Neoplatonists from Plato. The work of Neoplatonic philosophy involved describing the derivation of the whole of reality from a single principle, "the One." It was founded by [[Plotinus]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/ ''IEP'']&lt;/ref&gt; and has been very influential throughout history. In the [[Middle Ages]], Neoplatonic ideas were integrated into the philosophical and theological works of many of the most important medieval Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thinkers.

===Renaissance===

====Ficino and Pico della Mirandola====
[[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) believed that [[Hermes Trismegistos]], the supposed author of the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', was a contemporary of Mozes and the teacher of [[Pythagoras]], and the source of both Greek and Jewish-Christian thought.{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} He argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas. Platonic Philosophy and Christian theology both embody this truth. Ficino was influenced by a variety of philosophers including Aristotelian [[Scholasticism]] and various pseudonymous and mystical writings. Ficino saw his thought as part of a long development of philosophical truth, of ancient pre-Platonic philosophers (including [[Zoroaster]], [[Hermes Trismegistus]], [[Orpheus]], Aglaophemus and [[Pythagoras]]) who reached their peak in Plato. The [[Prisca theologia]], or venerable and ancient theology, which embodied the truth and could be found in all ages, was a vitally important idea for Ficino.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}}

[[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94), a student of Ficino, went further than his teacher by suggesting that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. This proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] among other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} After the deaths of Pico and Ficino this line of thought expanded, and included [[Symphorien Champier]], and [[Francesco Giorgio]].

====Steuco====

=====De perenni philosophia libri X=====
The term ''perenni philosophia'' was first used by [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) who used it to title a treatise, ''De perenni philosophia libri X'', published in 1540.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}} ''De perenni philosophia'' was the most sustained attempt at philosophical synthesis and harmony.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=515}} Steuco represents the liberal wing of 16th-century Biblical scholarship and theology, although he rejected Luther and Calvin.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} ''De perenni philosophia'', is a complex work which only contains the term philosophia perennis twice. It states that there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;''De perenni philosophia Bk 1'', Ch 1; folio 1 in Schmitt (1966) P.517&lt;/ref&gt; This single knowledge (or sapientia) is the key element in his philosophy. In that he emphasises continuity over progress, Steuco's idea of philosophy is not one conventionally associated with the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, he tends to believe that the truth is lost over time and is only preserved in the [[Prisca theologia|prisci theologica]]. Steuco preferred Plato to Aristotle and saw greater congruence between the former and Christianity than the latter philosopher. He held that philosophy works in harmony with religion and should lead to knowledge of God, and that truth flows from a single source, more ancient than the Greeks. Steuco was strongly influenced by [[Iamblichus]]'s statement that knowledge of God is innate in all,&lt;ref&gt;''Jamblichi De mysteriis liber'', ed. Gustavus Parthey (Berlin), I, 3; 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave great importance to Hermes Trismegistus.

=====Influence=====
Steuco's perennial philosophy was highly regarded by some scholars for the two centuries after its publication, then largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by Otto Willmann in the late part of the 19th century.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} Overall, ''De perenni philosophia'' wasn't particularly influential, and largely confined to those with a similar orientation to himself. The work was not put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] of works banned by the Roman Catholic Church, although his ''Cosmopoeia'' which expressed similar ideas was. Religious criticisms tended to the conservative view that held Christian teachings should be understood as unique, rather than seeing them as perfect expressions of truths that are found everywhere.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=527}} More generally, this philosophical [[syncretism]] was set out at the expense of some of the doctrines included within it, and it is possible that Steuco's critical faculties were not up to the task he had set himself. Further, placing so much confidence in the prisca theologia, turned out to be a shortcoming as many of the texts used in this school of thought later turned out to be bogus.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=524}} In the following two centuries the most favourable responses were largely Protestant and often in England.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] later picked up on Steuco's term. The German philosopher stands in the tradition of this concordistic philosophy; his [[Pre-established harmony|philosophy of harmony]] especially had affinity with Steuco's ideas. Leibniz knew about Steuco's work by 1687, but thought that ''De la Verite de la Religion Chretienne'' by Huguenot philosopher [[Phillippe du Plessis-Mornay]] expressed the same truth better. Steuco's influence can be found throughout Leibniz's works, but the German was the first philosopher to refer to the perennial philosophy without mentioning the Italian.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=530-531}}

==Popularisation==

===Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism===
{{Main|Transcendentalism|Universalism}}

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the major figures in [[Transcendentalism]], an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement, which was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopdeia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;[http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; They also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophical Society===
{{main|Theosophical Society}}

By the end of the 19th century, the idea of a perennial philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as [[H. P. Blavatsky]] and [[Annie Besant]], under the name of "Wisdom-Religion" or "Ancient Wisdom".&lt;ref name="key"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions, subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan.

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta|Hinduism in the West|Neo-Advaita}}

Many perennialist thinkers (including Armstrong, Huston Smith and [[Joseph Campbell]]) are influenced by Hindu reformer [[Ram Mohan Roy]] and Hindu mystics [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero p.166&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism.{{sfn|King|2002}} They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this perennial philosophy. This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 20th century.{{sfn|King|2002}}

The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 19th century, who in turn influenced many 20th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers. Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins. [[Ram Mohan Roy]], a philosopher and the founder of the modernising [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious organisation, reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it.

The mystic [[Ramakrishna]]'s spiritual ecstasies included experiencing the sameness of Christ, Mohammed and his own Hindu deity. Ramakrishna's most famous disciple, [[Swami Vivekananda]], travelled to the United States in the 1890s where he formed the [[Vedanta Society]].

Roy, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen (2010) ''God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World—and Why Their Differences Matter'', p. 165-6, HarperOne, {{ISBN|0-06-157127-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002}}

===Traditionalist School===
{{Main|Traditionalist School}}

The Traditionalist School was a group of 20th century thinkers concerned with what they considered to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]].  Other important thinkers in this tradition include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Jean Borella]], [[Elémire Zolla]]. According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the "philosophia perennis" designates a worldview that is opposed to the [[scientism]] of modern [[secular]] societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular [[developed world]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This view is exemplified by [[Rene Guenon]] in his ''magnum opus'' and one of the founding works of the [[traditionalist school]], ''[[The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times]]''.

According to [[Frithjof Schuon]]:
{{quote|It has been said more than once that total Truth is inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of our spirit; what the different Revelations do is to "crystallize" and "actualize", in different degrees according to the case, a nucleus of certitudes which not only abides forever in the divine Omniscience, but also sleeps by refraction in the "naturally supernatural" kernel of the individual, as well as in that of each ethnic or historical collectivity or of the human species as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Writings of Frithjof Schuon,'' Suhayl Academy, Lahore, 2001, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aldous Huxley===
{{See also|The Perennial Philosophy}}

The term was popularized in more recent times by [[Aldous Huxley]], who was profoundly influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]].{{sfn|Roy|2003}} In his 1945 book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' he defined the perennial philosophy as:
{{quote|... the [[metaphysic]] that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical to, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]]; the thing is immemorial and universal. Rudiments of the perennial philosophy may be found among the traditional lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions.{{sfn|Huxley|1945|p=vii}}}}

In contrast to the Traditionalist school, Huxley emphasized [[mystical experience]] over metaphysics:
{{quote|The Buddha declined to make any statement in regard to the ultimate divine Reality. All he would talk about was Nirvana, which is the name of the [[Phenomenology of religion|experience that comes to]] the totally selfless and one-pointed [...] Maintaining, in this matter, the attitude of a strict operationalist, the Buddha would speak only of the spiritual experience, not of the metaphysical entity presumed by the theologians of other religions, as also of later Buddhism, to be the object and (since in contemplation the knower, the known and the knowledge are all one) at the same time the subject and substance of that experience.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

According to Aldous Huxley, in order to apprehend the divine reality, one must choose to fulfill certain conditions: "making themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that very few people can achieve this state.  Those who have fulfilled these conditions, grasped the universal truth and interpreted it have generally been given the name of saint, prophet, sage or enlightened one.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that those who have, "modified their merely human mode of being," and have thus been able to comprehend "more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge" have also achieved this enlightened state.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age===
{{Main|New Age|New Age Movement}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy is central to the New Age Movement. The New Age movement is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=12}} The term ''New Age'' refers to the coming [[astrological age|astrological]] [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"/&gt;

The New Age aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=8}} It holds to "a holistic worldview",{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=11}} emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"&gt;Melton, J. Gordon – Director Institute for the Study of American Religion.

[http://www.csj.org/rg/rgessays/rgessay_newage.htm What Is "New Age"?], retrieved 2006-07&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality"{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=10}} and embraces a number of forms of [[mainstream science]] as well as other forms of science that are considered [[Fringe science|fringe]].

==Academic discussions==

===Mystical experience===
{{Main|Mystical experience}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy, sometimes called perennialism, is a key area of debate in the academic discussion of mystical experience. Huston Smith notes that the Traditionalist School's vision of a perennial philosophy is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions.{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} The discussion of mystical experience has shifted the emphasis in the perennial philosophy from these metaphysical intuitions to religious experience{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} and the notion of [[nonduality]] or [[altered state of consciousness]].

[[William James]] popularized the use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge.&lt;ref group=web name="StanfordMysticism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Walter Terence Stace|WT Stace]], [[Huston Smith]], and [[Robert K.C. Forman|Robert Forman]] argue that there are core similarities to mystical experience across religions, cultures and eras.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Wesley J. (2010) ''Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future for the Philosophy of Religion'', p. 49, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|1-4384-3235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stace the universality of this core experience is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for one to be able to trust the cognitive content of any religious experience.{{sfn|Prothero|2010|p=6}}{{check source|date=February 2017}}

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}

Critics point out that the emphasis on "experience" favours the atomic individual, instead of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process, embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=4-5}} Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism - that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences - serves to exclude it from political issues such as social justice. Mysticism thus comes to be seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than serving to transform the world, reconcile the individual to the status quo by alleviating anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

===Religious pluralism===
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}

[[Religious pluralism]] holds that various world religions are limited by their distinctive historical and cultural contexts and thus there is no single, true religion.  There are only many equally valid religions. Each religion is a direct result of humanity's attempt to grasp and understand the incomprehensible divine reality. Therefore, each religion has an authentic but ultimately inadequate perception of divine reality, producing a partial understanding of the universal truth, which requires syncretism to achieve a complete understanding as well as a path towards salvation or spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James. "Religious Pluralism and the Question of Religious Truth in Wilfred C. Smith." The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory 4, no. 3 (2003): pp.58-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although perennial philosophy also holds that there is no single true religion, it differs when discussing divine reality. Perennial philosophy states that the divine reality is what allows the universal truth to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, John Stephen. "Perennial Philosophy and Christianity." In Christianity: the complete guide . London: Continuum, 2005. pp.1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each religion provides its own interpretation of the universal truth, based on its historical and cultural context.  Therefore, each religion provides everything required to observe the divine reality and achieve a state in which one will be able to confirm the universal truth and achieve salvation or spiritual enlightenment.

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

The '''Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding''' ('''ACMCU''') is an interfaith institution based at the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Overview==
The institution was founded at [[Georgetown University]] in 1993 as the '''Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding'''. It is housed within the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Caryle Murphy, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121200591.html Saudi Gives $20 Million to Georgetown], ''Washington Post'' (December 13, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a wealthy Saudi [[House of Saud|Saudi prince]] and businessman, [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] in 2005, gave $20 million to the Center to promote interfaith understanding and the study of Islam and the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; The center was renamed in his honor.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafferty"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/saudi-prince-gives-gu-20m/ |title= Saudi Prince Gives GU $20M |first= Steve |last= Rafferty |date= January 12, 2006|work= [[The Hoya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $20 million gift was the second-largest ever given to the Georgetown at that point.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Bin Talal simultaneously gave $20 million to [[Harvard University]]'s interdisciplinary Islamic studies program and $15 million to establish [[American studies]] programs at the [[American University in Beirut]] and [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

The founding director of the center was [[John Esposito]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 Press Release: Georgetown University Receives $20 Million Gift From Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal To Expand Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904131933/http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 |date=2006-09-04 }}, December 12, 2005.  Accessed 24 November, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito was succeeded by John O. Voll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pluralism.org/profiles/view/74161 Center Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (2005)], Pluralism Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is co-publisher (with the UK's [[Birmingham University]] Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations) of the journal ''Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17357/ISIM_4_The_Center_for_Muslim-Christian_Understanding-History_and_International_Affairs.pdf?sequence=1 Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] questioned the prince's gift, and whether the center had ever been critical of the Saudi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/14/AR2008021403487.html?hpid=sec-education |title= $20 Million Saudi Gift Is Questioned |first= Valerie |last= Strauss |work = [[The Washington Post]] |date= February 15, 2008 |accessdate= 2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic debate, political ideologies that resemble religion are sometimes referred to as [[political religion]]s.

While the more serious-minded participants in these groups may prefer to consider themselves part of a proper religion, or not part of a religion at all, the mainstream ascribes to them a fringe status. Such groups as the [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Raëlian Church]] and [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], seen as dangerous, exploitative, secretive, or closed, have been classified as pseudoreligious [[cult]]s.

Others may begin as splinters or hold-overs from traditional religions based in [[Apocryphal]] or [[Pseudepigraphical]] writings not accepted within the originating religion.

Examples of marginal movements with founding figures, liturgies and recently invented traditions that have been studied as legitimate social practices include various [[New Age]] movements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">A '''religious reform''' (from Latin ''re'': back, again, and ''formare'': to form; i.e. put together: ''to restore, reconstruct, or rebuild'') aims at the reform of religious teachings. It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.

== Definition ==

Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Johnstone: [https://books.google.de/books/about/Religion_in_Society.html?id=11LuAAAAMAAJ Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion], Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: ''re-formare'', reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for [[ethics|ethical]] prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.religion1 My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror], in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: "If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a "final" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by [[Karl Barth]] in 1947: ''[[Ecclesia semper reformanda est]]'', i.e. ''The church is always to be reformed.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mahlmann: ''Ecclesia semper reformanda''. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbjörn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|restore paganism as state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of ''[[Aggiornamento]]'' in the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. title of: J. Schacht: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282132 Modernism and Traditionalism in a History of Islamic Law], in:  Middle Eastern Studies Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul., 1965), pp. 388-400&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature. What ensues is an ethic, rather than a short-term policy or technological fix.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When never-ending consumption patterns cease for the betterment of the world as a whole, then all systems will harmoniously interact in a non-abusive way.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J. Roemer]], the [[Dalai Lama]] urged the U.S to engage China on climate change in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian Newspaper from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/220120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has also been part of a series on discussions organised by the [[Mind and Life Institute]]; a non profit organisation that specializes on the relationship between [[science]] and Buddhism. The talks were partly about ecology, ethics and interdependence and issues on global warming were brought up &lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/on-climate-ethics-cow-burps-and-the-dalai-lama/ On Climate, Ethics, Cow Burps and the Dalai Lama] October 21, 2011 NYT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more'']. Ultravisum, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taoism is environmentalism http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-rosenfeld/taoism-is-environmentalis_b_6208594.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology. ({{cite encyclopedia |title=Parasparopagraho Jivanam|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasparopagraho_Jivanam}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">'''Religion and geography''' is the study of the impact of [[geography]], i.e. place and space, on [[religious belief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Routledge Companion to the Study of  Religion|editor=Hinnells, J|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|chapter=Religion and geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the relationship between religion and geography is ''religious geography'', in which geographical ideas are influenced by religion, such as early map-making, and the ''biblical geography'' that developed in the 16th century to identify [[List of Biblical places|places from the Bible]].&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=1990|title=Geography and religion: trends and prospects|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=14|issue=3|pages=355–371|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/14/3/355|doi=10.1177/030913259001400302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research traditions==
Traditionally, the relationship between geography and religion can clearly be seen by the influences of religion in shaping cosmological understandings of the world. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the study of geography and religion mainly focused on mapping the spread of Christianity (termed ecclesiastical geography by Issac 1965), though in the later half of the seventeenth century, the influences and spread of other religions were also taken into account.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Other traditional approaches to the study of the relationship between geography and religion involved the theological explorations of the workings of Nature – a highly environmentally deterministic approach which identified the role of geographical environments in determining the nature and evolution of different religious traditions.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Thus, geographers are less concerned about religion per se, but are more sensitive to how religion as a cultural feature affects social, cultural, political and environmental systems. The point of focus is not the specifics of religious beliefs and practices, but how these religious beliefs and practices are internalised by adherents, and how these processes of internalization influence, and is influenced by, social systems.

==Sacred places==
Traditional cultural geographical approaches to the study of religion mainly seek to determine religion’s impact on the landscape. A more contemporary approach to the study of the intersections of geography and religion not only highlights the role of religion in affecting landscape changes and in assigning sacred meanings to specific places, but also acknowledges how in turn, religious ideology and practice at specific spaces are guided and transformed by their location.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Religious experiences and the belief in religious meanings transforms physical spaces into sacred spaces. These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such sacred spaces. These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies.&lt;ref name="Kong2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2005|title=Religious schools: for spirit, (f)or nation|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=23|pages=615–631|doi=10.1068/d394|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2002|title= In Search of Permanent Homes: Singapore's House Churches and the Politics of Space |journal=Urban Studies|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1573–1586|doi=10.1080/00420980220151664}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of sacred spaces) to present religious meaning and significance.

A key focus in the study of sacred places is the politics of identity, belonging and meaning that are ascribed to sacred sites, and the constant negotiations for power and legitimacy. Particularly in multicultural settings, the contestation for legitimacy, public approval, and negotiations for use of particular spaces are at the heart of determining how communities understand, internalise and struggle to compete for the right to practice their religious traditions in public spaces.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

==Community and identity==
Religion may be a starting point to examine issues of ethnic identity formation and the construction of ethnic identity&lt;ref name="Peach2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peach|first=Ceri|date=2002|title=Social Geography: New Religions and Ethnoburbs – Contrasts with Cultural Geography|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=26|issue=2|pages=252–260|doi=10.1191/0309132502ph368pr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers studying the negotiations of religious identity within various communities are often concerned with the overt articulation of religious identity, for example, how adherents in different locations establish their distinctive (religious and cultural) identities through their own understandings of the religion, and how they externally present their religious adherence (in terms of religious practice, ritual and behaviour). As an overarching theme, the articulation of religious identity is concerned with material aspects of symbolizing religious identity (such as architecture and the establishment of a physical presence), with negotiations and struggles in asserting religious identity in the face of persecution and exclusion and with personal practices of religious ritual and behaviour that re-establishes one’s religious identity&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chivallon|first=Christine|date=2001|title=Religion as Space for the Expression of Caribbean Identity in the United Kingdom |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=19| issue=4|pages=461–483|doi=10.1068/d2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gale|first=Richard|date=2007|title=The Place of Islam in the Geography of Religion: Trends and Intersections|journal=Geography Compass|volume=1| issue=5|pages=1015–1036|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New geographies of religion==
As research on geography and religion has grown, one of the new focuses of geographical research examines the rise of religious fundamentalism, and the resulting impact this has on the geographical contexts in which it develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stump|first=Roger|title=Boundaries of Faith: Geographical Perspectives on Religious Fundamentalism| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, migration processes have resulted in the development of religious pluralism in numerous countries, and the landscape changes that accompany the movement and settlement of communities defined by religion is a key focus in the study of geography and religion.&lt;ref name="Kong2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2010|title=Global shifts, theoretical shifts: Changing geographies of religion |journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=755–776|doi=10.1177/0309132510362602}}&lt;/ref&gt; More work needs to be done to examine the intersections and collisions that occur due to the movement of communities (for example, the migration of Muslim communities to western countries) and highlight how these communities negotiate their religious experiences in new spaces.&lt;ref name="Peach2002" /&gt; Recent research in this area has been published by [[Barry A. Vann]] who analyzes Muslim population shifts in the Western world and the theological factors that play into these demographic trends. &lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Vann (2011), ''Puritan Islam: The Geoexpansion of the Muslim World''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another new area of interest in the study of geography and religion explores different sites of religious practice beyond the ‘officially sacred’ – sites such as religious schools, media spaces, banking and financial practices (for example, [[Islamic banking]]) and home spaces are just some of the different avenues that take into account informal, everyday spaces that intersect with religious practice and meaning.&lt;ref name="Kong2010" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41805">'''Asia''' is the largest and most populous continent, with a wide variety of '''religions''', and was the birthplace of many religions such as &lt;!-- Alphabetical order --&gt;[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. All major religious traditions are practiced in the region and new forms are constantly emerging. Asia is noted for its diversity of culture.

==Dharmic religions==
{{Main article|Indian religions}}
Dharmic religions are the predominant and oldest religions of Asia. Most of Asia's population follows Indian religions. All Indian religions originated in [[South Asia]]. These religions all have the concepts of [[dharma]], [[karma]], and [[reincarnation]].

===Hinduism ===

[[File:Brahmā in "The Land of Temples Or Sketches from Our Indian Empire (1882)" by Mary Hield.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hindu god [[Brahma]]]]
[[Hinduism]] is the second largest and the oldest religion in [[Asia]] with more than 1 billion followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-hindu/ |title=THE GLOBAL RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE: Hindus |accessdate=2012-12-18 |work=pewforum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographically, it is the largest religion in [[Hinduism in India|India]] (80%), [[Hinduism in Nepal|Nepal]] (81%), and the island of [[Balinese Hinduism|Bali]] (83.5%),&lt;ref name=census2010&gt;[http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=0 Penduduk Menurut Wilayah dan Agama yang Dianut] (2010 Census). bps.go.id&lt;/ref&gt; with strong minorities in the Asian nations of [[Hinduism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], [[Hinduism in Fiji|Fiji]], [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Hinduism in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Hinduism in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Oman|Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Russia]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Hinduism in Arab states#Qatar|Qatar]], [[Mayanmar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Afghanistan]]. Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major currents, the primary ones being Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Smartism and Shaktism. The vast majority of present-day Hindus can be categorized under one of these four groups, although there are many other, partly overlapping, allegiances and denominations.

Hinduism predates recorded history and is thought to have had a beginning during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] itself. It has no single founder; rather, it is a diverse melange of traditions, practices, and lineages. [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]] emerged in ancient India from Hinduism.

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Jainism}}
Jainism is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]]. Jains are mostly found in [[India]] but are increasingly found throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Estimates for the population of Jains differ from just over four million to twelve million due to difficulties of Jain identity, with Jains in some areas counted as a Hindu sect. Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. The 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to be at least half the true number. There are an estimated 25,000-30,000 Jains in Europe (mostly in Britain), 20,000 in Africa, 45,000 plus in North America (from {{cite book |title=The Jains |last=Dundas |first=Paul |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=9780415266062 |page=271; 354 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=jains+britain#v=onepage&amp;q=jains%20britain&amp;f=false }}) and 5,000 in the rest of Asia.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to [[ethics|ethical]], [[politics|political]] and economic spheres in India. Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=3724 |title=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2004-09-06 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net |title=Census of India 2001 |publisher=Censusindia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain libraries are the oldest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Jain Knowledge Warehouses: Traditional Libraries in India, John E.

Buddhism was founded by [[Siddartha Gautama]], also known as [[Buddha]].

Before the rise of Islam, Buddhism was one of the most widely practiced religions in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vijaya Samarawickrama |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/buddhismhistory.html |title=The Encyclopedia of Malaysia : Religions and Beliefs |publisher=Encyclopedia.com.my |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618082507/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/buddhismhistory.html |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/indo-txt.htm |title=Mahayana Buddhism: Buddhism in Indonesia |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date=1934-03-10 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion professes its roots in the area of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], whose territories form part of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

This system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharm. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root śhiṣhya meaning "disciple" or "learner", or śhikṣha meaning "instruction".

Sikhism is the 4th largest religion in India with 2% of the total population being Sikh. There is also a large concentration of Sikhs in [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[the Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Hongkong]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]] and [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]].

East Asian religions (also known as [[Far Eastern religions]], [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], or [[Taoic religions]]) form a subset of the [[Eastern religions]].

===Confucianism ===
{{Main article|Confucianism}}
Confucianism was founded in ancient [[China]] by [[Confucius]] (551 B.C.E. - 479). Confucianism is a complex of [[morality|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]], [[politics|political]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], and [[religion|religious]] concerns that permeated the culture and history of [[East Asia]]. Confucianism emphasizes family, social hierarchy, and personal integrity and is manifested in practices and attitudes rather than institutions and is centered on the family and local society. It was, however, considered the [[state religion]] of East Asian countries in some periods. Today the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas have brought Confucianism to all parts of the world.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}
Taoism (also [[romanized]] Daoism) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the [[Tao]] ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized "Dao"]]), a term that means "way", "path" or "principle". The concept is shared with other Chinese philosophies and religions. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes both the source and the driving force inherent in everything that exists. It is ultimately [[Ineffability|ineffable]]: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/tao-te-ching.htm|title=Tao Te Ching, 1. chapter, translated by Livia Kohn (1993)|author=Laozi|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 63"&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed;&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him – the [[Daodejing]] – is dated to the late 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2004, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist propriety and ethics vary according to the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize [[wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Significant Taoist communities can be found in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam and in the [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese diaspora|Vietnamese]] diasporas.

===Chinese folk religion===
{{Main article|Chinese folk religion}}
[[Chinese folk religion]] is a label used to describe the ethnic religious traditions which have been a main belief system in China and among the Han Chinese ethnic group for most of the civilization's history. This group of diverse beliefs comprises [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of various [[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] (神, shén; "deities", "spirits", "awarenesses", "consciousnesses", "archetypes") which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city deities, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the world institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administer local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a component of Chinese religion, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to folk religions or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ChartsBin |url=http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Chartsbin.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
{{Main article|Shintoism}}
[[Kami-no-michi]] is almost unique to [[Japan]] and the [[Japanese diaspora]]. It is a set of practices carried out to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written records of the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] in the 7th and 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified "Shinto religion", but rather to disorganized [[folklore]], [[History of Japan|history]], and [[mythology]]. Shinto today applies to public [[shrine]]s suited to various purposes such as [[Yasukuni|war memorial]]s, [[harvest festival]]s, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations.

[[Shinto]] is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/honcho/index.html |title=Association of Shinto Shrines &amp;#124; 設立 |publisher=Jinja Honcho |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 show that 3% to 3.9% of the population of Japan are members of [[Shinto sects and schools#Shintō inspired religions|Shinto sects and derived religions]].&lt;ref name="NHK2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/summary/research/report/2009_05/090505.pdf |title=2008 NHK survey of religion in Japan — 宗教的なもの にひかれる日本人〜ISSP国際比較調査（宗教）から〜|publisher=NHK Culture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the ''mudang'', usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or [[gods]] and human beings.

Women are enlisted by those who want the help of the [[Spirit|spirit world]]. Shamans hold ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'', or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative or 'bad' [[spirits]] that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms. Today this religion is a minority, but has in recent years seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/world/asia/06iht-shaman.1.6527738.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|Zoroastrianism in India|Zoroastrians in Iran}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] was once the state religion of the [[Persian Empire]], but is now a minority mostly found in [[India]] and [[Iran]]. It worships a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] god, [[Ahura Mazda]], and was founded by [[Zoroaster]]. Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan), probably founded some time before the 6th century BC. The term Zoroastrianism is, in general usage, essentially synonymous with Mazdaism, i.e., the worship of Ahura Mazda, exalted by Zoroaster as the supreme divine authority.

In Zoroastrianism, the Creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil originates from Him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. Mazda is not immanent in the world, and His creation is represented by the Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, of which a significant portion has been lost, and mostly only the liturgies of which have survived. The lost portions are known of only through references and brief quotations in the later works of (primarily) the 9th-11th centuries.

The total number of currently practicing adherents of [[Zoroastrianism]] is unknown. A 2004 estimate gives a range of 124,000 to 190,000,&lt;ref&gt;
According to a survey in 2004 by the Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated at between 124,000 and 190,000. The number is imprecise because of wildly diverging counts in Iran.{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-09-06|accessdate=2009-10-03 | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly half of them in [[India]] (the [[Parsi]] and [[Irani (India)|Irani]] groups).

The largest number of Zoroastrians in Asia can be found in [[India]]; according to the 2001 census, they amounted 69,000.&lt;ref&gt;India's 2001 Census reported 69,601 Parsi Zoroastrians.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], there were some 25,000 according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;25,271 according to http://www.amar.org.ir/Portals/1/Iran/census-2.pdf {{year needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the numbers for Zoroastrians were; India (61,000), Iran (15,000 / 22,271), [[United States]] (14,405), [[Canada]] (6,442), [[Great Britain]] (5,500), [[Australia]] (2,577), [[Arab states of the Arabian Gulf|Persian Gulf Countries]] (1,900) [[Pakistan]] (1,675), [[Singapore]] (372).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fezana.org/downloads/ZoroastrianWorldPopTable_FEZANA_Journal_Fall_2013.pdf Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadis are most [[Persecution of Ahmadiyya|persecuted]] in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[File:Bahá'í House of Worship, Battambang.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bahá'í Temple ([[Battambang]], [[Cambodia]])]]
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith in Asia}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion although it is quite different from [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]. It was so founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in what was then Persia (also known as Iran). Today the largest national population of Bahá'ís is in [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]] with between 1.7 million&lt;ref&gt;Source: Year 2000 Estimated Baha'i statistics from: David Barrett, World Christian Encyclopedia, 2000; Total population statistics, mid-2000 from Population Reference Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; to 3.2 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaindia.org/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India]&lt;/ref&gt; where there is also the [[Lotus Temple]]. Significant populations are found in many countries including [[Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Religion in Malaysia|Malaysia]] where "about 1%", some 260,000, of the population are Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706164701/http://bahai.org.my/main/content/view/42/46/ |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, like [[Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] there are 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web | author = Government of Kazakhstan | title = Religious Groups in Kazakhstan | work = 2001 Census | publisher = Embassy of Kazakhstan to the USA &amp; Canada | year = 2001 | url = http://www.kazakhembus.com/files/Religious_Groups_in_Kazakhstan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day Iran, the religion is severely persecuted (see [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]). In neighboring [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]], Bahá'í Faith is effectively banned,&lt;ref name="turk"&gt;{{cite web | last = compiled by Wagner | first = Ralph D. | title = Turkmenistan | work = Synopsis of References to the Bahá'í Faith, in the US State Department's Reports on Human Rights 1991–2000 | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/documents/hr/hr-turkmenistan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals have had their homes raided for [[Bahá'í literature]].&lt;ref name="raided"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Corley | first = Felix | author-link = Felix Corley | title = TURKMENISTAN: Religious communities theoretically permitted, but attacked in practice? | newspaper = F18News | date = 2004-04-01 | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=293 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information, see [[Bahá'í statistics#Asia|Bahá'í Statistics for Asia]] and [[:Category:Bahá'í Faith by country]].

==Irreligion ==
According to a [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 21.2% of Asia population.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx Religiously Unaffiliated]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population in four Asian countries/territories: [[North Korea]] (71%), [[Japan]] (57%), [[Hong Kong]] (56%), and [[Mainland China]] (52%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"/&gt;

Other sources say that in the [[People's Republic of China]], 59% of the population claim to be [[Irreligion|non-religious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China – People |work=World Desk Reference |url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CN/people.html |accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this percentage may be significantly greater (up to 80%) or smaller (down to 30%) in reality, because some Chinese define religion differently. Some Chinese define religion as practicing customs (which may be done for cultural or traditional reasons), while others define it as actually consciously believing their religion will lead to post-mortem salvation or reincarnation. A Dentsu statistic states that 46% of Vietnamese and 51% of Japanese are irreligious.&lt;ref name="dentsu"&gt;[http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html Dentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre for Japan (2006)]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion in the Faroe Islands''' consists largely of the [[Lutheran]] [[Church of the Faroe Islands]], but also includes smaller Protestant groups such as the [[Open Brethren]], as well as a few [[Roman Catholicism in the Faroe Islands|Catholics]] and adherents of non-[[Trinitarian]] religions, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the established religion since it became independent in 2007; previously the [[Church of Denmark]] held that role.

The [[Faroe Islands]], located between Scotland and Iceland, are partly ruled by [[Denmark]], and as such the people long practiced the same religion as the Danes although religious observance is nowadays more widespread and intense among the Faroese.

==History==

The [[Faroe Islands]] became [[Christianity|Christianized]] between 850 and 1000. Evidence exists for conversions by [[Celtic Christian]] missionaries as early as 850,{{fact|date=August 2017}} but the [[Catholic Church]] was not established on the islands by the latter year. The ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'' is often cited with respect to the early spread of [[Christendom]] in the islands. The saga states that the king of Norway told Sigmund to go by ship to the Faroe Islands with orders from the King. Sigmund's orders were clear: he was supposed to make the 18 small islands Christian, which is what he did, according to the saga. This event is believed to have taken place around 1000, but the Faroese did not establish an organised congregation of the Catholic Church before around 1100, so there do appear to be some inconsistencies in the saga.

Originally belonging to [[Norway]], Faroe fell under the jurisdiction of Denmark in 1523. The last [[Catholic Bishop of the Faroe Islands]] was Ámundur Ólavsson (Amund); he was replaced by the first Lutheran bishop, Jens Gregersøn Riber, in 1540.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 Hindus (0.02%), 66 Buddhist (0.19%), 12 Jews (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 Sikh (0.01%), 149 Others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%) and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church has nearly 150 adherents. There are also small groups of [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] in the country.

'''Religious harmony in India''' is a concept that indicates that there is love, affection in between different religions in India. The Indian constitution supports and encourages religious harmony.&lt;ref name="Constitution of India"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Article 51(A) e|title=Constitution of India|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/867010/|accessdate=27 June 2017|quote=51A.

==Historical Tradition==
The ancient Indian scripture [[Rigveda]] endeavors plurality of religious thought with its mention "''ekaM sadvipraa bahudhaa vadanti ''" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति'')– meaning wise people explain the same truth in different manners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rigveda]] 1.64.46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE), in his 12th edict stated:&lt;ref&gt;Edicts of Ashoka, Trans. Ven. Dhammika,  http://www.livius.org/sh-si/shahbazgarhi/shahbazgarhi2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds. . Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought "Let me glorify my own religion," only harms his own religion. Therefore contact between religions is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Kharavela]] (193 BCE – after 170 BCE) was the third and greatest emperor of the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kaḷinga (present-day Odisha). The main source of information about Khārabeḷa is his famous seventeen line rock-cut Hātigumphā inscription in a cave in the Udayagiri hills near Bhubaneswar, Odisha.The inscription states that the Emperor Kharavela had a liberal religious spirit. Kharavela describes himself as:&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Sadananda (2000): Śrī Khāravela, Sri Digambar Jain Samaj, Cuttack, Orissa&lt;/ref&gt;
“ सव पासंड पूजको सवदेवायतन संकार कारको ” ([[Prakrit language]], [[Devanagari script]])
Translation: The worshiper of all religious orders, the restorer of shrines of all gods.

The [[Grahapati Kokkala inscription]] dated to 1000-1001 CE equates&lt;ref&gt;Khajuraho, Kanhiayalal Agrawal, The McMillan Company of India, 1980, p. 141-146&lt;/ref&gt; 
in Verse 3 equates Shiva with Parama Brahma, Buddha, Vaman and Jina.

===Dharmasthala Temple===
{{Main|Dharmasthala Temple}}
Dharmasthala Temple is a great example of religious harmony in India, as the priests of the temple are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a [[Jain Bunt]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dharmasthala Temple]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts==
The late 19th century and early 20th century Indian [[guru]] and [[yogi]] [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]] preached religious harmony through his teaching. To practise and promote it he combined the celebration of the Hindu festival of [[Rama Navami]] with a Muslim [[Urs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAfRoIQV97MC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=religious+harmony+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Od6-UeqTHsamrQfSj4CoDg&amp;ved=0CEMQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20harmony%20sai%20baba&amp;f=false | title=Islam Means Peace: Understanding the Muslim Principle of Nonviolence Today | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Pal, Amitabh | year=2011 | page=71 | isbn=0313382913 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6pPD-gz7IQC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=religious+harmony+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Od6-UeqTHsamrQfSj4CoDg&amp;ved=0CFcQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20harmony%20sai%20baba&amp;f=false | title=Spiritual Masters: Sai Baba | publisher=Indus Source | author=Desai, Sonavi | year=2003 | page=52 | isbn=8187967641 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lokmanya Tilak]] Organised the programmes like [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and Shivjayanti to preach Religious Harmony among the people.

'''Religious studies''', alternately known as the '''study of religion''', is an academic field devoted to research into [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While [[theology]] attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as [[deities]]),  religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including [[anthropology of religion|anthropology]], [[sociology of religion|sociology]], [[psychology of religion|psychology]], [[philosophy of religion|philosophy]], and [[history of religion]].

Religious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the [[Bible]] had flourished, and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist texts]] were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included [[Friedrich Max Müller]], in England, and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Cornelius P. Tiele]], in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.S. Adcock|title=The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UMfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, it was known as "[[comparative religion]]" or the '''science of religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular [[Mircea Eliade]], from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). 

The religious studies scholar [[Walter Capps]] described the purpose of the discipline as to provide "training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}} At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use "prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible."{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}}
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as "a subject matter" that is "open to many approaches", and thus it "does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status."{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xvii}}

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xvi}} Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=15}}

Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]] world.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=6–7}} It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=7–10}}

==Etymology==
The term "[[religion]]" originated from the Latin noun ''religio'', that was nominalized from one of three verbs: ''relegere'' (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); ''religare'' (to bind oneself [back]); and ''reeligere'' (to choose again).&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P.  ''Catholicism.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these three different potential meanings, an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term "religious" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a "religious").

==Defining "religion"==
[[File:Totem poles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Totem pole]]s reflect the beliefs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]; some religious studies scholars argue that the term "religion" is too Western-centric to encompass the beliefs and practices of communities such as these]]

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term "religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xviii}} Many of these have been ''monothetic'', seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define "religion" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Capps|1y=1995|1p=xviii|2a1=Herling|2y=2016|2p=37}} There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are ''substantive'', seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} The second are ''functional'', seeking to define "religion" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} Other forms of definition are ''polythetic'', producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}}

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various [[secularism|secular]] world views, such as [[nationalism]] and [[Marxism]], which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.{{sfn|Smart|1998|pp=22–26}}

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term "religion" altogether and cease trying to define it.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=36}} In this perspective, "religion" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism.{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}} According to scholar of religion [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], "many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever".{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=10}} There is, for instance, no word for "religion" in languages like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}}

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Before religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s,  several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[William James]]. His 1902 [[Gifford lectures]] and book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''[[The Will to Believe]]'' defends the rationality of faith.

[[Max Weber]] studied religion from an economic perspective in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in [[sociology]], he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
[[Émile Durkheim]] also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Max Muller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Müller]]]]Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[ca.]] 550 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and [[Herodotus]] (ca. 484 BCE &amp;ndash; 425 BCE). Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]]ic scholars such as [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064 CE) studied [[Zoroastrianism|Persian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Indian religions]], among others. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]. [[Peter the Venerable]], also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. [[Max Müller]] was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at [[Oxford University]], a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xv}}

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the [[University of Ibadan]], where [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Parrinder|first=Ursula|last=King|date=4 August 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093222/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', [[Ninian Smart]] wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[United States|America]], "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including [[Hinduism|Indian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]].)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of [[God]], belief and rationality, [[religious cosmology|cosmology]], and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''e.g.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]'s debate concerning original sin), the rise of [[scholasticism]] in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of [[Aristotle]]) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The [[anthropology of religion]] is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===
The [[cultural anthropology]] of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823202612/http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.&lt;ref name=GallupE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx|title=Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912113232/http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/religion-provides-emotional-boost-world-poor.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/religions-correlation-with-poverty/ between religion and poverty].

===Geography of religion===
The geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the "Berkeley school" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. 
Since the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the "politics and poetics" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest{{when|date=September 2018}} in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.

===History of religion===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the [[historicity]] of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M. Schultz and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', 78 (March 2010), 129–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''[[God: A Biography]]'', by [[Jack Miles]].

===Neurological approaches===
The [[temporal lobe]] has been of interest which has been termed the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) [[Neurological]] findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a [[SPECT]]scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Origin of religion===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Revelation}}
The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in [[prehistory]], before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. [[William James]]'s [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of [[religious conversion]], the making of religious decisions, [[religion and happiness]], and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

[[Sigmund Freud]] was another figure in the field of psychology and religion.  He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
{{main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the [[dialectic]]al relationship between religion and [[society]]; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[Concretization|reification]] of religious practise.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|economic foundations of society]]. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like [[France]] or [[Scandinavia]] outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?"&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Paul, "Cross-national correlations of quantifiable societal health with popular religiosity and secularism in the prosperous democracies," ''Journal of Religion &amp; Society'' (2005) 1#1 pp 1-17 [http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123104528/http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf |date=2014-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and religion ===
{{main|Law and religion}}
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new "law and religion" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the ''Journal of Law and Religion'' first published that year and the ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Howard J. | year = 1983 | title = A Survey and Commentary on the New Literature in Law and Religion | journal = Journal of Law and Religion | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 79–169 | jstor=1051074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics on interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elizabeth Mayer | first1 = Ann | year = 1987 | title = Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East | journal = American Journal of Comparative Law | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 127–184 | jstor=840165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pagan Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and film===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like [[Jean Epstein]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=16}}
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=13}} Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=14}}

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are [[hermeneutic]]s, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology ]] is "arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century." (Partridge)  The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of [[German Idealism]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], entitled [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]].  Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by [[Edmund Husserl]], who is considered to be its founder.  In the context of [[Phenomenology of religion]] however, the term was first used by [[Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye]] in his work "Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] influence, "phenomenology" came to "refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts." (Partridge)  Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is [[consciousness]].  He recognized "how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations." (Partridge)  Husserl introduced the term "eidetic vision" to describe the ability to observe without "prior beliefs and interpretations" influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the [[epoche]]: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator.  The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes.  In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.  Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]].  In his ''Religion in Essence and Manifestation'' (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within....The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to "acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self."
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which "all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate 'reality' thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation" (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817094359/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/phenom.htm source]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called "encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encountered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or "eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was "the distinctive method of the discipline".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion [[Thomas Ryba]] noted that this approach to the study of religion had "entered a period of dormancy".{{sfn|Ryba|2006|p=119}}
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with [[Robert A. Segal]] stating that it amounted to "no more than data gathering" alongside "the classification of the data gathered".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}

===Functionalism===
[[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]], in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Connolly|title=Approaches to the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0PUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to [[teleology|teleological]] explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the [[Pentateuch]] as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (''i.e.'' a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
[[Lived religion]] is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion "la religion vécue".&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall|David Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence.  Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which [[Anselm of Canterbury]] gave to it in the 11th century, [[credo ut intelligam]], or faith seeking understanding (literally, "I believe so that I may understand").  The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes.  The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M. Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300-1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, [[Richard E. King]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with [[postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. "Exporting the Local: Recent Perspectives on 'Religion' as a Cultural Category." ''Religion Compass'' 1.6 (2007), pp. 787-800.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly journals==
Much of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Eidson, "Electronic journals in religious studies: Theological libraries prepare for the digital future." ''Journal of Religious &amp; Theological Information'' 3.3-4 (2001): 45-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate L. Ganski, "Accessibility of E-resources from Theological Library Websites."

'''Religious uniformity''' occurs when [[government]] is used to promote one [[state religion]], [[religious denomination|denomination]], or [[philosophy]] to the exclusion of all other religious beliefs.
==History==
Religious uniformity was common in many modern theocratic and atheistic governments around the world until fairly modern times. The modern concept of a separate [[civil government]] was relatively unknown until expounded upon by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a Christian minister, in ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]]'' (1644) shortly after he founded the American colony of [[Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Williams, James Calvin Davis (editor), ''On religious liberty: selections from the works of Roger Williams'', (Harvard University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0-674-02685-3}}, {{ISBN|9780674026858}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=1_iNvIgKzfsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s](accessed July 11, 2009 on Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Emanuel Ernst, Roger Williams, ''New England Firebrand'' (Macmillan Co., Rhode Island, 1932), pg. 246[https://books.google.com/books?id=IsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;dq=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, the [[First Amendment to the Constitution]] (1791) prohibits the federal government from establishing or prohibiting a religion, and in 1947 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot create established state churches in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]''.

==Early life==

Almost everything known about Sai Baba's early life stems from the [[hagiography]] that grew around him, narratives that hold special meaning to his devotees and are considered by them to be evidence of his divine nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanHugh74" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99&gt;Palmer, Norris W.

[[File:Baba-1940's.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sai Baba at the age of 14, soon after proclaiming he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba]]
On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in [[Uravakonda]], a small town near Puttaparthi, 14 year old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; He lost consciousness for several hours&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; There were "symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence."&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/serpent.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part I: 5.

One of the exorcists at [[Kadiri]], a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him;{{elucidate|date=March 2013}} Sathya seemingly kept calm throughout the torture.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"/&gt;

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (''[[prasad]])'' and flowers for them.&lt;ref name="Kheirabadi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masoud Kheirabadi|title=Sri Satya Sai Baba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n06499wG5VcC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=March 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-7910-8104-4|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was [[Spirit possession|bewitched]].

==First mandir and development of Puttaparthi==

In 1944, a [[mandir]] for Sai Baba's devotees was built near the village of [[Puttaparthi]]. It is now referred to as the "old mandir".&lt;ref name="murphetman"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977), ''Man of Miracles'', Weiser, {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen"&gt;Bowen, David (1988).

==Stroke, paralysis and prediction of reincarnation==

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side.&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977). ''Man of Miracles''.

On recovering, Sai Baba announced that he would one day next be reborn as an incarnation named ''Prema Sai Baba'' in the neighbouring state of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt; He stated, "I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the [[gotra]] (lineage) of [[Bharadwaja]], according to a boon won by that sage from [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti|Sakthi]].

On 29 June 1968, Sai Baba made his only overseas trip, to [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kasturi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/iii/awakening.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part III: 3.

==Later years==

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; On 19 January 1981, in [[Chennai]], he inaugurated the Sundaram Mandir.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

In a [[1993 Murders in Prashanthi Nilayam|1993 incident]], four intruders armed with knives entered his bedroom, either as an assassination attempt or as part of a power struggle between his followers. Sai Baba was unharmed. During the scuffle and the police response, the intruders and two of Sai Baba's attendants were killed. The official investigation left questions unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-sri-sathya-sai-baba-101102|title=Who is Sri Sathya Sai Baba?|agency=Press Trust of India|date=24 April 2011|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8471342/Sathya-Sai-Baba.html |title=Religion Obituaries; Satya Sai Baba |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 April 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sathya-sai-baba-escaped-murder-attempt_1535839 |title=Sathya Sai Baba escaped murder attempt|date=25 April 2011|last=Madhusoodan|first=M K |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2 million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the [[Anantapur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name = "cmpraise"/&gt; In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in [[Madurai]], Tamil Nadu.

In 2001 he established another free super-speciality hospital in [[Bangalore]] to benefit the poor.&lt;ref name="TheHinduNewspaper"/&gt; The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2001 reported that Sai Baba told his adherents not to browse the Internet&lt;ref name= VS&gt;The Vancouver Sun, 27 February 2001, ''Holy man? Sex abuser? Both?''&lt;/ref&gt; after Sai Baba said, "These teachings (the Vedas) are highly sacred. Today people are ready to believe all that they see on television and internet but do not repose their faith in the Vedic declarations. Internet is like a waste paper basket. Follow the 'innernet,' not the internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume33/sss33-17.pdf 17. The Source And Centre Of Values]. sssbpt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age and illness==

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped and the boy and stool both fell on him. After that he gave [[darshana]] from a car or his porte chair.&lt;ref name="RadioSai20060407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosai.org/Pages/PB_20060407.htm |title=Sai Global Harmony – Prasanthi Bulletin |publisher=Radiosai.org |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibnlive.in.com82-2"&gt;{{cite web

==Death==

{{Wikinews|Renowned Indian guru Śrī Satya Sai Baba dies aged 84}}
On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the [[Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital]] at Prashantigram at Puttaparthi, following respiration-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sai Baba in stable condition: Hospital| newspaper = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = 5 April 2011| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| accessdate = 24 April 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110509014742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| archivedate = 9 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baba's health condition 'stable' | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 6 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/hyderabad/29388337_1_vital-parameters-condition-crrt | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a month of hospitalisation, during which his condition progressively deteriorated, Sai Baba died on Sunday, 24 April at 7:40 IST, aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba passes away | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 24 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-24/india/29468573_1_sai-baba-sathya-sai-central-trust-puttaparthi   | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. "What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body."&lt;/ref&gt; Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sathya Sai Organisation (or Sri Sathya Sai [[Selfless service|Seva]] Organization) was founded in the 1960s by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srisathyasai.org.in/Pages/Sai_Organisations/Sai_Organisations.htm|title=SSSCT- Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation|work=srisathyasai.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sai Centres were started in India under the name of the "Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi".&lt;ref name="saiindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saibabaofindia.com/sai_baba_centers.htm|title=Sai Baba Of India-Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centers- Sai Baba organisation worldwide|work=saibabaofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sathya Sai Organisation originated "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement."&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"/&gt; The official mission of the Sathya Sai Organization is "to help its members realize the innate divinity within".

The Sathya Sai Organisation publishes an official monthly magazine named ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]'', published by the Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanathana-Sarathi-(magazine) Sanathana Sarathi magazine: Latest News, Videos and Photos of Sanathana Sarathi magazine]. Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of the word Sanathana Sarathi means 'Eternal Charioteer'.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Sai Baba stated that the main objective of the Sathya Sai Organisation "is to help man recognize the divinity that is inherent in him. So, your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give any importance to differences of religion or sect or status or colour. Have the feeling of one-ness permeate every act of yours. Only those who do so have a place in this Organization; the rest can withdraw."&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Baba Sathya Sai Speaks IX, 35, 187–188 (old edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai-se.org/|title=Sathya Sai Baba Avatar Sweden Sverige|work=sathyasai-se.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telugu-Ganga Project'''

The Telugu-Ganga project is a water supply scheme implemented by [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] to provide drinking water to [[Chennai]] city in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The source of water is the river Krishna in Andhra Pradesh and the Poondi reservoir near Chennai is the destination with water planned to be routed through a series of interlinked canals.

The water initially supplied by the canal was disappointing, delivering less than 500 million cubic feet (14×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In 2002, Sri Sathya Sai Baba announced a scheme of restoration and lining of the canal; as his own undertaking. With an extensive rebuilding of the canal and several reservoirs, the project was completed in 2004, when Poondi reservoir received Krishna water for the first time.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The supply of water to Chennai city in 2006 was 3.7 billion cubic feet (100×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; After the re-lining and reconstruction, the Kandaleru-Poondi part of the canal was renamed Sai Ganga.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-4|[4]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-5|[5]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Odisha===
In 2008, two million people in the state of [[Odisha]] were affected by floods. As a relief measure, the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organization built 699 houses as part of their first phase in 16 villages by March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Flood leaves behind a miracle, The Times of India, Chennai, Special Report, 14 April-2010 [http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Search&amp;Key=TOICH/2010/04/14/62/Ar06202.xml&amp;CollName=TOI_CHENNAI_ARCHIVE_2009&amp;DOCID=175302&amp;Keyword=%28%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3Esathya%3Cand%3E%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3Esai%3Cand%3E%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3Ebaba%29&amp;skin=pastissues2&amp;AppName=2&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;GZ=T]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educare===
Sai Baba's ''Educare'' programme seeks to found schools throughout the world with the goal of educating children in the five human values. According to the Sai Educare site, schools have been founded in 33 countries, including Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Sai Educare Website, authorized by the Sathya Sai Organization, [http://www.saieducare.org/html/index.asp Available online]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509220327/http://www.saieducare.org/html/index.asp |date=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educare.sathyasai.org/html/index.asp |title=Sathya Sai Educare |publisher=Educare.sathyasai.org |date= |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times of Zambia states, "The positive influence of Sathya Sai is unprecedented in the annals of education in [[Zambia]].

On 23 November 2001, the digital radio network [[Sai Global Harmony|Radio Sai Global Harmony]] was launched through the World Space Organization, United States. Michael Oleinikof Nobel (distant relative to [[Alfred Nobel]] and one of the patrons for the radio network) said that the radio network would spread Sai Baba's message of global harmony and peace.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu, ''"Saibaba Gospel Goes on Air"'', 24 November 2001, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/11/24/stories/0424201f.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba resided much of the time in his main [[ashram]], ''Prashanthi Nilayam'' (Abode of Highest Peace), at Puttaparthi. In the summer he often left for his other ashram, ''Brindavan'', in Kadugodi, [[Whitefield, India|Whitefield]], a town on the outskirts of [[Bangalore]]. Occasionally he visited his Sai Shruti ashram in [[Kodaikanal]].&lt;ref&gt;The ashrams of Sathya Sai Baba.

===Sathyam, Shivam, Sundaram===
Sai Baba established three primary [[Hindu temple|mandirs]] (spiritual centres) in India. The first mandir, founded in [[Mumbai]] in 1968, is referred to as either the "Dharmakshetra" or "Sathyam". The second centre, established in [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]] in 1973, is referred to as "Shivam". The third, inaugurated on 19 January 1981 in [[Chennai]], is called "Sundaram".&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_04/01MAR06/coverstory_sundaram.htm |title=Sathyam, Shivam and Sundaram Mandirs |work=media.radiosai.org |date=1 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413132444/http://media.radiosai.org/journals/Vol_04/01MAR06/coverstory_sundaram.htm |archivedate=13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed |date=October 2013}}

Many people from various of parts of the world attended the conference which was held at Bharatiya vidya Bhavan campus at versova, Bombay. It consists of various service centers for devotees like a hospital and eye care center. The educational center consists of various training centers.

Followers believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba's ''[[darsana|darshan]]'', scheduled for morning and afternoon each day. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters, materialise and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview for answers to spiritual questions and general guidance.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Criticism ===
Accusations&lt;!-- Please do not change this wording, this has been agreed on the talk page. If you don't agree on it read the discussion there. --&gt; against Sai Baba by his critics over the years have included sleight of hand, sexual abuse, money laundering, fraud in the performance of service projects, and murder.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer116/&gt;

In 1972 [[Abraham Kovoor]] made the first public criticism of Sai Baba&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''Sri Sathya Sai Baba and the Press'', pp. 1–5, 1997 {{ISBN|81-7533-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress" /&gt; that Sai Baba had created a new model of a [[Seiko]] watch, and found the claim to be untrue.&lt;ref name="sathyasaibabasgrace"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''How to Receive Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Grace'', pp. 277, 2006 {{ISBN|81-7182-089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OutlookSingh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spell Breaker|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?262445|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=16 October 2013|author=Rahul Singh|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1976, [[Hosur Narasimhaiah|Hossur Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee "to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions". Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored.&lt;ref name="haraldsson204"&gt;Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt his approach was improper, adding that "Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satya Sai Baba and His Miracles|publisher=The Chakra|url=http://www.chakranews.com/satya-sai-baba-and-his-miracles/3543}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science. What science has been able to unravel is merely a fraction of the cosmic phenomena&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="blitz"&gt;Interview given by Sai Baba to [[R. K. Karanjia]] of ''Blitz'' news magazine in September 1976 [http://www.saibaba.ws/articles/interviewwithjournalistsept1976.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Narasimhaiah's committee was dissolved in August 1977. According to [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], the committee's formal challenge came to a dead end because of its negative attitude and perhaps because of the fanfare surrounding it. Narasimhaiah held the fact that  Sai Baba ignored his letters to be one of several indications that his miracles were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]], who began campaigning against Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sai Baba's purported materialisations of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.&lt;ref name=bbca1&gt;{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for the UK's [[Channel 4]], accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/guru.htm |title=Eagle &amp; Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2010}} [http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/videos/Saimagic.mov Clip]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip from the film was mentioned in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline "DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic".&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–301&lt;/ref&gt; But Haraldsson stated that, on investigating the DD video, researchers did not find evidence of fake materialisation. According to Haraldsson, the video was taken to a company that investigates corporate fraud, which found that it did not provide firm evidence of sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp 300, 295–301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, British journalist Mick Brown stated in his book ''The Spiritual Tourist'' that in his opinion claims of Sai Baba resurrecting American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 were probably untrue.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"&gt;Mick Brown, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', 1998, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|1-58234-034-X}} "In the House of God", pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was based on letters from the attending doctors presented in the magazine ''[[Indian Skeptic]]'', published by Basava Premanand.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, John S. ''My Baba and I'' 1985 published by Birth Day Publishing Company, San Diego, California {{ISBN|0-9600958-8-8}}, "The Resurrection of Walter Cowan", pages&amp;nbsp;28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also related, in the same book, his experiences with manifestations of ''vibuthi'' from Sai Baba's pictures in houses in London, which he felt were not fraudulent or the result of trickery.&lt;ref name="touristmiracle"&gt;Brown Mick, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', "The Miracle in North London", pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30, 1998 {{ISBN|158234034X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown wrote with regards to Sai Baba's claims of omniscience, that "sceptics have produced documentation clearly showing discrepancies between Baba's reading of historical events and biblical prophecies, and the established accounts."&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;

===Claims of sexual abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR), named ''Seduced By Sai Baba'', analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba, and suggested that they could be explained as [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name="seduced"&gt;{{cite video|people=Øyvind Kyrø, Steen Jensen |title=Seduced by Sai Baba |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |date=2002 |time= |url=http://dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204010039/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of the cult, where he alleged sexual abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; As a result, in 2002 the Parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the possible danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2001-02/886] UK Parliament official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[BBC]] produced a documentary titled ''The Secret Swami'', as part of its series "The World Uncovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; This World &amp;#124; Secret Swami |publisher=BBC News |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd&gt;{{cite video|people=Eamon Hardy, Tanya Datta|title=Secret Swami|medium=Documentary|publisher=BBC News|date=2004 |time= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd/&gt; The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand. Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. Here, he claimed that Sai Baba was "not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser". According to his interview, he had stories which spanned 30 years, and he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba "put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil". Premanand theorised that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they were too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Responses===
Sai Baba and his followers reject any allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Devotee [[Bill Aitken (traveller)|Bill Aitken]] was quoted by ''[[The Week]]'' as saying that Sai Baba's reputation had not been harmed by the negative stories published about him. He said that the more detractors railed against Sai Baba, the more new devotees went to see him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |title=Miracle of Welfare |accessdate=9 September 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |archivedate=9 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been levelled at Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.&lt;ref name="divine"&gt;Brown, Mick (28 October 2000). "Divine Downfall". Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition'', Lawrence A. Babb wrote of Sai Baba, "Whoever he is, he is certainly more than the mere parlour magician many of his critics claim that he is."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicise their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Times of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 quoted Sai Baba as saying: {{quote|[[Jesus Christ]] underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/sai-baba-lashes-out-at-detractors/articleshow/534425761.cms&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an official letter made public in December 2001, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]] and a devotee of Sai Baba),&lt;ref name=Palmer97-98 /&gt; [[P. N. Bhagwati|P.N. Bhagwati]] (Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), [[Ranganath Misra]] (Chair Person, National Human Rights Commissioner of India and Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), [[Najma Heptulla]] (President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union; UNDP Distinguished Human Development Ambassador) and [[Shivraj V. Patil|Shivraj Patil]] (Member of Parliament, India; Formerly of the Lok Sabha &amp; Union Minister) all signed the following statement:

{{quote|We are deeply pained and anguished by the wild, reckless and concocted allegations made by certain vested interests and people against Bhagwan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

The relationship between '''Scientology and other religions''' is very complex. While [[Scientology]] claims that it is fully compatible with all existing major world religions and that it does not conflict with them or their religious practices, there are major differences in beliefs and practices between Scientology and most religions, especially the major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions. Members are not allowed to engage in other similar mental therapies or procedures, religious or otherwise.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce"&gt;Steve Bruce: ''Cathedrals to cults: the evolving forms of the religious life''. In: Paul Heelas (Hrsg.): ''Religion, Modernity, and Postmodernity'', Blackwell, Oxford 1998, pp. 19-35, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some ministers from other churches have adopted some Scientology secular programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/02/18/Worldandnation/Scientology_awards_re.shtml Scientology awards reach out to black community] ROBERT FARLEY, St. Petersburg Times, February 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Matt |last= Sedensky |title= Unlikely allies |url= http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ |work= [[Associated Press|AP]] |publisher= [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date= 2007-08-25 |accessdate= 2007-08-30 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901004306/http://knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacob Neusner]], Scientology is a "synthesis of existing ideas and a reflection of particular cultural, social, and historical circumstances in which it was born and developed". The religion reflects Western and American values, such as "beliefs in democracy, individualism, and freedom", while borrowing little from religions based on the Bible. Similarities exist between Scientology and eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The Church of Scientology has capitalized on the religion's similarity to Buddhism to win followers in historically Buddhist-influenced countries like [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="taibud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/scientology-in-taiwan/493493/|title=The Curious Rise of Scientology in Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Frank K. Flinn called Scientology technological Buddhism, however, it can be differentiated from Buddhist asceticism as its aim is not the eradication of pain through the removal of desire or detaching oneself from the world. Furthermore, it has nothing in common with Buddhist prayer offerings; it is not contemplative, but action-oriented and practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Affinities between Scientology and Theosophy |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church of England==
The [[Church of England]] complained in March 2003 to the Advertising Standards Authority about the Church's advertising poster promoting Narconon—the drug rehabilitation program based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. The poster claimed "250,000 people salvaged from drugs." The Church of England Diocese of Birmingham challenged the claim. Upholding the complaint, the ASA considered that, "without clarification, readers were likely to interpret the claim '250,000 people salvaged from drugs' to mean that 250,000 people had stopped being dependent on street or prescription drugs because of Scientology. The Authority "accepted that more than 250,000 people had undertaken the Church's Drug Purification and Drug Rundown programs, which were designed to free people from the effects of taking drugs," but "the Authority understood that, within Scientology, the concept of 'drug use' referred to a variety of behaviors that ranged from heavy use of street drugs to occasional ingestion of alcohol or prescription medicines and exposure to chemical toxins."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 Advertising Standards Authority record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041255/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 |date=2007-09-28 }} of successful Church of England complaint about Narconon advertisement&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Diocese of Birmingham|Diocese of Birmingham]] objected to Scientology using space in the community centre allotted for religious use. The Diocese pointed out that Scientology does not have religious status in the UK: "Scientology has rightly been refused recognition as a religion by the UK Charity Commissioners" in the words of a Diocese spokesman.&lt;ref name="Diocese"&gt;{{cite web |first= James |last= Cartledge |title= Church anger at 'cult' space |url= http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/tm_method=full%26objectid=14177182%26siteid=50002-name_page.html |work= [[Birmingham Mail|Evening Mail]] |publisher= |date= 2004-04-24 |accessdate= 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diocese also stated that Scientology is "as much a religion as a dog is a vegetable."&lt;ref name="Diocese"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
[[Maximos (Aghiorgoussis)|Maximos Aghiorgoussis]], the [[bishop]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] in Pittsburgh, has stated that Scientology is not in fact a "church", but rather a [[gnosticism|gnostic]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] system of thought. He went on to say that there are at least six serious points of contention between the two groups, including:
*the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] nature of Scientology,
*Scientology's contention that the individual is a noncorporeal, semi-divine "[[thetan]]," which runs contrary to the Greek Orthodox view that the individual is both body and soul and, while created in the image of God, not a god himself,
*Scientology's belief that the universe is the "result of a game of the thetans", rather than the account of the [[Genesis creation narrative]],
*Scientology's belief that the thetan can be saved through the clearing of its [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], which differs from the [[salvation (Christianity)|Christian view of salvation]] being only through Christ, and
*Scientology's view that death is "of no consequence and significance because death is repeated innumerable times", which runs contrary to the Christian view of a single physical incarnation.

He also states that "Scientology teaches that psychic powers, (evil) spirits, and out-of-body events can be used in order for the thetans to rediscover their true powers. Because of this, there have been parallels drawn between Scientology and [[occultism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. He goes on to say that, in spite of Scientology's claims to enhance mental health, that many people have already been damaged by Dianetics. Calling upon what he describes as "unclean spirits", the inexperience of those who do [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] cause "hallucination, irrational behavior, severe disorientation, strange bodily sensations, physical and mental illness, unconsciousness, and suicide. Hubbard admitted most of the above hazards, 'although he maintained that they occurred only through misapplication of the technology of Scientology'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=67293442&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientld=39419&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD "The challenge of metaphysical experiences outside Orthodoxy and the Orthodox response"] at ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2001, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] criticized Scientologists, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unificationism|Unificationists]], and [[Mormonism|Mormons]] as being dangerous "totalitarian sects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 "Russian Orthodox Targets 'Totalitarian Sects'"] at [[Zenit News Agency]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060708213901/http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 Archive copy] at the [[Internet Archive Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran Church==
The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in Germany has criticized Scientology's activities and doctrines, along with those of several other religious movements. According to the U.S. State Department's 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, "The Lutheran Church also characterizes [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the Jehovah's Witnesses, the [[Church of Christ]], [[Christian Scientists]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and the [[Johannische Church]] as 'sects,' but in less negative terms than it does Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41683.htm "2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Germany"] at [[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has not made official doctrinal pronouncements specifically related to Scientology, however Cardinal Marc Ouellet stated "Scientology is something else. For me, this community is not a Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bussières |first= Ian |title= Scientologie: "Ce n'est pas une Église" - Mgr Ouellet |work= [[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]] |publisher= [[Power Corporation of Canada]] |date= February 5, 2009 |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/200902/04/01-824289-scientologie-ce-nest-pas-une-eglise-mgr-ouellet.php |accessdate= 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain beliefs that are widely associated with Scientology, such as [[reincarnation]], are specifically rejected by the Catholic Church as being incompatible with Catholic belief and practice. Scientology is also, according to a number of religious scholars, a form of [[gnosticism]], which would make it hard to reconcile with Roman Catholicism and other denominations that regard gnosticism as a [[Christian heresy|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tirdad |last=Derakhshani |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/special_packages/sunday_review/12042623.htm |title=Spirituality through therapy |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2006-07-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New religious movement scholar Douglas E. Cowan compares the basic auditing session in Scientology to the Roman Catholic confessional. He writes, “the auditing session is about confession – the discovery, revelation, and absolution of critical life experiences.” He differentiates the two, however, the confession is mediated by the physicality of the screen and auditing is mediated by the e-meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Cowan |first=Douglas E. |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Clearly Material: Objects, Meaning, and the Ongoing Construction of New Religious Reality |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nation of Islam==
Scientology’s relationship with the [[Nation of Islam]] is related to its inclusivity of other denominations, according to scholar Donald A. Westbrook. This relationship developed since 2009, with 4000 members of the NOI receiving introductory training as auditors with the endorsement of NOI Leader Louis Farrakhan.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Nation of Islam (NOI) announced in an official newspaper that an estimated 700 NOI members have become certified Hubbard Dianetics Auditors, with more NOI members soon to be trained in Scientology techniques.&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"&gt;reference: https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/06/07/black-supremacist-nation-islam-pushes-white-dominated-scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan is known to encourage his congregation to read Dianetics and receive training for auditing. Eliza Gray comments on a comparison and contrast of the two religions, asserting that “at the core of both religions is a never-ending pursuit of a better self. In the case of Scientology, that best self is ‘clear’ of residual traumas buried in the subconscious. In the Nation [of Islam], that self is free of hang-ups of white culture that black people have internalized to their detriment.” Farrakhan has taught his followers to seek truth wherever it is contained, despite the inherent contradiction of following Hubbard’s teaching while he poses resistance to the “whites.” He declares to his followers that L. Ron Hubbard has made “white people better than they are,” describing Hubbard’s Dianetics as a way for “whites to expunge themselves from ‘devilish’ qualities.”&lt;ref&gt;reference: https://newrepublic.com/article/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan supports Hubbard’s spiritual technology, including auditing, which he claims is a “vital tool” for the awakening of his people. Leah Nelson writes that Farrakhan “has been telling his followers to embrace Scientology in order to move closer to perfection in preparation for the end times.”&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"/&gt; Farrakhan has commented on the complementary and supplementary role that Scientology has on NOI. He does not necessarily view Dianetics training as conversion into Scientology, rather, he views Hubbard’s technologies as tools for “black empowerment and betterment which contribute to his particular theological vision for Muslims in America,” as Donald A. Westbrook writes.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

Speculating on the curious embracement by Farrakhan of Scientology doctrine, Chip Berlet of the Southern Poverty Law Center, hypothesizes: “The possibility exists that Farrakhan sees his followers as not ‘clear’ enough to make contact with the ‘Mothership.&lt;ref&gt;reference: "Clearing the Planet: The Adoption of the Teachings of L. Ron Hubbard by Louis Farrakhan, and its Significance for the Eschatology of the Nation of Islam” by Jacob Michael King, Claremont Graduate University, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Williams asserts that just like NOI, Scientology is a “very rationalized or modern religion.” Jacob Michael King states that both religions are “engaged in reframing traditional spiritual ideas, and both employ scientific language in an attempt to “modernize” elements seen as outdated.” Dianetic Auditing runs parallel with NOI’s determination of the knowledge of self. “While self-knowledge in the NOI offers the believer an identity as part of a collective, auditing through ‘locating areas of spiritual distress… and improving their condition’ purports to free the individual to determine herself and to better author her own destiny,” states Jacob King.&lt;ref&gt;reference: Willms, Gerald. “Scientology: ‘Modern Religion’ or ‘Religion of Modernity’?” In Scientology, ed. James R. Lewis (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), Nook Edition, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Chicago, Inglewood, Hollywood and Clearwater are the loci of NOI Dianetics training. The Church of Scientology Community Center in Inglewood also functions as a Sunday meeting place for NOI members. Scientologists have also worked with NOI-lead initiatives to reduce crime rites in the Los Angeles inner cites, using the Scientology-sponosored program [[The Way to Happiness]].&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

==Hubbard's definition of religion==
In 1970, Hubbard offered an old-fashioned view of religion that included some broad ideas: “In a few words, religion can be defined as belief in spiritual beings. More broadly, religion can be defined as a system of beliefs and practices by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of human life. The quality of being religious implies two things: first, a belief that evil, pain, bewilderment and injustice are fundamental facts of existence; second, a set of practices and related sanctified beliefs that express a conviction that man can ultimately be saved from those facts.”&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L. Ron Hubbard |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |year=2016 |last=Frenschkowski |first=Marco|doi=10.5840/asrr20166620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
Scientology's claim of religious compatibility to entry-level Scientologists is soon modified by the additional teaching that the various levels of spiritual process which can be reached through Scientology are more advanced than those attainable in other religions. The major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions and Scientology share the claim of [[Universality (philosophy)|Universality]] of their belief system which precludes compatibility in the view of most scholars.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce" /&gt; Critics point out that, within Scientology, "spiritual abilities" tends to be synonymous with "mystical powers" rather than with "inner peace." Hubbard himself cautioned against the unwise or improper use of powers in his book ''History of Man''.

In its application for tax-exempt status in the United States, the Church of Scientology International states:

{{cquote|Although there is no policy or Scriptural mandate expressly requiring Scientologists to renounce other religious beliefs or membership in other churches, as a practical matter Scientologists are expected to and do become fully devoted to Scientology to the exclusion of other faiths. As Scientologists, they are required to look only to Scientology Scriptures for the answers to the fundamental questions of their existence and to seek enlightenment only from Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Response to Final Series of IRS Questions Prior to Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) As a Church, October 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard discussed Buddhism in an early 1952 lecture in London, speaking about Buddhist reincarnation stories, about the Christian God and other religious topics. While theologian Marco Frenschkowski claims that Hubbard may have been experimenting with ways Scientology is similar to Buddhism, some scholars such as [[Frank A. Flinn]] and Stephen A. Kent interpret the Scientology founder's "reverence for Buddhism as a rather awkward response to external pressure." Hubbard clarified that Scientology is not a neo-Buddhist group.&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; Scientology and Buddhism differ in that in Scientology there is no concept of Nirvana. According to religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin, in Buddhism, adherents aim to the suppression of the mind which is in direct opposition to the Scinetologist idea of "transparency to himself".&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Terrin |first=Aldo Natale |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Scientology and Its Contiguity with Gnostic Religion and Eastern Religions |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard sometimes identified himself with [[Maitreya]] (Metteya in [[Pali]]), a [[prophecy|prophesied]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of the future. This identification is made most strongly in his 1955–1956 poem ''[[Hymn of Asia]]'',&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; which begins with the line "Am I Metteyya?" and emphasizes certain traits of Hubbard that the editors of the publication said matched traits predicted by the "Metteya Legend," such as Metteya appearing in the West, having golden hair or red hair (Hubbard was red-haired), and appearing in a time of world peril, with the earliest of the predicted dates for his return being 2,500 years after [[Gautama Buddha]], or roughly 1950. According to the sociologist [[Stephen A. Kent]], however, the traits which the editors say are predicted by the "Metteya Legend" either are not actually present in the Buddhist texts or in some cases are contradicted by the texts: instead of coming at a time of world peril, for instance, the predictions about Maitreya say he will be born to royalty whose domain is "mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded and well fed," and rather than having hair "like flames," Kent says that the texts predict curly black hair for the Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kent |first=Stephen A. |authorlink=Stephen A. Kent |year=1996 |title=Scientology's Relationship With Eastern Religious Traditions |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=21 |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology's%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |accessdate=2007-03-31 |doi=10.1080/13537909608580753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revealed beliefs in Scientology at higher levels become increasingly contradictory with the world's major religions. The concept of past lives in Scientology is at odds with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Beliefs concerning the origins and age of the Earth, the root of evil, and the nature of man make it impossible to uphold the beliefs of most other religions while also being a Scientologist. Hubbard claimed that Islam was the result of an extraterrestrial memory implant, called the Emanator, of which the [[Kaaba]] is supposedly an artifact. Mainstream religions, in his view, had failed to realize their objectives: "It is all very well to idealize poverty and associate wisdom with begging bowls, or virtue with low estate. However, those who have done this (Buddhists, Christians, Communists, and other fanatics) have dead ended or are dead ending."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, HCO PL of January 21, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the [[Fishman Affidavit]] pertaining to Operating Thetan level VIII put forward that Hubbard said that [[Jesus]] was a [[pederast]]. The Church of Scientology has consistently held this section of the Fishman Affidavit to be a [[forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karin Spaink]]. The Fishman Affidavit: introduction. Retrieved 2008-02-29. [http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/fishman/index2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Richard Holloway writes that the underlying principle in Scientology is the ancient Hindu doctrine of reincarnation or samsara, but without nirvana. Scientologists believe in the immortality of souls that travel from one body to another in a span of a trillion years, without final salvation or damnation. “There is only the eternal return of life after life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin describes the similarity of Scientology and Gnostic thought, comparing the convergent concepts of the “Thetan” (spiritual) of Scientology and the “Demiurge” or half-god of Gnostic religion. Both the thetan and demiurge struggle against the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]], there are stages of ascent (as in the [[Operating Thetan]] stages) just as the equivalent “ascent” of the demiurge or soul. Terrin also mentions the parallelism of Gnostic thought, Buddhism and Scientology, where the idea of “mindfulness” in Buddhism is similar to the Gnostic thought of “awareness.” Scientology’s version of mindfulness is the “transparency of the spirit.” Frank Flinn stresses that the similarities between Buddhism and Scientology include the following: (1) “Knowing for oneself,” or “personal experience” as criterion of truth; (2) “The scientific understanding of cause and effect” in matters of the Spirit (karma); (3) Buddhism’s “pragmatic” approach without any other metaphysic vision; and (4) the emphasis on individual action. Hubbard’s clearest mention of his Gnostic worldview is in The Factors, a brief document and Hubbard’s 1953 lecture on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 |accessdate=2018-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard has made direct references to the comparison between Scientology and eastern religions: “But are we indebted to Asia?… All of us have the same potentials, but it happens that the information which has been collected over the years is available in Asia. It has been not preserved in the Western world. Therefore, we look to such things as the [[Vedas|Veda]].” Hubbard says in the Phoenix Lectures: “And what we have just talked about in terms of knowing the way to Knowingness, is very, very closely associated here with Buddha, or Lord Buddha, or Gautama Buddha, or the Blessed One, or the Enlightened one.”

In a study that compares Scientology with Eastern religions, scholar [[Roy Wallis]] wrote that there are a lot of parallelisms between Hindu yoga and Scientology. In Hindu yoga, the yoga system would lead to a knowledge where the rebirth bring about a “non conditioned mode of being” and the aim of Samkhya-yoga would consist in the dissociation of purusha (immortal spirit) from prakrti (matter). Now, the same would be the aim of Scientology in seeking to dissociate the Thetan – equivalent to purusha (immortal, free, divine) – in the attempt to liberate the self from the MEST (matter, prakrti).

L. Ron Hubbard taught that Scientology is the science of “knowing how to know,” corresponding to the perpetually “curious” disposition of the true Scientologist, without claiming access to revelation. This is similar to the idea of “how to invent the new reality and freedom,” in Gnostic thought, where knowledge is accompanied by imagination.&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"/&gt;

Hubbard had a basic skepticism about religious claims, even about the existence of God. On July 1950, upon addressing a child’s queries about the existence of angels, he clearly showed that he was talking about something that didn’t exist. On March 1954, he talked about mysticism, spiritualism, and  “guardian angels and priests and all this sort of thing as the requirement  to inquire from nothingness for direction.” When referring to God he mentions “taking orders from an indefinite nothingness.” Dianetics does not mention God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frenschkowski |first1=Marco |title=Brill Handbook of Scientology |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |work=Brill Hanbbooks on Contemporary Religion |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |year=2016 |isbn=9789004328716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Mikael Rothstein, just as Jesus is the sole object of religious devotion and source of salvation, and the church is seen as an "extension" of Jesus' divinity, "the entire fabric of Scientology is best understood as an expansion of the individual, L. Ron Hubbard, including the buildings currently emerge as physical manifestations of Scientological ideals and virtues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is an act of transgression against [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and [[God]]; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human [[Life|living]]. In [[Jainism]], sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (being) to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (supreme emancipation). In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]). [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sons'', ''sont-is''' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=9Bb3P3&amp; |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Biblical terms translated as "sin" or "syn" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of [[New Testament Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁμαρτία}} ''hamartia'' "sin", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(marti/a|ἁμαρτία}}, {{LSJ|a(marta/nw|ἁμαρτάνω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish views on sin|Hebrew ''hata'' "sin"]] originates in [[archery]] and literally refers to missing the "gold" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "To sin" has been defined from a Greek [[Bible concordance|concordance]] as "to miss the mark".&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/hamartia.html "Hamartia,"] ''The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] eventually (after the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian controversy]]) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine ''On Grace and Free Will'' in ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P. Holmes, vol. 5, 30-31 [14-15]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Anchor| Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}

[[Buddhism]] believes in the principle of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', whereby [[Dukkha|suffering]] is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three poisons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Poisons": "Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of [[Buddhist ethics]] is [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.
Karma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. 
One needs to purify negative karma [[Satipatthana Sutta|Four Satipatthanas]] to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches [[Nirvana]], the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]
{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Seven deadly sins}}
In the [[Old Testament]], some sins were [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|punishable by death]] in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. [[Christians]] consider the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] to be fulfilled by the [[The gospel|Gospel]].

In the [[New Testament]] the [[Atonement in Christianity|forgiveness of sin]] is effected through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] and [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] ([[Mark 1]]:15).&lt;ref&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/ref&gt; Sin is [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiven]] when the sinner acknowledges, [[Confession (religion)#Christianity|confesses]], and repents for their sin as a part of believing in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Michael|title=Dogma: The Church as Sacrament|date=1975|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3203-8|page=220,222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5oTziWXEKgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinner is expected to confess his sins to [[God in Christianity|God]] as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes [[Gratitude#Christian conceptions|giving thanks]] to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a [[Union with Christ|union with God]] which abides forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willmington|first1=H.L.|title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible|date=1981|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-8423-8804-4|page=725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] [[Romans 6:23|6:23]], it is mentioned that "the wages of sin is death", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romans 6:23|url=https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm|website=Biblehub|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Christianity]], sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme [[Agape|love for mankind]]. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] as a [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfactory sacrifice]] for the sins of humanity. Humanity was [[Destiny#Religion|destined]] for life with God when [[Adam]] disobeyed God. The Bible in [[John 3:16]] says "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

In [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as [[Fall of man|the refusal]] to follow [[Will of God|God's plan]] and the desire to be "like God" (as stated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in Genesis).

{{Anchor|Original sin}}
[[Original sin]] is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through [[Adam and Eve]]'s sin in the [[Garden of Eden]] and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=Original Sin|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|The serpent]] who beguiled [[Eve]] to eat of [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and [[Genealogies of Genesis|Eve's descendants]] (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being [[Fall of man#Subordination|subordinate to Adam]] originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper ([[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis 2:18-25]]); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her [[Christian views on marriage|husband]] and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain [[Religion and agriculture|to be planted, nurtured, and harvested]]. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when [[Christian burial|buried]] after death. When Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain slew his brother Abel]], he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first [[Curse and mark of Cain|marked him]] with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).

One concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the [[Temporality|temporal]]) body, is not of ([[eternity|eternal]]) transcendental living and therefore its ''excessive'' [[Gluttony|savoring]] is considered a sin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Hanegraaff, Hank. ''The Bible Answer Book'' pp. 18-21. {{ISBN|0-8499-9544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforgivable sin (or [[eternal sin]]) is a sin that can never be forgiven;
Matthew 12:30-32 :
" &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and [[Blasphemy#Christianity|blasphemy]] shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And whosoever shall speak a word against the [[Son of man]], it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the [[Holy Ghost]], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called [[mortal sin]]s and less serious sins called [[venial sin]]. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1472|location=The Vatican|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1472.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.

The [[Lamb of God]] was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest [[Aaron]] was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a [[sacrificial lamb|spotless young lamb]].

=== Hinduism ===
&lt;!--Section was previously blanked by an IP: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sin&amp;diff=391608941&amp;oldid=391538998 --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], the term ''sin'' (''{{IAST|pāpa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]]) is often used to describe actions that create negative [[Karma]] by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat  similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) [[Dharma]], or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term ''aparadha'' is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and  Purva-Mimansa . The term  ''papa'' however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a  lack of consensus  regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that ''papa'' has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}

In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (''paap''), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (''punya'') meaning merit. A ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (a being) acquires sin based on its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.

No ''jiva'' can achieve ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A ''jiva'' accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A ''jiva'' ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of ''samyak gyan'' (right knowledge), ''samyak darshan'' (right sight) and ''samyak charitra'' (right character). A ''jiva'' begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.

If a ''jiva'' does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a ''jiva'' is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant [[reincarnation]], wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are ''dev'' (beings of heaven, including deities), ''manushya'' (human), ''tiryanch'' (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and ''naarki'' (beings of hell). 

During this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the ''jiva'' will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the ''jiva'' will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.

It is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the "sinful karma" but even the "meritorious karma" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the ''jiva'' to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain ''moksha'', because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.

Jains believe that only a human ''jiva'' has the capacity and the will to attain ''moksha''. Hence the ''jiva'' should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to ''moksha''. In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely [[vegetarian]] but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish views on sin|Golden mean (philosophy)#Judaism}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Mosaic law]] for [[Jews]], or the seven [[Noahide laws]] for [[Gentiles]] as a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Seven_Noahide_Laws.html|title= The Seven Noachide Laws - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rosenberg|first1= A. J.|last2= [[Rashi]]|title= The Book of Genesis (Genesis 8:21 with [[Rashi]]'s commentary)|date= 1969|publisher= The Judaica Press|location= New York|isbn= 1880582082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the [[613 commandments|mitzvot]] (without negligence) do not count as sins. "Sins by error" are considered as less severe sins. When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot|sacrifices]] for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''[[korbanot]]'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate such "sins by error", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|title= Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot)|publisher= Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title= Leviticus 17:11|author= Rabbi Michael Skobac|publisher= Jews for Judaism|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">'''Singleness of [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]''' (also called '''singleheartedness''') is the ideal of having sole devotion to a task or endeavour.  It is normally employed in a religious or spiritual context.  In antiquity it was thought of as a counteraction to the divisive effects of civilization on the soul.  It is especially associated with the practices of [[Christian monasticism]].

Referring to the desert landscape inhabited by the earliest Christian monks, [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], in ''A History of Private Life'', explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bleak, asocial landscape of the desert was a distant image of Paradise -- the first, the true home of humankind, where Adam and Eve had dwelt in full majesty, before the subtle and overpowering onset of the doublehearted cares of human life in settled society, before marriage, physical greed, the labor of the earth, and the grinding cares of present human society robbed them of their original serenity.  Totally singlehearted, therefore joined with the angelic hosts in unfailing and undivided praise of God, the life of the monk mirrored on earth the life of the angels.  &lt;small&gt;(''Paul Veyne, editor. Harvard: 1987. Volume I, p. 289'')&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Søren Kierkegaard expressed a similar concept in his maxim "Purity of heart is to will one thing" and his sermon-form essay bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topics/purity-heart-will-one-thing&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sparagmos''''' ({{lang-grc|σπαραγμός}}, from σπαράσσω ''sparasso'', "tear, rend, pull to pieces") is an act of rending, tearing apart, or mangling,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lincoln]], ''Death, War, and Sacrifice: Studies in Ideology and Practice'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; usually in a [[Dionysian]] context.

In Dionysian rite as represented in myth and literature, a living animal, or sometimes even a human being, is [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed]] by being dismembered. ''Sparagmos'' was frequently followed by [[omophagia]] (the eating of the raw flesh of the one dismembered). It is associated with the [[Maenad]]s or Bacchantes, followers of [[Dionysus]], and the [[Dionysian Mysteries]]. Historically, however, there is little indication that women celebrating the rites of Dionysus dismembered animals or ate raw flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Dillon, ''Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion'' (Routledge, 2002), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of ''sparagmos'' appear in [[Euripides]]'s play ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In one scene guards sent to control the Maenads witness them pulling a live bull to pieces with their hands. Later, after King [[Pentheus]] has banned the worship of Dionysus, the god lures him into a forest, to be torn limb from limb by Maenads, including his own mother [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]]. According to some myths, [[Orpheus]], regarded as a prophet of Orphic or Bacchic religion, died when he was dismembered by raging Thracian women. 

==Medea==
[[Medea]] is said to have killed and dismembered [[Absyrtus|her brother]] whilst fleeing with [[Jason]] and the stolen [[Golden Fleece|fleece]] in order to delay their pursuers, who would be compelled to collect the remains of the prince for burial. The Italian film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] staged a sparagmos ritual as part of a long sequence near the beginning of his film ''[[Medea (1969 film)|Medea]]'' (1969), before dramatising the episode in which Medea kills her brother in a similar way.

==Modern literature and theory==
Interpreting the ritual through the lens of the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Oedipus complex]], Catherine Maxwell identifies ''sparagmos'' as a form of [[castration]], particularly in the case of Orpheus.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Maxwell, ''The Female Sublime from Milton to Swinburne: Bearing Blindness'', Manchester University Press, 2001, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary literature, this is used in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s play ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. 

Sparagmos is also briefly mentioned in [[Donna Tartt|Donna Tartt's]] ''[[The Secret History]]''.

Sparagmos is a central theme in [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s [[The First Death]] recounting the torments of a mutilated protagonist stranded on an island. The book draws upon the dismemberment of Dionysus as well as ancient Greek rituals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Modern Greek Studies,Volume 19, 2001/ Johns Hopkins University Press.

{{Expand French|Commission_Stasi|date=January 2012}}
The French '''commission Stasi''' is a commission set up to reflect upon the application of the ''[[laïcité]]'' principle. Named after the chair [[Bernard Stasi]], [[ombudsman]] of the (French) Republic (''médiateur de la République'') since 1998, and consisting of 20 members, it was set up by the [[President of France|president of the Republic]] [[Jacques Chirac]] on 3 July 2003. It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.

==Overview==

Jacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission.&lt;ref&gt;France 5, ''Dossiers - Débat Public :'' [http://www.france5.fr/actu_societe/W00137/9/102197.cfm La laïcité (La Commission Stasi)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as [[Cardinal Lustiger]], intellectuals such as [[Régis Debray]] and [[Patrick Weil]] as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1275-t2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;



The commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the [[hijab]] in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.

In response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.

==Principles==

The report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and [[freedom of thought]] particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.

The Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or [[reasonable accommodation]] into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].

{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}
Though it is no longer practiced today, [[Tonga]]'s ancient religion was practiced for over 2000 years. [[Christian missionary|Missionaries]] arrived and persuaded [[King George Tupou I]] to convert to [[Christianity]]; he ordered and strictly enforced that all Tongans become Christian and no longer practice the ancient [[polytheistic religion]] with its supreme god [[Tangaloa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Bernice P. Bishop Museum|journal=Bulletin|volume=61|year=1929|title=Tongan society|last=Gifford|first=E. W.|url=http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pubs-online/bpbm-bulletins.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pulotu==
[[Pulotu]] was the unseen world, the domain of the god or goddess [[Hikule'o]] believed to be reached by sea. Stories told of journeys to Pulotu. Tongans identify Pulotu with the underworld, ''Lolofonua''. Pulotu is also identified with the cemetery or graveyard. Long ago, it was believed that Pulotu could be visited by a man to recover a dead wife. Hikule'o would assemble the spirits so the wife could be found, reanimated and released.

Two entrances are pointed out by Tongans. One is ''Ahole'' a deep hole on the island of Koloa, [[Vava'u]]. Ahole was the opening from which ''Maui Kisikisi'' brought fire from the underworld to this world. The second opening was through the island of [[Tofua]]. There are three divisions of Pulotu called ''Pulotu Tete'', ''Pulotu 'Aka'aka'', and ''Pulotu Tu'uma'u''.

==Gods and deities==
===Tangaloa===
[[Tangaloa]], the sky god, was regarded in Vava'u as the deity who hauled up the islands of the Vava'u group, his [[fish hook]] catching in what is now the island of ''Hunga''. The Vava'u people attributed this great act to Tangaloa instead of [[Maui (Tongan mythology)|Maui]] due to the importance of Tangaloa worship in Vava'u. ''Tangaloa Tufunga'', though said not to be a god in [[Niuatoputapu]], is the patron of carpenters elsewhere in Tonga.

===Maui===
The ''Maui'' were special men or demigods; they appeared human. Maui drew up the islands of Ata, north of [[Tongatapu]], as well as [[Tongatapu]] with all its associated islands, then [[Lofanga]] and the other [[Ha'apai]] islands, and lastly the [[Vava'u]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="246444">[[Well-being]] is a much-studied topic in psychology, especially [[positive psychology]]. Related concepts are [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== Theories ==
Central theories are [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], [[Carol Ryff|Ryff's]] [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], [[Corey Keyes|Corey Keyes']] work on [[flourishing]], and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]]'s contributions to [[positive psychology]] and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|P.E.R.M.A.]]

Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], "eudaimonia trumps hedonism".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"&gt;Christopher Peterson (2008), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not ''What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann cover a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

The pursuit&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://thriving.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Catalino - Prioritizing Positivity (Simon-Thomas Lecture).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of happiness predicts both positive emotions and less depressive symptoms. People&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; who prioritize happiness are more psychologically able, all else held equal.

== Methodology of study ==

=== Well-being measurement ===
Different ways of measuring well-being reveal different contributing factors. The correlation between two of these, life satisfaction and happiness, in the World Values Survey (1981–2005) is only 0.47.&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/viewFile/364/477 |title=A statistical meta-analysis of the wellbeing literature |website=internationaljournalofwellbeing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are different, but related concepts which are used interchangeably outside of academia. Typically, life satisfaction, or evaluative wellbeing is measured with Cantril’s self-anchoring ladder, a questionnaire where wellbeing is rated on a scale from 1–10. Happiness or hedonic/Affective well-being measurement is measured with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), a more complex scale.

=== Limitations ===
The UK Government's Department of Health compiled a factsheet in 2014, in which it is stated that the key limitations to well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction research are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-and-health-policy|title=Wellbeing and health policy - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous associations and correlations in the body of evidence, but few causal relationships, since existing longitudinal datasets "''do not use consistent wellbeing and predictor measures at different time points''";
* After controlling for mental health status, not many of the found associations are still significant;
* Subgroup analyses are rare;
* There are too few studies to conduct meta-analyses;
* There are too few interventional studies.

== Major factors ==

=== For evaluative well-being (life satisfaction) ===
Mental health is the strongest&lt;ref&gt;[http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.as ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual predictor of life satisfaction. Mental illness is associated&lt;ref name=pmid26321990&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garaigordobil M | title = Predictor variables of happiness and its connection with risk and protective factors for health | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | pages = 1176 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26321990 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with poorer well-being. In fact, mental health is the strongest determinant of quality of life at a later age.

Studies&lt;ref name=pmid10784456&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendlowicz MV, Stein MB | title = Quality of life in individuals with anxiety disorders | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–82 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10784456 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the relationship between anxiety and quality of life.

The VOXEU&lt;ref name="voxeu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of happiness showed the principal determinants of an adult’s life satisfaction to be income, parenting, family break up, mother's mental health and schooling.
The factors that explain life satisfaction roughly map (negatively) to those factors that explain misery. They are first and foremost diagnosed depression/anxiety, which explains twice as much as the next factor, physical health (number of medical conditions), that explains just as much variance in subjective well-being between people, as income and whether someone is partnered.
These factors count twice as much as each of whether someone is employed and whether they are a non-criminal, which in turn are 3 times as important as years of education.

Overall, the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child as reported by the mother and child. It trumps factors like the qualifications that someone gets and their behaviour at 16 as reported by the mother. A child and therefore an adult's emotional health is most affected itself by a mother's mental health, which is just over twice as important as family income.
2/3 as important as family income is parent's involvement, which is 0.1 partial correlation coefficients more important than aggressive parenting (negative), father's unemployment (negative), family conflict (negative) and whether the mother worked in the subject's 1st year of life.

Whether the mother worked thereafter has 0 correlation with well-being, however. In terms of non-family factors, the place where someone goes to secondary school matters a fair bit more than observed family background altogether, which in turn is slightly more important than the place where someone went to primary school.

=== For affective well-being (happiness) ===

The main determinants of affective well-being, by correlation and effect size are:&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"/&gt;

# Corruption index (-0.54)
# Public service quality (0.40)
# GDP per capita (although, there is evidence of publication bias) (0.39)
# Economic freedom (0.35)
# Human rights violations (-0.33)
# Political and economic violence (-0.28)
# Life expectancy at birth (0.27)
# Unemployment (0.19)
# Are you married (0.07)

Determinants that correlate highly with one another, for instance, alternative ways of measuring corruption, are excluded from this list.

== Biological factors ==

=== Gender ===
Over the last 33 years, a significant decrease in women's happiness leads researchers to believe that men are happier than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=B. |last2=Wolfers |first2=J. |year=2009|title=The paradox of declining female happiness |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume= 1 |issue=2 |pages=190–225. |doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a Pew Research Centre survey found that more women are satisfied with their lives than men, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-or-women-happier.htm|title=Are men or women happier?|date=20 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found no gender gap in happiness.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Happiness Inequality in the United States |first1=Betsey |last1=Stevenson |first2=Justin |last2=Wolfers |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=S2 |pages=S33–S79 |doi=10.1086/592004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these findings could be due to the way men and women differ in calculating their happiness. Women calculate the positive self-esteem, closeness in their relationships and religion. Men calculate positive self-esteem, active leisure and mental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Gender and sources of subjective well-being | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 51 | issue = 11/12| pages = 617–629 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-004-0714-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither men nor women are at greater risk for being less happy than the other. Earlier in life, women are more likely than men to fulfill their goals (material goals and family life aspirations), thereby increasing their [[life satisfaction]] and overall happiness. However, it is later in life that men fulfill their goals, are more satisfied with their family life and financial situation and, as a result, their overall happiness surpasses that of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plagnol A, Easterlin R |title=Aspirations, attainments, and satisfaction: life cycle differences between American women and men |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=601–619 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9106-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible explanations include the unequal division of labor within the household,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mencarini L, Sironi M |title=Happiness, Housework and Gender Inequality in Europe |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=0 |issue=2 |pages=1–17 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that women experience more variance (more extremes) in emotion but are ''generally'' happier.&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap" /&gt; Effects of gender on well-being are paradoxical: men report feeling less happy than women,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, women are more susceptible to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strickland B |title=Women and depression |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=132–5 |year=1992 |jstor=20182155 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted by Siamak Khodarahimi to determine the roles of gender and age on positive psychology constructs – psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness – among 200 Iranian adolescents and 200 young adults who were questioned through various tests.

Determining whether emotions have a genetic trait or not were studied by David Lykken and Auke Tellegen. They found that up to 80% of a long-term sense of [[well-being]] is due to heredity. Basically, our families are important to our eventual emotional lives as adults because they provide us with genetic material that largely determines our base [[emotional]] responsiveness to the world. Therefore, [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is far more important to the long-term quality of our emotional lives than is learned behavior or the quality of our early childhood environment, at least as found in our current socio-economic paradigm.&lt;ref name="Lykken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykken D, Tellegen A | year = 1996 | title = Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 186–189 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining theoretical 20%, however, still leaves room for significant change in thoughts and behavior from environmental/learned sources that should not be understated, and the interpretation of variance in twin studies is controversial, even among clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://vaughanbell.net/nature-vs-nurture-is-a-lie/ |title= Nature vs nurture is a lie | last1 = Bell | first1 = Vaughan | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Psychologist | date = July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with [[self-control]], and in the facets of eudaimonia are inheritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of this trait, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.&lt;ref name="pmid22432931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archontaki D, Lewis GJ, Bates TC | title = Genetic influences on psychological well-being: a nationally representative twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–30 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22432931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
It is generally accepted that happiness is at least in part mediated through [[dopaminergic]], [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dfarhud D, Malmir M, Khanahmadi M | title = Happiness &amp; Health: The Biological Factors- Systematic Review Article | journal = Iranian Journal of Public Health | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1468–77 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 26060713 | pmc = 4449495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been found between [[hormone]] levels and happiness. [[SSRI]]s, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of [[serotonin]] in the [[Major depressive disorder|clinically unhappy]]. Researchers, such as [[Bruce K. Alexander|Alexander]], have indicated that many peoples usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Bruce K. | title=Rat Park |journal=Psychopharmacology |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato W, Kochiyama T, Uono S, Kubota Y, Sawada R, Yoshimura S, Toichi M | title = The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 16891 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586449 | pmc = 4653620 | doi = 10.1038/srep16891 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516891S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meditation]] based interventions, including [[mindfulness]], have been found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

=== Neuroscience's findings ===
[[Neuroscience]] and brain imaging have shown increasing potential for helping science understand happiness and sadness. Though it may be impossible to achieve any comprehensive objective measure of happiness, some physiological correlates to happiness can be measured. [[Stefan Klein]], in his book ''The Science of Happiness'', links the dynamics of [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] systems (i.e., dopaminergic, opiate) to the concepts and findings of positive psychology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan | last = Klein | authorlink = Stefan Klein | title = The Science of Happiness | publisher = Marlowe &amp; Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56924-328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] and researcher Cynthia Fu described very accurate diagnoses of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] just by looking at fMRI brain scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05 |title=Diagnosis – Radiolab |publisher=Wnyc.org |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By identifying [[neural correlate]]s for [[emotions]], scientists may be able to use methods like [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scans]] to tell us more about the different ways of being "happy". Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in [[positive emotions]]. He found that the left prefrontal [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative [[emotion]]s as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luz A, Dunne J, Davidson R | year = 2007 | chapter = Meditation and the neuroscience of consciousness | veditors = In Zelazo P, Moscovitch M, Thompson E | title = Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that our [[brain]] can change throughout our lives as a result of our experiences; this is known as [[neuroplasticity]].

The evolutionary perspective offers an alternative approach to understanding happiness and quality of life. Key guiding questions are: What features are included in the brain that allow humans to distinguish between positive and negative states of mind? How do these features improve humans' ability to survive and reproduce? The evolutionary perspective claims that the answers to these questions point towards an understanding of what happiness is about and how to best exploit the capacities of the brain with which humans are endowed. This perspective is presented formally and in detail by the evolutionary biologist [[Bjørn Grinde]] in his book ''[[Darwinian Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grinde | first = Bjørn | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Happiness in the perspective of evolutionary psychology | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 3 | pages = 331–354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021894227295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal factors ==

=== In relation with age ===

==== In adolescence ====
There has been a significant focus in past research on adulthood, in regards to well-being and development and although eudaimonia is not a new field of study, there has been little research done in the areas of adolescence and youth. Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects than well-being, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e. drug and alcohol use).

Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage. Adolescents rapidly face cognitive, social and physical changes, making them prime subjects to study for development and well-being. The ''eudaimonic identity theory'' was used in their research to examine the development of identity through self-discovery and self-realization. They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing one's “''daimon''” ([[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one's true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coatsworth JD, Sharp EH | title = The best within us: Positive psychology perspectives on eudaimonia | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychological Association | location  = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Researchers focused their studies on PYD ([[positive youth development]]) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of three developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.

They determined that adolescents sample multiple ''self-defining activities''; these activities aid in identity formation, as individuals choose activities that they believe represents who they are. These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent's social environments. For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.

''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman AS |title=Two conceptions of happiness: Contrasts of personal expressiveness (eudaimonia) and hedonic enjoyment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=4|pages=678–691|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment. Adolescents recognize their passions, abilities and talents and aim to fulfill their goals and behave in a way that appeases their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

The study on adolescents was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes. Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|254}} Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct the study. Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on. The PEAQ asked adolescents to self-report on activities they participate in and describe themselves with ''self-defining activities''.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|260}} It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains, as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves. The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being. They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, they have a clearer image of themselves, of what they want to achieve and higher wellness. ''Goal-setting'' was found to be a unique predictor; when adolescents work towards goals set by themselves and accomplish them, they are likely to have a clearer emerging identity and higher well-being. Researchers found that more adolescents were happy when they were involved in self-chosen activities because the activities were chosen in line with their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|257–259}}

==== In midlife ====
The [[midlife crisis]] may mark the first reliable drop in happiness during an average human's life. Evidence suggests most people generally become happier with age, with the exception of the years 40 – 50, which is the typical age at which a ''crisis'' might occur. Researchers specify that people in both their 20s and 70s are happier than during midlife, although the extent of happiness changes at different rates. For example, feelings of stress and anger tend to decline after age 20, worrying drops after age 50, and enjoyment very slowly declines in adulthood but finally starts to rise after age 50.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says.

Well-being in late life is more likely to be related to other contextual factors including proximity to death.&lt;ref name=pmid18605841&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Estabrook R, Schupp J, Wagner GG, Lindenberger U | title = Life satisfaction shows terminal decline in old age: longitudinal evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1148–59 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605841 | pmc = 3551350 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18361663&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Röcke C, Lindenberger U, Smith J | title = Decline in life satisfaction in old age: longitudinal evidence for links to distance-to-death | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–68 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18361663 | pmc = 3482430 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.23.1.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of this terminal decline in well-being could be attributed to other changes in age-normative functional declines including physical health and function.&lt;ref name=pmid24660795&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Mitchell P, Shaw J, Anstey KJ | title = Trajectories of terminal decline in the well-being of older women: the DYNOPTA project | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–56 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24660795 | doi = 10.1037/a0035370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is growing debate that assumptions that a single population estimate of age-related changes in well-being truly reflects the lived experiences of older adults has been questioned. The use of growth mixture modelling frameworks has allowed researchers to identify homogenous groups of individuals who are more similar to each other than the population based on their level and change in well-being and has shown that most report stable well-being in their late life and in the decade prior to death.&lt;ref name=pmid25108532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Byles J, Magliano DJ, Mitchell P, Anstey KJ | title = The utility of estimating population-level trajectories of terminal wellbeing decline within a growth mixture modelling framework | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–87 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25108532 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-014-0948-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are based on decades of data, and control for cohort groups; the data avoids the risk that the drops in happiness during midlife are due to populations' unique midlife experiences, like a war. The studies have also controlled for income, job status and parenting (as opposed to [[childlessness]]) to try to isolate the effects of age.

Researchers found support for the notion of age changes inside the individual that affect happiness.
This could be for any number of reasons. Psychological factors could include greater awareness of one's self and preferences; an ability to control desires and have more realistic expectations – unrealistic expectations tend to foster unhappiness; moving closer to death may motivate people to pursue personal goals; improved social skills, like forgiveness, may take years to develop – the practice of forgiveness seems linked to higher levels of happiness; or happier people may live longer and are slightly overrepresented in the elderly population. Age-related chemical changes might also play a role.&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas  | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-05-31 |access-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EcoAgeHap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17722567 |title=Age and happiness: The U-bend of life|publisher=The Economist |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found older individuals reported more health problems, but fewer problems overall. Young adults reported more anger, anxiety, depression, financial problems, troubled relationships and career stress. Researchers also suggest depression in the elderly is often due largely to passivity and inaction – they recommend people continue to undertake activities that bring happiness, even in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity restriction model of depressed affect suggests that stressors that disrupt traditional activities of daily life can lead to a decrease in mental health. The elderly population is vulnerable to activity restriction because of the disabling factors related to age. Increases in scheduled activity as well as social support can decrease the chances of activity restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with depression and languishing ===
A study by Keyes found that there are major costs of depression, which 14% of adults experience annually: it impairs social roles; it costs billions each year due to work absenteeism, diminished [[productivity]], and [[healthcare]] costs; finally, depression accounts for at least one-third of [[suicides]]. Therefore, it is important to study flourishing to learn about what is possible if issues such as depression are tackled and how the ramifications of focusing on the positive make life better not just for one person, but also for others around them.&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002" /&gt;

Flourishing has significant positive aspects magnified when compared to languishing adults and when languishing adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, languishing adults have the same amount of chronic [[disease]] as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better [[physical health]]. Languishing adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit [[Physician|doctors]] and [[therapists]] more than depressed adults.&lt;ref name="(2001).

==== Positive psychology interventions (PPI) in patients ====
A [[Strength-based practice|strengths-based approach]] to personal positive change aims to have clinical psychology place an equal weight on both positive and negative functioning when attempting to understand and treat distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth AL, Steen TA, Seligman ME | title = Positive psychology in clinical practice | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 629–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale is based on empirical findings. Because positive characteristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder the exclusive study of negative life events could produce misleading results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LH, McGowan J, Fooskas S, Rose S | title = Positive life events and social support and the relationship between life stress and psychological disorder | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–87 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6496413 | doi = 10.1007/BF00897213 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n2527h6pr72571x1/ | doi-broken-date = 2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, psychologists are looking to use positive psychology to treat patients. Amy Krentzman, among the others, discussed positive intervention as a way to treat patients. She defined positive intervention as a therapy or activity primarily aimed at increasing positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions, as opposed to focusing on negative thoughts or dysfunctional behaviors. A way of using positive intervention as a clinical treatment is to use positive activity interventions. Positive activity interventions, or PAIs, are brief self-administered exercises that promote positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Two widely used PAIs are “Three Good Things” and “Best Future Self.” “Three Good Things” requires a patient to daily document, for a week, three events that went well during the day, and the respective cause, or causes (this exercise can be modified with counterfactual thinking, that is, adding the imagination of things had them been worse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?dq=gratitude+counterfactual&amp;ei=YB2eVeC2I8Ll8AXNjYfoCA&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Qz4nhZ3ZMmgC&amp;lpg=PA332&amp;ots=CGH8m_Ee_j&amp;pg=PA332&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pSTwZDyMo3_feDWFMeADTsaiWDY&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=The Psychology of Gratitude|first1=Robert A.|last1=Emmons|first2=Michael E.|last2=McCullough | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 February 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;). “Best Future Self” has a patient “think about their life in the future, and imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. They have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of their life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of their life dreams.” The patient is then asked to write down what they imagined. These positive interventions have been shown to decrease depression,&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolier L, Haverman M, Westerhof GJ, Riper H, Smit F, Bohlmeijer E | title = Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 119 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23390882 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interventions focusing on strengths and positive emotions can, in fact, be as effective in treating disorder as other more commonly used approaches such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Steen TA, Park N, Peterson C | title = Positive psychology progress: empirical validation of interventions | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16045394 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin NL, Lyubomirsky S | title = Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 467–87 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19301241 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20593 | url = http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf | access-date = 2017-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164432/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf# | archive-date = 2012-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the apparent effect of PPIs cannot be caused by [[publication bias]], according to a [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies (2009). PPIs studied included producing gratitude letters, performing optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with people.&lt;ref name=Sin2009 /&gt;

Also, in a newer meta-analysis (39 studies, 6,139 participants, 2012), the [[standardized mean difference]] was 0.34 higher for subjective well-being, 0.20 for psychological well-being and 0.23 for depression. Three to six months after the intervention, the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant, so effects seem fairly sustainable. However, in high-quality studies the positive effect was weaker, though positive, so authors considered further high-quality studies necessary to strengthen the evidence. They claimed that the above-mentioned meta-analysis (2009) did not put enough weight on the quality of studies.
PPIs found positive included blessings, kindness practices, taking personal goals, and showing gratitude.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The interventions called "Gratitude Journaling" and "Three Good Things" seem to operate via gratitude.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt; There is evidence that, when gratitude journaling, focussing on quality over quantity as well as people more than possessions, yields greater benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal|title=Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a diminished effect from gratitude journaling if it is done more than once or twice a week. Journaling sans gratitude is effective in decreasing negative emotions in general, which suggests that the act of journaling, rather than gratitude alone, is involved in the treatment effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/romantic-relationships.aspx|title=Breakups aren't all bad: Coping strategies to promote positive outcomes|website=www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology seeks to inform clinical psychology of the potential to expand its approach, and of the merit of the possibilities. Given a fair opportunity, positive psychology might well change priorities to better address the breadth and depth of the human experience in clinical settings.

==== Post-traumatic growth ====
[[Posttraumatic growth]] (PTG) is a possible outcome after a traumatic event, besides [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Following a traumatic event, for instance rape, incest, cancer, attack, or combat, "it is normal to experience debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Reivich K, Shatte A |year=2003|title=The Resilience Factor: Seven Essential Skills For Overcoming Life's Inevitable Obstacles|publisher=Three Rivers Press|edition=Reprint|pages=9–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who shows PTG however, will experience these negative outcomes for a time and then show an increase in well-being, higher than it was before the trauma occurred. [[Martin Seligman]], a founder of positive psychology, emphasizes that "arriving at a higher level of psychological functioning than before" is a key point in PTG.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME |year=2011|title=Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and wellbeing|location=New York, NY|publisher=Free Press|chapter=Ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead an individual experiences a depressive period but recovers from an incident and returns to their normal level of psychological functioning, they are demonstrating [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; This suggests that in PTG, the trauma acts as a turning point for the person to achieve greater well-being. Seligman recognizes "the fact that trauma often sets the stage for growth" and given the right tools, individuals can make the most of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

When reflecting on a traumatic growth, Seligman suggests using the following five elements to facilitate PTG: understand the response to trauma, reduce anxiety, utilize constructive disclosure, create a trauma narrative, and articulate life principles and stances that are more robust to challenge.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; Someone experiencing PTG will achieve elements of Seligman’s "good life" theory, including a more meaningful and purposeful valuing of life, improved positive relationships, accomplishment, and a more optimistic and open mindset according to the [[Broaden-and-build|broaden-and-build theory]].&lt;ref name="pmid8827649"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tedeschi RG, Calhoun LG | title = The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: measuring the positive legacy of trauma | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–71 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8827649 | doi = 10.1002/jts.2490090305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-traumatic growth in constructive journalism ====
The phenomenon of PTG is applicable to many disciplines. The construct is important not only for just soldiers, emergency responders, and survivors of traumatic events, but on average, for everyday citizens facing typical adversity. One way to expose citizens to stories of PTG is through constructive journalism. Constructive journalism, as defined by PhD student Karen McIntyre at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, is "an emerging style of journalism in which positive psychology techniques are applied to news work with the aim of engaging readers by creating more productive news stories, all while maintaining core journalistic functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McIntyre K |year=2014|title=My current research focus is the subject of my dissertation: constructive journalism|url=http://karenmcintyre.org/research-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathrine Gyldensted, an experienced reporter with a Masters in applied positive psychology and coauthor of two books, demonstrated that typical news reporting, which is associated with negative valence, harms mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Gyldensted C |year=2011|title= Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology|type=Master Thesis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using PTG to focus on victims' strengths and instances of overcoming adversity encourages readers to implement similar ideals in their own lives. "So the goal of positive psychology in well-being theory is to measure and to build human flourishing."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011" /&gt; Combining positive psychology constructs like PTG, PERMA, and "broaden and build" with journalism could potentially improve affect and inspire individuals about the benefits of positive psychology.

PERMA not only plays a role in our own personal lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists ask the right questions to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/cathrine-gyldensted/2013072426851|title=Hurricane Sandy, Utoya, Homelessness: Constructive News out of Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affect - ratio of positive to negative affect ====
Fredrickson and Losada postulated in 2005 that the [[ratio]] of positive to negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], known as the [[critical positivity ratio]], can distinguish [[individual]]s that flourish from those that do not. Languishing was characterized by a ratio of positive to negative affect of 2.5. Optimal functioning or flourishing was argued to occur at a ratio of 4.3. The point at which flourishing changes to languishing is called the [[Losada line]] and is placed at the positivity ratio of 2.9. Those with higher ratios were claimed to have broader behavioral repertoires, greater [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]] and resilience to [[adversity]], more social [[resources]], and more optimal functioning in many areas of their life.&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F."&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678-686.&lt;/ref&gt; The model also predicted the existence of an upper limit to happiness, reached at a positivity ratio of 11.5. Fredrickson and Losada claimed that at this limit, flourishing begins to disintegrate and productivity and creativity decrease. They suggested as positivity increased, so to "appropriate negativity" needs to increase. This was described as time-limited, practicable [[feedback]] connected to specific circumstances, i.e. [[constructive criticism]].&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F." /&gt;

This positivity ratio theory was widely accepted until 2013, when Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, co-authored a paper with [[Alan Sokal]] and Harris Friedman, showing that the mathematical basis of the paper was invalid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855896&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The complex dynamics of wishful thinking: the critical positivity ratio | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 801–13 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855896 | doi = 10.1037/a0032850 | arxiv = 1307.7006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson partially retracted the paper, agreeing that the math may be flawed, but maintaining that the empirical evidence is still valid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855895&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL | title = Updated thinking on positivity ratios | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 814–22 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855895 | doi = 10.1037/a0033584 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and colleagues insist there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pmid25197848&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The persistence of wishful thinking | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–32 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25197848 | doi = 10.1037/a0037050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with basic emotions ===
Most [[psychologist]]s focus on a person's most basic [[List of emotions|emotions]]. There are thought to be between seven and fifteen basic [[emotion]]s. The [[emotion]]s can be combined in many ways to create more subtle variations of [[emotional]] experience. This suggests that any attempt to wholly eliminate negative emotions from our life would have the unintended consequence of losing the variety and subtlety of our most profound emotional experiences. Efforts to increase positive emotions will not automatically result in decreased negative [[emotion]]s, nor will decreased negative emotions necessarily result in increased positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmack, U. (2005). The structure of subjective well-being. In M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen (Eds.) The science of subjective well-being. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, pp. 97–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Feldman Barrett (1992) described emotional reactions as core affects, which are primitive emotional reactions that are consistently experienced but often not acknowledged; they blend pleasant and unpleasant as well as activated and deactivated dimensions that we carry with us at an almost unconscious level.&lt;ref name=pmid10353204&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JA, Barrett LF | title = Core affect, prototypical emotional episodes, and other things called emotion: dissecting the elephant | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–19 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353204 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests negative emotions can be damaging. In an article titled "The undoing effect of positive emotions", [[Barbara Fredrickson]] et al. hypothesized positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], they show increased [[heart rate]], higher [[blood sugar]], [[immune suppression]], and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If unregulated, the prolonged physiological activation can lead to illness, [[coronary heart disease]], and heightened mortality. Both lab and survey research substantiate that positive emotions help people under stress to return to a preferable, healthier physiological baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Mancuso RA, Branigan C, Tugade MM | title = The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotions | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–258 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 21731120 | pmc = 3128334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that improved mood is one of the various benefits of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise?

==== Behavioral repertoire ====
The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. [[happiness]], [[Interest (emotion)|interest]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]])&lt;ref name="IPP2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Compton|first=William C | name-list-format = vanc |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|year=2005|pages=23–40|chapter=2|isbn=0-534-64453-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of [[anxiety]] leads to the specific [[fight-or-flight response]] for immediate survival.&lt;ref name="IPP2"/&gt;

==== Elevation ====
After several years of researching [[disgust]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], and others, studied its opposite; the term "elevation" was coined. Elevation is a pleasant moral emotion, involving a desire to act morally and do "good". As an emotion it has a biological basis, and is sometimes characterized by a feeling of expansion in the chest or a tingling feeling on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Haidt|Haidt, Jonathan]] (2005). ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis]]''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2003). [http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.elevation-and-positive-psychology.manuscript.html Elevation and the positive psychology of morality]. In C. L. M. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (Eds.) ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. (pp.&amp;nbsp;275–289).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The concept of "flourishing" ===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

The term flourishing, in positive psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and [[psychological resilience|resilience]] (Fredrickson, 2005).&lt;ref name=pmid16221001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Losada MF | title = Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 678–86 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16221001 | pmc = 3126111 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness is made up of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth involves the use of personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life. Those who languish experience more emotional pain, psychosocial deficiency, restrictions in regular activities, and missed workdays.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; 
	
Fredrickson &amp; Losada (2005) conducted a study on university students, operationalizing positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Based on a mathematical model which has been strongly criticized,&lt;ref name=pmid23855896/&gt; and now been formally withdrawn by Fredrickson as invalid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0034435 |title='Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing': Correction to Fredrickson and Losada (2005) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=9 |page=822 |year=2013 |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L |last2=Losada |first2=Marcial F | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson &amp; Losada claimed to have discovered a [[critical positivity ratio]], above which people would flourish and below which they would not. Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). [http://www.unc.edu/peplab/publications/Fredrickson%202013%20Updated%20Thinking.pdf Updated thinking on positivity ratios]. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and [[Alan Sokal]] has pointed out that "given [Fredrickson and Losada's] experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between "flourishing" and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/fredrickson-losada-positivity-ratio-paper-partially-withdrawn/|title=Fredrickson-Losada "positivity ratio" paper partially withdrawn|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study surveyed a U.S. sample of 3,032 adults, aged 25–74. Results showed 17.2 percent of adults were flourishing, while 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy. Some common characteristics of a flourishing adult included: educated, older, married and wealthy. The study findings suggest there is room for adults to improve as less than 20 percent of Americans are living a flourishing life. (Keyes, 2002).&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | year = 2002 | title = The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life | url = | journal = Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 207–222 | doi=10.2307/3090197| jstor = 3090197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits from living a flourishing life emerge from research on the effects of experiencing a high ratio of positive to negative affect. The studied benefits of positive affect are increased responsiveness, "broadened behavioral repertoires", increased instinct, and increased perception and imagination.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; In addition, the good feelings associated with flourishing result in improvements to immune system functioning, cardiovascular recovery, lessened effects of negative affect, and frontal brain asymmetry.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Other benefits to those of moderate mental health or moderate levels of flourishing were: stronger psychological and social performance, high resiliency, greater cardiovascular health, and an overall healthier lifestyle (Keyes, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | title = Promoting and protecting mental health as flourishing: a complementary strategy for improving national mental health | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–108 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17324035 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.2.95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encountered benefits of flourishing suggest a definition: "[flourishing] people experience high levels of emotional, psychological and social well being due to vigor and vitality, self-determination, continuous self- growth, close relationships and a meaningful and purposeful life" (Siang-Yang, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siang-Yang | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = Applied Positive Psychology: Putting Positive Psychology into Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology &amp; Christianity | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
==== Happiness measurement ====
===== Oxford Happiness Questionnaire =====
Psychologists Peter Hills and [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] developed the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/ Oxford Happiness Questionnaire] by Michael Argyle and Peter Hills, a survey of current level of happiness. See also discussion in Hills, P., &amp; Argyle, M. (2002). The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire: a compact scale for the measurement of psychological well-being. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 33, 1073–1082.&lt;/ref&gt; as a broad measure of psychological well-being. The approach was criticized for lacking a theoretical model of happiness and for overlapping too much with related concepts such as [[self-esteem]], sense of purpose, social interest, [[kindness]], sense of [[humor]] and aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Todd B. | last = Kashdan | url = http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/happy.PDF | title = The assessment of subjective well-being (issues raised by the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2004 | pages = 1225–1232 | volume = 36 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00213-7 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Satisfaction with Life Scale =====
"Happiness" encompasses different emotional and mental phenomena. One method of assessment is [[Ed Diener]]'s Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to Diener, this five-question survey corresponds well with impressions from friends and family, and low incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Rather than long-term, big picture appraisals, some methods attempt to identify the amount of positive affect from one activity to the next. Scientists use beepers to remind volunteers to write down the details of their current situation. Alternatively, volunteers complete detailed diary entries each morning about the day before.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; A discrepancy arises when researchers compare the results of these short-term "experience sampling" methods, with long-term appraisals. Namely, the latter may not be very accurate; people may not know what makes their life pleasant from one moment to the next. For instance, parents' appraisals mention their children as sources of pleasure, while "experience sampling" indicates parents were not enjoying caring for their children, compared to other activities.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html |title=Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains this discrepancy by differentiating between happiness according to the "experiencing self" compared to the "remembering self": when asked to reflect on experiences, [[List of memory biases|memory biases]] like the Peak-End effect (e.g. we mostly remember the dramatic parts of a vacation, and how it was at the end) play a large role. A striking finding was in a study of [[colonoscopy]] patients. Adding 60 seconds to this invasive procedure, Kahneman found participants reported the colonoscopy as ''more'' pleasant. This was attributed to making sure the colonoscopy instrument was not moved during the extra 60 seconds – movement is the source of the most discomfort. Thus, Kahneman was appealing to the remembering self's tendency to focus on the end of the experience. Such findings help explain human error in [[affective forecasting]] – people's ability to predict their future emotional states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Humphrey Devereux by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|upright|The "remembering self" may not be the best source of information for pleasing the "experiencing self".]]

==== Changes in happiness levels ====
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Humans exhibit a variety of abilities. This includes an ability of emotional ''Hedonic Adaptation'', an idea suggesting that beauty, fame and money do not generally have lasting effects on happiness (this effect has also been called the [[Hedonic treadmill]]). In this vein, some research has suggested that only recent events, meaning those that occurred within the last 3 months, affect happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh E, Diener E, Fujita F | title = Events and subjective well-being: only recent events matter | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–102 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8656337 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency to adapt, and therefore return to an earlier level of happiness, is illustrated by studies showing lottery winners are no happier in the years after they've won.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other studies have shown [[Paraplegia|paraplegics]] are nearly as happy as control groups that are not paralyzed,&lt;ref name=Seligman2002&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Seligman | first1 = Martin E. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Martin Seligman|title = Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment | year = 2002 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-2297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; after equally few years. Daniel Kahneman explains: "they are not paraplegic full time... It has to do with allocation of attention". Thus, contrary to our [[impact bias]]es, lotteries and paraplegia do not change experiences to as great a degree as we would believe.

However, in a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref name=jgao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner J, Oswald AJ | title = Money and mental wellbeing: a longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16949692 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, adaptation can be a very slow and incomplete process. Distracting life changes such as the death of a spouse or losing one's job can show measurable changes in happiness levels for several years.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Even the "adapted" paraplegics mentioned above did ultimately report lower levels of pleasure (again, they were happier than one would expect, but not fully adapted).&lt;ref name=Diener&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/significant-results/201304/5-myths-positive-psychology|title=5 Myths of Positive Psychology| first = Robert | last = Biswas-Diener | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, adaptation is a complex process, and while it ''does'' mitigate the emotional effects of many life events it cannot mitigate them entirely.

===== Happiness set point =====
The happiness set point idea is that most people return to an average level of happiness – or a set point – after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose set points lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful most of the time and those whose set points tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; One reason that subjective well-being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well-being, the general population returns to their set point.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LyubomirskyHappiness.jpg|thumb|right|In the recipe for one person's happiness, it is nonsensical to blame one ingredient (because all are necessary). However, when comparing two people's happiness, ingredients like genetics can account for as much as half the difference.]]
In her book ''[[The How of Happiness]]'', [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] similarly argued people's happiness varies around a genetic set point. [[Robert Biswas-Diener|Diener]] warns, however, that it is nonsensical to claim that "happiness is influenced 30–50% by genetics". Diener explains that the recipe for happiness for an individual always requires genetics, environment, and behaviour too, so it is nonsensical to claim that an individual's happiness is due to only one ingredient.

Only differences in happiness can be attributed to differences in factors. In other words, Lyubomirsky's research does not discuss happiness in one individual; it discusses differences in happiness between two or more people. Specifically, Lyubomirsky suggests that 30–40% of the difference in happiness levels is due to genetics (i.e. [[heritable]]). In other words, still, Diener says it makes no sense to say one person's happiness is "due 50% to genetics", but it does make sense to say one person's difference in happiness is 50% due to differences in their genetics (and the rest is due to behaviour and environment).&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diener/&gt;

Findings from twin studies support the findings just mentioned. Twins reared apart had nearly the same levels of happiness thereby suggesting the environment is not entirely responsible for differences in people's happiness.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; Importantly, an individual's baseline happiness is not ''entirely'' determined by genetics, and not even by early life influences on one's genetics. Whether or not a person manages to elevate their baseline to the heights of their genetic possibilities depends partly on several factors, including actions and habits. Some happiness-boosting habits seem to include gratitude, appreciation, and even altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other research-based habits and techniques for increasing happiness are discussed on this page.

Besides the development of new habits, the use of antidepressants, effective exercise, and a healthier [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] have proven to affect mood significantly. There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faunalytics.org/veganism-help-reduce-stress-anxiety/|title=Does Veganism Help Reduce Stress and Anxiety? - Faunalytics|date=25 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a vegan diet reduces stress and anxiety. [[Exercise]] is sometimes called the "miracle" or "wonder" drug – alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|title=Physical Activity and Exercise: The Wonder Drug|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221329/http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/#|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimlott N | title = The miracle drug | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 407, 409 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20463262 | pmc = 2868602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that a recent book, ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]'', challenges the use of non-conservative usage of medications for mental patients, specially with respect to their long-term positive feedback effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0009/407961/20110706MartinSeligman.mp3|title=Seligman, Martin E.P. (6 July 2011). "Flourish". Royal Society of Arts. audio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation has been found to increase happiness in several studies.A study on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher [[happiness]] (Oxford happiness questionnaire) than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Evidences against the happiness set point theory =====
In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x |jstor=20183166 |title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=2016 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujita and Diener found that 24% of people changed significantly between the first five years of the study and the last five years. Almost one in four people showed changes in their well-being over the years; indeed sometimes those changes were quite dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujita F, Diener E | title = Life satisfaction set point: stability and change | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–64 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631581 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Headey found that 5–6% of people dramatically increased their life satisfaction over a 15- to 20-year period and that the goals people pursued significantly affected their life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headey | first1 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Life goals matter to happiness: A revision of set-point theory | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 312–231 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal training to increase happiness =====
The easiest and best possible way to increase one's happiness is by doing something that increases the ratio of positive to negative emotions. Contrary to some beliefs, in many scenarios, people are actually very good at determining what will increase their positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayer RE, Newman JR, McClain TM | title = Self-regulation of mood: strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 910–25 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7983582 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many techniques developed to help increase one's happiness.

A first technique is known as the "Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM)." This model proposes that long-term happiness is determined upon: (1) one's genetically determined [[#Happiness set point|set-point]], (2) circumstantial factors, and (3) intentional activities. Lyubomirsky, Sheldon and Schkade suggest to make these changes in the correct way in order to have long-term happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, Sheldon KM, Schkade D | year = 2005 | title = Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of how to increase one's happiness is through a procedure called "Hope Training." Hope Training is primarily focused on hope due to the belief that hope drives the positive emotions of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lopez SJ, Floyd RK, Ulven JC, Snyder CR |year=2000|contribution=Hope therapy: Building a house of hope|editor=C.R. Snyder|title=The handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications|pages=123–148|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This training is based on the hope theory, which states that well-being can increase once people have developed goals and believe themselves to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rand, Kevin L., &amp; Cheaven, Jennifer S|year=2009|contribution=Hope theory|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|edition=2nd |editors= Lopez, Shane, J., Snyder, C.R. |location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=323–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of hope training is to eliminate individuals from false hope syndrome. False hope syndrome particularly occurs when one believes that changing their behavior is easy and the outcomes of the change will be evidenced in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00076 |title=The False-Hope Syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=128 |year=2016 |last1=Polivy |first1=Janet |last2=Herman |first2=C. Peter  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coaching procedures based on positive psychology, which are backed by scientific research, with availability of intervention tools and assessments that positive psychology trained coaches can utilize to support the coaching process. Positive psychology coaching uses scientific evidence and insights gained in these areas to work with clients in their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biswas-Diener | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Intervention | isbn = 978-0-470-53676-6|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time and happiness ====
[[File:Slavyansky-Family portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait commemorating a family's day together]]
[[Philip Zimbardo]] suggests we might also analyze happiness from a "time perspective". He suggested the sorting of people's focus in life by valence (positive or negative) and also by their time perspective (past, present, or future orientation). Doing so may reveal some individual conflicts, not over whether an activity is enjoyed, but whether one prefers to risk delaying gratification further. Zimbardo also believes research reveals an optimal balance of perspectives for a happy life; commenting, our focus on reliving positive aspects of our past should be high, followed by time spent believing in a positive future, and finally spending a moderate (but not excessive) amount of time in enjoyment of the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time.html |title=Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "flow" ===
In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's started to study ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt; The effect of challenging situations means that flow is often temporarily exciting and variously stressful, but this is considered [[Eustress]], which is also known as "good" stress. Eustress is arguably less harmful than [[chronic stress]], although the pathways of stress-related systems are similar. Both can create a "wear and tear" effect; however, the differing physiological elements and added psychological benefits of eustress might well balance any wear and tear experienced.

Csikszentmihalyi identified nine indicator elements of flow:
1. Clear goals exist every step of the way, 2. Immediate feedback guides one's action, 3. There is a balance between challenges and abilities, 4. Action and awareness are merged, 5. Distractions are excluded from consciousness, 6. Failure is not worrisome, 7. Self-consciousness disappears, 8. Sense of time is distorted, and 9. The activity becomes "[[autotelic]]" (an end in itself, done for its own sake)&lt;ref name="In zone"&gt;{{cite web |title="In the zone": enjoyment, creativity, and the nine elements of "flow" |publisher=MeaningandHappiness.com|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/zone-enjoyment-creativity-elements-flow/26/|access-date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies also show that flow is greater during work while happiness is greater during leisure activities.&lt;ref name="Lopez, S. J. 2009. p. 200"&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

==== Addiction ====
Arguably, some people pursue ineffective shortcuts to feeling good. These shortcuts create positive feelings, but are problematic, in part because of the lack of effort involved. Some examples of these shortcuts include shopping, drugs, chocolate, loveless sex, and TV. These are problematic pursuits because all of these examples have the ability to become addictive. When happiness comes to us so easily, it comes with a price we may not realize. This price comes when taking these shortcuts is the only way to become happy, otherwise viewed as an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krentzman AR | title = Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22985057 | pmc = 3531570 | doi = 10.1037/a0029897 }} (Date is for advance online publication. The final form was published in March 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Amy Krentzman on the Application of Positive Psychology to Substance Use, Addiction, and Recovery Research, identified, in the field of positive psychology, three domains that allow an individual to thrive and contribute to society.

One of these, A Pleasant Life, involves good feelings about the past, present, and future. To tie this with addiction, they chose an example of [[alcoholism]]. Research on positive affect and alcohol showed a majority of the population associates drinking with pleasure. The pleasure one feels from alcohol is known as somatic pleasure, which is immediate but a short lived sensory delight. The researchers wanted to make clear pleasure alone does not amount to a life well lived; there is more to life than pleasure. Secondly, the Engaged Life is associated with positive traits such as strength of character. A few examples of character strength according to ''Character Strength and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification'' by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson (2004) are bravery, integrity, citizenship, humility, prudence, gratitude, and hope, all of which are shown in the rise to recovery. To descend into an addiction shows a lack of character strength; however, rising to recovery shows the reinstatement of character strengths, including the examples mentioned above. Thirdly, the Meaningful Life is service and membership to positive organizations. Examples of positive organizations include family, workplace, social groups, and society in general. Organizations, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], can be viewed as a positive organization. Membership fosters positive affect, while also promoting character strengths, which as seen in the Engaged Life, can aid in beating addiction.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt;

==== Emotional health ====
Researcher Dianne Hales described an ''emotionally healthy'' person as someone who exhibits flexibility and adaptability to different circumstances, a sense of meaning and affirmation in life, an "understanding that the self is not the center of the universe", compassion and the ability to be unselfish, an increased depth and satisfaction in intimate relationships, and a sense of control over the mind and body.&lt;ref name=twsMay18&gt;{{cite news | first = Dianne | last = Hales | name-list-format = vanc  |title= An Invitation to Health, Brief: Psychological Well-Being 2010–2011 Edition | publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning  |page=26 |year= 2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health ====
[[Richard Layard|Layard]] and others show that the most important influence on happiness is mental health.&lt;ref name="voxeu1"/&gt;

L.M. Keyes and Shane Lopez illustrate the four typologies of mental health functioning: flourishing, struggling, floundering and languishing. However, complete mental health is a combination of high emotional well-being, high psychological well-being, and high social well-being, along with low mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, C.L.M., &amp; Lopez, S.J. (2002). Toward a science of mental health: Positive directions in diagnosis and interventions. In C.R. Snyder &amp; S.J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 45–59). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health is part of well-being, some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, Snippe E, de Jonge P, Jeronimus BF | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150867 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26963923 | pmc = 4786317 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1150867B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical health ====
Meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2017 show that exercise is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, fatigue and QoL plus improvements in attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, social functioning, schizophrenic symptoms, and verbal fluency in various special populations. However, aerobic exercise has no significant effect on anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kspope.com/ethics/exercise-meta-analyses.php|title=Meta-Analyses: Exercise's Psychological &amp; Physical Effects on Health, Disorders, &amp; Quality of Life|website=kspope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study conducted by Andrew Steptow and Michael Marmot at University College London, found that happiness is related to biological markers that play an important role in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steptoe A, Wardle J, Marmot M | title = Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 18 | pages = 6508–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840727 | pmc = 1088362 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409174102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6508S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers aimed to analyze whether there was any association between well-being and three biological markers: heart rate, [[cortisol]] levels, and plasma fibrinogen levels. The participants who rated themselves the least happy had cortisol levels that were 48% higher than those who rated themselves as the most happy. The least happy subjects also had a large plasma fibrinogen response to two stress-inducing tasks: the Stroop test, and tracing a star seen in a mirror image. Repeating their studies three years later Steptow and Marmot found that participants who scored high in positive emotion continued to have lower levels of cortisol and fibrinogen, as well as a lower heart rate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Happy People Live Longer (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frey BS | title = Psychology. Happy people live longer | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6017 | pages = 542–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21292959 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201060 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Frey reported that happy people live 14% longer, increasing longevity 7.5 to 10 years and [[Richard Davidson]]'s bestseller (2012) ''The Emotional Life of Your Brain'' argues that positive emotion and happiness benefit long-term health.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, in 2015 a study building on earlier research found that happiness has no effect on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Floud S, Pirie K, Green J, Peto R, Beral V | title = Does happiness itself directly affect mortality? The prospective UK Million Women Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10021 | pages = 874–81 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26684609 | pmc = 5075047 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01087-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This "basic belief that if you're happier you're going to live longer.

Happiness does however seem to have a protective impact on immunity. The tendency to experience positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to [[Common cold|colds]] and [[Influenza|flu]] in interventional studies irrespective of other factors such as smoking, drinking, exercise, and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Doyle WJ, Turner RB, Alper CM, Skoner DP | title = Emotional style and susceptibility to the common cold | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 652–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12883117 | doi = 10.1097/01.PSY.0000077508.57784.DA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Alper CM, Doyle WJ, Treanor JJ, Turner RB | title = Positive emotional style predicts resistance to illness after experimental exposure to rhinovirus or influenza a virus | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17101814 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000245867.92364.3c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alternative medicine ====
Health consumers sometimes confuse the terms "wellness" and "well-being". Wellness is a term more commonly associated with alternative medicine which may or may not coincide with gains in subjective well-being. In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/australian-government-response-review-medicines-and-medical-devices-regulation|title=Australian Government Response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation| publisher = Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods Administration|date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government reviewed the effectiveness of numerous complementary therapies: they found low-moderate quality evidence that the Alexander technique, Buteyko, massage therapy (remedial massage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.org.au/downloads/submissions/Evidence-Based-Massage-2009.pdf |title=Evidence based massage |website=www.amt.org.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), tai chi and yoga are helpful for certain health conditions. On the other hand, the balance of evidence indicates that homeopathy, aromatherapy, bowen therapy, Feldenkrais, herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, pilates, reflexology and rolfing shiatsu were classed as ineffective.

==== Fruit and vegetable consumption ====
There is growing evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is related to greater happiness, life satisfaction, and positive mood as well. This evidence cannot be entirely explained by demographic or health variables including [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[smoking]], and [[body mass index]], suggesting a causal link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner TS, Brookie KL, Richardson AC, Polak MA | title = On carrots and curiosity: eating fruit and vegetables is associated with greater flourishing in daily life | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 413–27 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25080035 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have found that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than normal, and they also felt more positive the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White BA, Horwath CC, Conner TS | title = Many apples a day keep the blues away--daily experiences of negative and positive affect and food consumption in young adults | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–98 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23347122 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedonic well-being ===
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z |title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=17 |issue=5 |page=2023 |year=2015 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joshanloo M | title = A New Look at the Factor Structure of the MHC-SF in Iran and the United States Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26990960 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity ===
Individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being. Not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being, it also improves psychological health.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=Peggy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Identity Structures and Psychological Well-Being: Gender and Marital Status Comparisons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 1992|volume=55|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.2307/2786794|jstor=2786794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles, therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being. Each individual role is ranked internally within a [[hierarchy]] of salience. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity”.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"/&gt;

Different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being. Within this hierarchy, higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being.

[[Ethnic Group|Ethnic identity]] may play a role in an individual's cognitive well-being. Studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong, secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to [[cognitive]] well-being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phinney | first1 = Jean S. | last2 = Horenczyk | first2 = Gabriel | last3 = Liebkind | first3 = Karmela | last4 = Vedder | first4 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethnic Identity, Immigration, and Well-Being: An Interactional Perspective | journal = Journal of Social Issues |date=September 2001|volume=57|issue=3|pages=493–510|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture, therefore experiencing increased well-being.

=== Optimism and helplessness ===
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[J.B. MacKinnon]] recommended taking full responsibility for one small, but clear improvement for the world (the way energy-saving activists did by promoting a new kind of lamp). Inspired by sociological research, MacKinnon said "vertical agitation" helps reduce feelings of helplessness.]]

[[Learned optimism]] refers to development of one's potential for a [[sanguine]] outlook.{{clarify|date=May 2018}} Optimism is learned as personal efforts and abilities are linked to personally desired outcomes. In short, it is the belief one can influence the future in tangible and meaningful ways. Learned optimism contrasts with [[learned helplessness]], which consists of a belief, or beliefs, one has no control over what occurs, and that something external dictates outcomes, e.g., success. Optimism is learned by consciously challenging negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]]. This includes self talk on any event viewed as a personal failure that permanently affects all areas of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004 |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=54 |issue=7 |page=821 |year=2013 |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrapersonal, or internal, dialogues influence one's feelings. In fact, reports of happiness are correlated with the general ability to "rationalize or explain" social and economic inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conservatives Happier Than Liberals | first = Jeanna
 | last = Bryner | name-list-format = vanc |work=LiveScience.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080507-liberal-conservative.html|access-date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hope]] is a powerful positive feeling, linked to a learned style of goal-directed thinking. Hope is fostered when a person utilizes both ''pathways thinking'' (the perceived capacity to find routes to desired goals) and ''agency thinking'' (the requisite motivations to use those routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Snyder CR | year = 2000 | title = Handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[J.B. MacKinnon]] suggested the cognitive tool of "Vertical Agitation" can assist in avoiding helplessness (e.g., paralysis in the face of Earth's many problems). The concept stemmed from research on denial by sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]. Cohen explained: in the face of massive problems people tend towards learned helplessness rather than confronting the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] facts of the matter. Vertical Agitation involves focusing on one part of a problem at a time, while holding oneself accountable for solving the problem – all the way to the highest level of government, business and society (such as advocating strongly for something: [[Compact fluorescent lamp|eco-friendly lightbulbs]]). This allows each individual in society to make vital "trivial" (read: small) changes, without being intimidated by the work needed to be done as a whole. Mackinnon added: a piecemeal approach also keeps individuals from becoming too 'holier than thou' (harassing friends and family about ''every'' possible improvement), where widespread practice of Vertical Agitation would lead to much improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/Eco-Uncertainty-JB-MacKinnon-Explore.aspx |title=In an Age of Eco-Uncertainty: Vertical Agitation, Eco-Douchebags, Cohen' s Rule, and Lifestyle as Social Change |publisher=Utne.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal finances ===

Well-being has traditionally focused on improving physical, [[emotional]] and mental quality of life with little understanding of how dependent they all are on financial health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=de Chavez|first1=Anna Cronin|last2=Backett-Milburn|first2=Kathryn|last3=Parry|first3=Odette|last4=Platt|first4=Stephen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Understanding and researching wellbeing: Its usage in different disciplines and potential for health research and health promotion|journal=Health Education Journal|date=27 July 2016|volume=64|issue=1|pages=70–87|doi=10.1177/001789690506400108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, financial stress often manifests itself in physical and [[emotional]] difficulties that lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity.&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"&gt;{{cite web | authors = Main E | date = 2 March 2010 | title = Why financial stress is the costliest for your health | url = http://www.rodalenews.com/stress-health-problems | work = Rodale Wellness }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) | date = April 2014 | title = Employee financial wellness survey: 2014 results. | url = http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/private-company-services/publications/assets/pwc-employee-financial-wellness-survey-2014-results.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more inclusive paradigm for well-being would acknowledge money as a source of [[empowerment]] that maximizes physical and [[emotional]] health by reducing financial [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Alyssa | last1 = Brown | first2 = Lindsey | last2 = Sharpe | date = 7 July 2014 | name-list-format = vanc | work = Gallup | title = Americans' financial well-being is lowest, social highest. | url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/172109/americans-financial-lowest-social-highest.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Taylor M, Jenkins S, Sacker A | year = 2009 | title = Financial capability and wellbeing: Evidence from the BHPS. | publisher = UK Financial Services Authority | url = http://hb.betterregulation.com/external/OP34.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model would provide individuals with the financial knowledge they need, as well as enable them to gain valuable insight and understanding regarding their financial habits, as well as their thoughts, feelings, fears and attitudes about money.

It has been argued that money cannot effectively "buy" much happiness unless it is used in certain ways, and that "Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house themselves, having more money – even a lot more money – makes them only a little bit happier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett|first1=Drake | name-list-format = vanc | title = Happiness: A buyer’s guide | url = http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/23/happiness_a_buyers_guide/ |access-date=1 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=23 August 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'', psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] described research suggesting money makes a significant difference to the poor (where basic needs are not yet met), but has a greatly diminished effect once one reaches middle class (i.e. the [[Easterlin paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin RA, McVey LA, Switek M, Sawangfa O, Zweig JS | title = The happiness-income paradox revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 52 | pages = 22463–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21149705 | pmc = 3012515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015962107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10722463E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every dollar earned is just as valuable to happiness up to a $75,000 annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/|title=Everything you need to know about whether money makes you happy - 80,000 Hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereafter, the value of each additional dollar earns a diminishing amount of happiness. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g80/artiklar/1.421852/Happywhatmakesus.pdf|title=Linköping University|website=www.iei.liu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, one's perception of their financial circumstances fully mediates the effects of objective circumstances on one’s well-being. People overestimate the influence of wealth by 100%.&lt;ref name=Aknin09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17439760903271421 |title=From wealth to well-being?

Professor of Economics [[Richard Easterlin]] noted that [[job satisfaction]] does not depend on salary. In other words, having extra money for luxuries does not increase happiness as much as enjoying one's job or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin R |year=2008|title=Income and happiness: towards a unified theory|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=11|issue=473|pages=465–484|doi= 10.1111/1468-0297.00646|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/easterlin2001a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert is thus adamant, people should go to great lengths to figure out which jobs they would enjoy, and to find a way to do one of those jobs for a living (that is, provided one is also attentive to social ties).

Unemployment is detrimental to individual well-being. However, that does not hold true in countries where unemployment is widespread. Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201110/preserving-mental-health-during-unemployment|title=Preserving Mental Health During Unemployment|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the impact of unemployment is dampened in those for whom work is less central to their identity, those who receive less criticism and less negative judgments from others, those who can meet their immediate financial obligations and those who do not see their unemployment as high stress and negative. Other protective factors include the expectation of reemployment, routines that structure one's time and evaluating oneself as worthy, competent and successful. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, unemployment is worse for wellbeing for those that are right wing or live in high income countries. Not all unemployment is bad, however: international data from sixteen Western countries indicates that retirement at any age yields large increases in subjective well-being that returns to trend by age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2|title=Subjective Well-Being and Retirement: Analysis and Policy Recommendations | first = Elizabeth Mokyr | last = Horner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=125–144|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive coaching, a workplace intervention for well-being and performance, is proven to work in certain contexts, according to a 2013 independent quantitative scientific summary synthesising high quality scientific research on coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadingchangenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Structuring-and-Understanding-the-Coaching-Industry.pdf |title=Structure and understanding |website=leadingchangenetwork.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that standard effect sizes for the outcomes of performance/skills, well-being, coping, goal-attainment and work/career attitudes range from 0.43 to 0.74.

A more recent study has challenged the [[Easterlin paradox]]. Using recent data from a broader collection of countries, a positive link was found between GDP and well-being; and there was no point at which wealthier countries' subjective well-being ceased to increase. It was concluded economic growth does indeed increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stevenson, B., Wolfers, J.|year=2008|title=Economic growth and subjective well-being: Reassessing the Easterlin paradox|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–102|doi=10.3386/w14282|url=http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation between money and emotional well-being is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Deaton A | title = High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 38 | pages = 16489–93 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20823223 | pmc = 2944762 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011492107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716489K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of money may lead people to ignore leisure time and relationships, both of which may cause and contribute to happiness.&lt;ref name=Aknin09/&gt; The pursuit of money at the risk of jeopardizing one's personal relationships and sacrificing enjoyment from one's leisure activities seems an unwise approach to finding happiness.

Money, or its hectic pursuit, has been shown to hinder people's [[savoring]] ability, or the act of enjoying everyday positive experiences and emotions. In a study looking at working adults, wealthy individuals reported lower levels of savoring ability (the ability to prolong positive emotion) relative to their poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quoidbach J, Dunn EW, Petrides KV, Mikolajczak M | title = Money giveth, money taketh away: the dual effect of wealth on happiness | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–63 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20483819 | doi = 10.1177/0956797610371963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottery winners report higher levels of happiness immediately following the event. But research shows winner's happiness levels drop and return to normal baseline rates within months to years.

Specifically, using subjective well-being data from China, the authors find that homeownership is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, although this happiness premium is larger for people who have full ownership compared to those who have only a minor ownership stake in their home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.10.001 |title=Institutions and well-being |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=45 |page=1 |year=2016 |last1=Bennett |first1=Daniel L |last2=Nikolaev |first2=Boris |last3=Aidt |first3=Toke S  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, living in rural areas seems to have some association with well-being, because the included studies tend to control for income and rural areas tend to be poor. Income has a high effect on happiness and incomes are higher in urban areas, so chasing a rural lifestyle at the expense of income may be a ‘grass is always greener’ move.

Adults who live with parents also tend to have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/living-at-home-with-your-parents/8135918|title=Adults living with their parents are Australia’s least happy, survey finds|first=Ange|last=McCormack | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorer levels of well-being.

=== Mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
[[File:Rollercoaster Tornado Avonturenpark Hellendoorn Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Researchers recommend attending to the past to find fond memories, and the future to find hope, but ultimately focussing mostly on the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime/&gt; Daydreaming usually precedes drops in happiness. Mindfulness and activities that bring focus to the present (like roller coasters) may bring happiness partly by shifting people's focus away from the slightly saddening question "Am I happy?".&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering/&gt;&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment/&gt;]]

[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] is an intentionally focused awareness of one's immediate experience. "Focused awareness" is a conscious moment-by-moment attention to situational elements of an experience: i.e., thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and surroundings. An aim of mindfulness is to become grounded in the present moment; one learns to observe the arising and passing of experience. One does not judge the experiences and thoughts, nor do they try to "figure things out" and draw conclusions, or change anything – the challenge during mindfulness is to simply observe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J. (2003) Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom, Shambala, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gunaratana H | year=1992|title=Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=Wisdom Publications|quote="It should be noted that mindfulness is not an evolving term. It has a very distinct longstanding meaning that has remained the same since it was introduced over 2500 years ago. The practice is challenging and requires determination and dedication, particularly when one is starting out. As time passes, the practice becomes more natural."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of mindfulness practice include reduction of stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KW, Ryan RM, Creswell JD  | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness: Theoretical foundations and evidence for its salutary effects | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 211–237 | doi=10.1080/10478400701598298}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reverence (emotion)]].

Ellen J. Langer argued people slip into a state of "mindlessness" by engaging in rote behavior, performing familiar, scripted actions without much cognition, as if on autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wayne | last1 = Weiten | first2 = Dana S. | last2 = Dunn | first3 = Elizabeth Yost | last3 = Hammer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of focusing on present experiences also mention research by Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], who suggested daydreaming, instead of a focus on the present, may impede happiness.&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killingsworth MA, Gilbert DT | title = A wandering mind is an unhappy mind | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6006 | pages = 932 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21071660 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192439 | bibcode = 2010Sci...330..932K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=When the Mind Wanders, Happiness Also Strays | first = John | last = Tierney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2010-11-15|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1&amp;hp|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found evidence to support the harm of daydreaming. Fifteen thousand participants from around the world provided over 650 000 reports (using an online application on their phones that requested data at random times). Killingsworth found people who reported daydreaming soon reported less happiness; daydreaming is extremely common.&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html |title=Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment|work=ted.com|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo (see "Time Perspectives" above) bestowed the merits of a present-focus, and recommended occasional recall of past positive experiences. Reflecting on past positive experiences can influence current mood, and assist in building positive expectations for the future.

There is research that suggests a person's focus influences level of happiness, where thinking too much about happiness can be counter-productive. Rather than asking: "Am I happy?" – which when posed just 4 times a day, starts to decrease happiness, it might well be better to reflect on one's values (e.g., "Can I muster any hope?").&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/06/20/say-no-to-happiness/|publisher=CBC Ideas|title=Say no to happiness|time=about 10 minutes in| first = Todd | last = Kashdan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking different questions can assist in redirecting personal thoughts, and perhaps, lead to taking steps to better apply one's energies. The personal answer to any particular question can lead to positive actions, and hopefulness, which is a very powerful, and positive feeling. Hopefulness is more likely to foster happiness, while feelings of hopelessness tend to undermine happiness.

Todd Kashdan, researcher and author of "Designing Positive Psychology", explained early science's findings should not be overgeneralized or adopted too uncritically. Mindfulness to Kashdan is very resource-intensive processing; he warned it is not simply better at all times. To illustrate, when a task is best performed with very little conscious thought (e.g., a paramedic performing practiced, emergency maneuvers).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Nevertheless, development of the skill lends to its application at certain times, which can be useful for the reasons just described; Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry Richard J. Davidson highly recommends "mindfulness [[meditation]]" for use in the accurate identification and management of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/training-the-emotional-brain|title=Training the Emotional Brain – An Interview with Richard J.

Some schools of thought, such as [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), have been criticised as pseudoscience.

[[Ed Diener]] et al. (1999) suggested this equation: positive emotion – negative emotion = subjective well-being. Since tendency to positive emotion has a correlation of 0.8 with [[extroversion]] and tendency towards negative emotion is indistinguishable from [[neuroticism]], the above equation could also be written as extroversion – neuroticism = happiness. These two traits could account for between 50% to 75% of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diener | first1 = Ed | last2 = Suh | first2 = Eunkook M. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Heidi L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1999 |volume=125|issue=2|pages=276–302|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all referring to the [[Big Five personality traits]] model of personality.

An emotionally stable (the opposite of [[Neuroticism|Neurotic]]) [[personality psychology|personality]] correlates well with happiness. Not only does emotional stability make one less prone to negative emotions, it also predicts higher social intelligence – which helps to manage relationships with others (an important part of being happy, discussed below).&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap"/&gt;

Cultivating an [[Extroversion|extroverted]] [[temperament]] may correlate with happiness for the same reason: it builds relationships and support groups. Some people may be fortunate, from the standpoint of [[Personality psychology|personality theories]] that suggest individuals have control over their long-term behaviors and cognitions. Genetic studies indicate genes for personality (specifically [[extroversion]], [[neuroticism]] and [[conscientiousness]]), and a general factor linking all 5 traits, account for the heritability of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A, Bates TC, Luciano M | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18315789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests there is a happiness gene, the 5-HTT gene.&lt;ref name="Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Happiness Gene Located | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224536.php | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose in life ===
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction. It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction. They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose. Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life). Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.

The [[self-control]] approach, as expounded by [[C. R. Snyder]], focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success. This is further reinforced by a sense of intentionality in both efforts and outcomes.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=David B.|last2=Snyder|first2=C. R.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Hope and the Meaningful Life: Theoretical and Empirical Associations Between Goal–Directed Thinking and Life Meaning|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|year=2005|pages=401–421|issn=0736-7236|doi=10.1521/jscp.24.3.401.65616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intrinsic motivation]] approach of [[Viktor Frankl]] emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness. Attitudinal values are prominent for individuals who are unable to pursue the preceding two classes of values. Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

A personal sense of responsibility is required for the pursuit of the values that give life meaning, but it is the realization that one holds sole responsibility for rendering life meaningful that allows the values to be actualized and life to be given true purpose. Determining what is meaningful for one's self provides a sense of autonomy and control which promotes self-esteem.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism. However, it has also been found to decrease with age.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one's lifetime.&lt;ref name="RyffSinger2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=9|issue=1|year=2006|pages=13–39|issn=1389-4978|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the above theories have self-esteem at their core. Self-esteem is often viewed as the most significant measure of psychological well-being, and highly correlated with many life-regulating skills. Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.

=== Self-efficacy ===
[[Self-efficacy]] refers to a belief that one's ability to accomplish a task is a function of personal effort. Low self-efficacy, or a disconnect between ability and personal effort, is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; by comparison, high self-efficacy is associated with positive change, including overcoming abuse, overcoming eating disorders, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. High self-efficacy also has positive benefits for one's [[immune system]], aids in stress management, and decreases pain.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; A related concept, [[Personal effectiveness]], is primarily concerned with planning and the implementation of methods of accomplishment.

=== Sports ===
According to Bloodworth and McNamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of people's well-being. The influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence, its [[hedonistic]] shallowness and its [[epistemological]] inadequacy.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports, a deficiency in studying this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bloodworth | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Mike | last2 = McNamee | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sport, physical activity and well-being: An objectivist account|journal=Sport, Education and Society|date=August 2012|volume=17|issue=4|page=18|doi=10.1080/13573322.2011.608948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalai Lama and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|According to Peterson, the Buddhist saying that "life is suffering" can be understood as a reality that humans must accept, as well as a call to cultivate virtues.]]
In reference to the Buddhist saying "Life is suffering", researcher and clinical psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]] suggested this view as realistic, not pessimistic, where acceptance of the reality life is harsh, provides a freedom from the expectation one should always be happy. This realization can assist in the management of inevitable suffering. To Peterson, virtues are important because they provide people with essential tools to escape suffering (e.g., the strength to admit [[cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] truths to themselves). Peterson maintained suffering is made worse by false philosophy (i.e., denial that natural suffering is inevitable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?videoid%3F713852509001 |title=TVO.ORG &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; TVO – Jordan Peterson on The Necessity of Virtue |publisher=TVO |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-07 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] believes positive psychology is "not a luxury", saying "most of Positive Psychology is for all of us, troubled or untroubled, privileged or in privation, suffering or carefree. The pleasures of a good conversation, the strength of gratitude, the benefits of kindness or wisdom or spirituality or humility, the search for meaning and the antidote to "fidgeting until we die" are the birthrights of us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=52 |title=Martin P Seligman.

Positive coping is defined as "a response aimed at diminishing the physical, emotional, and psychological burden that is linked to stressful life events and daily hassles"&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Dinoff, B. L. (1999). Coping: Where have you been? In C. R. Snyder (Ed.), ''Coping: The psychology of what works'' (pp. 3–19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that proper coping strategies will reduce the burden of short-term stress and will help relieve long-term stress. Stress can be reduced by building resources that inhibit or buffer future challenges. For some people, these effective resources could be physiological, psychological or social.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"/&gt;

=== Terror management ===
[[Terror management theory]] maintains that people suffer [[cognitive dissonance]] (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements – symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).

Research has found that strong belief in religious ''or'' secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vail KE, Rothschild ZK, Weise DR, Solomon S, Pyszczynski T, Greenberg J | title = A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–94 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19940284 | doi = 10.1177/1088868309351165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2011/03/episode-81-sacrificial-lambs.html|title=Reasonable Doubts: Episode 81 Sacrificial Lambs|author=Fletcher|work=doubtreligion.blogspot.com}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silton NR, Flannelly KJ, Galek K, Ellison CG | title = Beliefs about God and mental health among American adults | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 1285–96 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 23572240 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the world's poorest countries are the most likely to be religious, and researchers suggest this is because of religion's powerful coping abilities.&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations], Gallup Global Reports, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor], Gallup Global Reports, March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Galen also supports terror management theory as a partial explanation of the above findings.

== Relational factors ==

=== Love and caring ===
The capacity for loving attachments and relationships, especially with parents, is the strongest predictor of well-being later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vaillant|first1=George E. | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=George Eman Vaillant|title=Triumphs of Experience|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067424|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20relationship&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|date=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] writes: "Unlike money, which has at most a small effect, marriage is robustly related to happiness... In my opinion, the [[Correlation does not imply causation|jury is still out on what causes]] the proven fact married people are happier than unmarried people." (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt;). Married persons report higher levels of happiness and well-being than single people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orden SR, Bradburn NM |title=Dimensions of Marriage Happiness |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=715–731 |date=May 1968 |jstor=2775777 |doi=10.1086/224565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data has shown a spouse's happiness depends on the happiness of their partner. When asked, spouses reported similar happiness levels to each other. The data also shows the spouses' happiness level fluctuates similarly to one another. If the husband is having a bad week, the wife will similarly report she had a bad week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoppmann CA, Gerstorf D, Willis SL, Schaie KW | title = Spousal interrelations in happiness in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: considerable similarities in levels and change over time | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21038942 | pmc = 3133667 | doi = 10.1037/a0020788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little data on alternatives like [[polyamory]], although one study stated wife order in polygyny did not have a substantial effect on life or marital satisfaction over all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwanfogbe PN, Schumm WR, Smith M, Furrow JL |title=Polygyny and marital/life satisfaction: An exploratory study from rural Cameroon |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=55–71  |date=January 1997|jstor=41603479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found younger wives were happier than older wives.

On the other hand, at least one large study in Germany found no difference in happiness between married and unmarried people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200303/marriage-is-not-the-key-happiness|title=&lt;/font&gt;Marriage Is Not the Key to Happiness| first = Anne | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that married couples are consistently happier and more satisfied with their life than those who are single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Diener E, Suh EM |year=2000|title=Culture and subjective well-being|location=&lt;/font&gt;Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research findings have indicated that marriage is the only real significant bottom-up predictor of life satisfaction for men and women, and that those people who have a higher life satisfaction prior to marriage, tend to have a happier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Diener, M., &amp; Diener McGavran, M. B.|year=2008|contribution=What makes people happy? A developmental approach to the literature on family relationships and well-being|editors=M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen|title=The science of subjective well-being|pages=347–375|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reported satisfaction typically drops as the years of marriage roll on, particularly for couples who have children compared to those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201710/defy-the-odds-heres-how-keep-your-relationship-happy|title=Defy the Odds: Here's How to Keep Your Relationship Happy|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decline include a drop in affectionate behaviour. One team of researcher from Northwestern University who summarised the literature in 2013, identifies that this trend does not reverse throughout the marital period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_FinkelSlotterLuchiesWaltonGross_PSci_000.pdf |title=A Brief Intervention to Promote Conflict Reappraisal Preserves Marital Quality Over Time |website=faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the positive relationship between marriage and well-being in the United States since the 1970s. This decline is due to women reporting being less happy than previously and single men reporting being happier than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn ND, Weaver CN | year = 1988 | title = The changing relationship of marital status to reported happiness | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 317–324 | doi=10.2307/351999| jstor = 351999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does exist, however, suggesting that compared to single people, married people have better physical and psychological health and tend to live longer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.043 |title=Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married? |journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=326 |year=2006 |last1=Stutzer |first1=Alois |last2=Frey |first2=Bruno S  | name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, a two-factor theory of love was developed by Barnes and Sternberg. This theory is composed of two components: passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is considered to be an intense longing for a loved one. This love is often experienced through joy and sexual fulfillment, or even through rejection. On the other hand, companionate love is associated with affection, friendship and commitment. Stutzer and Frey (2006) found that the absence of loneliness and the emotional support that promotes self-esteem are both important aspects that contribute to individual well-being within marriage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both passionate and companionate love are the foundations for every variety of love that one may experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes ML, Sternberg RJ | year=1997|contribution=A hierarchical model of love and its prediction of satisfaction in close relationships|editors=R. J. Sternberg &amp; M. Hojjatt|title=Satisfaction in close relationships|pages=79–101|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; When passionate and companionate love are compromised in a marital relationship, satisfaction is decreased and the likelihood of divorce increases.&lt;ref name=pmid26168263&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan KT, Pasch LA, Lawrence E, Bradbury TN | title = Physical aggression, compromised social support, and 10-year marital outcomes: Testing a relational spillover model | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 931–7 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26168263 | doi = 10.1037/fam0000125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the lack of positive support and validation increases the risk for divorce.

Because of the expansive research done on the significance of social support within a marriage, it is important to understand that this research was inspired by a theory called the attachment theory perspective. Attachment theory stresses the importance of support and care giving in a relationship for the development of trust and security. Attachment theory, as conceptualized by Collins and Feeney (2000) is an interpersonal, transactional process that involves one partners caregiving responses.&lt;ref name=pmid10870908&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins NL, Feeney BC | title = A safe haven: an attachment theory perspective on support seeking and caregiving in intimate relationships | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–73 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870908 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthood ===
While the mantle of parenting is sometimes held as the necessary path of adulthood, study findings are actually mixed as to whether parents report higher levels of happiness relative to non-parents. Folk wisdom suggests a child brings partners closer; research has found couples actually become less satisfied after the birth of the first child.&lt;ref name=Twenge03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00574.x |title=Parenthood and Marital Satisfaction: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=574 |year=2003 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Campbell |first2=W. Keith |last3=Foster |first3=Craig A  |name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joys of having a child are overshadowed by the responsibilities of parenthood.&lt;ref name=Evenson05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evenson RJ, Simon RW | title = Clarifying the relationship between parenthood and depression | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 341–58 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16433280 | doi = 10.1177/002214650504600403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on quantitative self-reports, researchers found parents prefer doing almost anything else to looking after their children. By contrast, parents' self-report levels of happiness are higher than those of non-parents. This may be due to already happy people having more children than unhappy people. In addition, it might also be that, in the long-term, having children gives more meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By contrast, many studies found having children makes parents less happy. Compared with non-parents, parents with children have lower levels of well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Umberson D, Gove W |title=Parenthood and psychological well-being: theory, measurement, and stage in the family life course |journal=Journal of Family Issues |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=440–462 |year=1989 |doi=10.1177/019251389010004002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents report more feelings of depression&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; and anxiety&lt;ref name=McLanahan87&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLanahan S, Adams J |title=Parenthood and psychological well-being |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=13 |pages=237–257 |year=1987 |jstor=2083248 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.13.1.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; than non-parents. However, when adults without children are compared to empty nest parents, parenthood is positively associated with emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; People found parenthood to be more stressful in the 1970s than they did in the 1950s. This is thought to be because of social changes in regards to employment and marital status.&lt;ref name=McLanahan87/&gt;

Males apparently become less happy after the birth of a child due to added economic pressure and taking on the role of being a parent.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; A conflict between partners can arise when the couple does not desire traditional roles, or has an increasing number of roles.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; Unequal responsibilities of child-rearing between men and women account for this difference in satisfaction. Fathers who worked and shared an equal part in child-raising responsibilities were found to be the least satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, E., Smith, K. (1996). ''Parenting in the 1990s''. London: Family Policy Studies Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that single parents have higher levels of distress and report more mental health problems than married persons.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt;

Researchers implemented the Huta &amp; Ryan Scale: Four Eudaimonic Measurement Questionnaire to analyze the participants eudaimonic motives, through motivation towards activities. The investigation was conducted on Canadian university undergraduates. The four eudaimonic pursuits as described by Huta &amp; Ryan are: 
# "Seeking to pursue excellence or a personal ideal" 
# "Seeking to use the best in yourself" 
# "Seeking to develop a skill, learn, or gain insight into something" 
# "Seeking to do what you believe in".&lt;ref name="Huta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huta|first1=Veronika|title=Huta, Veronika. "Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of Their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling. |journal=Journal of Happiness|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study determined that participants derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their parents had role modeled eudaimonia, but not if their parents had merely verbally endorsed eudaimonia.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

Studies were also conducted on responsiveness and demandingness. The studies participants were American university undergraduates. The terms are described as follows; responsiveness satisfies the basic psychological need for autonomy. This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one's behaviour's values, and true-self. Autonomy is an important psychological factor because it provides the individual with independence. Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision. Responsiveness and demandingness are reported to be good aspects of parenting. The studies report both of these qualities as important factors to well-being.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind's Parent Behaviour Rating Interview. Adaptions of this interview were made into a seventy-five question based survey; participants answered questions organized into fifteen subscales. The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them. A [[multiple regression]] showed that demandingness and responsiveness together explained as much as twenty-eight percent of the variance in eudaimonia, this suggests parenting played a major role in the development of this pursuit. This supported the expectation that eudaimonia is cultivated when parents encourage internal structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision, and simultaneously fulfill a child's needs for autonomy. The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves "mentor" their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia. To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood. Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

=== Social ties ===
In the article "Finding Happiness after Harvard", [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]] concluded a study on what aspects of life are important for "successful living". In the 1940s, Arlie Bock, while in charge of the Harvard Health Services, started a study, selecting 268 Harvard students from graduating classes of 1942, '43, and '44. He sought to identify the aspects of life contributing to "successful living". In 1967, the psychiatrist George Vaillant continued the study, undertaking follow-up interviews to gauge the lives of many of the students. In 2000, Vaillant again interviewed these students as to their progress in life. Vaillant observed: health, close relationships, and how participants dealt with their troubles. Vaillant found a key aspect to successful living is healthy and strong relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shenk J |title=Finding happiness After Harvard |journal=Wilson Quarterly |volume=33 |pages=73–74 |date=Autumn 2009 |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501 |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027190526/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501# |archive-date=2012-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized study from 2008 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported happiness in [[social network]]s may spread from person to person.&lt;ref name=Fowler08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler JH, Christakis NA | title = Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = 768 | pages = a2338 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19056788 | pmc = 2600606 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2338 | author1-link = James H. Fowler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers followed nearly 5000 individuals for 20 years in the long-standing [[Framingham Heart Study]] and found clusters of happiness and unhappiness that spread up to 3 degrees of separation on average. Happiness tended to spread through close relationships like friends, siblings, spouses, and next-door neighbors; researchers reported happiness spread more consistently than unhappiness through the network. Moreover, the structure of the social network appeared to affect happiness, as people who were very central (with many friends, and friends of friends) were significantly happier than those on the network periphery. People closer with others are more likely to be happy themselves.&lt;ref name=Fowler08/&gt; Overall, the results suggest happiness can spread through a population like a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/health/05happy-web.html|title=Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says  |publisher=New York Times|date=December 5, 2008 | first=Pam | last=Belluck | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Stein,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403537.html "Happiness Can Spread Among People Like a Contagion, Study Indicates,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2008, Page A08&lt;/ref&gt; Having a best friend buffers one's negative life experiences.

Neuroeconomist Paul Zak studies morality, oxytocin, and trust, among other variables. Based on research findings, Zak recommends: people hug others more often to get into the habit of feeling trust. He explains "eight hugs a day, you'll be happier, and the world will be a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html|title=Trust, morality -- and oxytocin?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Anderson et al. found that [[sociometric status]] (the amount of respect one has from face-to-face peer group) is significantly and causally related to happiness as measured by [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson C, Kraus MW, Galinsky AD, Keltner D | title = The local-ladder effect: social status and subjective well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22653798 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611434537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anders Ericsson]] argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like [[Theoretical physics]], where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of an Expert

Studies has shown that enjoyment in things as simple as role playing increases a person's IQ and their happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klesen|first1=M|title=Using Theatrical Concepts for Role-plays with Educational Agents|date=2005|doi=10.1080/08839510590910237|volume=19|issue=3–4|journal=Applied Artificial Intelligence|pages=413–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Seligman]] has said: "As a professor, I don't like this, but the cerebral virtues—curiosity, love of learning—are less strongly tied to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude and capacity for love."&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;

=== Educational goals ===
John White (2013) investigated the educational goals at public schools in Britain. School-education involves both cognitive and conceptual [[learning]], but also the development social skills and personal development. Ideally, children develop self-confidence, and create purpose for themselves. According to White, in the past schools only focused on [[knowledge]] and [[education]] but now [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has moved to a broader direction. White's Every Child Matters initiative seeks to enhance children's well-being across the range of children's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=John| name-list-format = vanc |title=Education in Well-Being|journal=The Oxford handbook of happiness|pages=540–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical education ====
As a basic building block to a better existence, positive psychology aims to improve the quality of experiences. Within its framework, students could learn to become excited about physical activity. Playing comes natural to children; positive psychology seeks to preserve this zest (a sense of excitement and motivation for life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = January 18, 2013|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = |last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for movement in growing and developing children. If offered in an interesting, challenging and pleasurable way physical activity would thus internalize an authentic feeling of happiness in students. Positive psychology's approach to physical activity could give students the means of acquiring an engaged, pleasant and meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherubini|first=Jeffrey| name-list-format = vanc |title=Positive Psychology and Quality Physical Education|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=September 2009|volume=80|issue=7|pages=42–47, 51|doi=10.1080/07303084.2009.10598356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School education ====
&lt;!-- I don't object to the addition of this study, but it is not appropriately concise, and should accordingly be drastically cut down. --&gt;
Positive psychology is beneficial to schools and students because it encourages individuals to strive to do their best, whereas scolding has the opposite effect. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"&gt;Clifton, D, Rath, T 2005, ‘Every moment matters’, How full is your bucket? Positive strategies for work and life, Gallup Press, New York, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; discussed research conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Hurlock in 1925, where fourth, fifth and sixth graders were either praised, criticized or ignored, based on their work on math problems. Praised students improved by 71%, those criticized improved by 19%, and students provided with no feedback improved a mere 5%. Praise seems an effective method of fostering improvement.

According to Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; ninety nine out of one hundred people prefer the influence of positive people. The benefits include: increased productivity, and contagious positive emotions, which assists one in working to the best of her, or his, abilities. Even a single negative person can ruin the entire positive vibe in an environment. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; cited ‘positive emotions as an essential daily requirement for survival’.

In 2008, in conjunction with the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a whole-of-school implementation of Positive Psychology was undertaken by Geelong Grammar School (Victoria, Australia). This involved training of teaching staff in the principles and skills of positive psychology. Ongoing support was provided by The Positive Psychology Center staff, who remained in-residence for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman M, Ernst R, Gillham J, Reivich K, Links M |title=Positive education: positive psychology and classroom interventions |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=293–311 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/03054980902934563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats, Hupp and Hagley (2008) used positive psychology to explore academic honesty. They identified positive traits displayed by heroes, then determined if the presence of these traits in students predicted future intent to cheat. The results of their research: ‘an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment’ (Staats, Hupp &amp; Hagley, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staats S, Hupp JM, Hagley AM | title = Honesty and heroes: a positive psychology view of heroism and academic honesty | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18792648 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.142.4.357-372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School grades of children ====
According to a study reported in the ''NY Post'' newspaper, 48% of parents reward their children's good grades with cash or something else of meaning. Among many families in the United States, this is controversial. Although psychology experts support the offer of reward for good behavior as a better alternative than the use of punishment for bad behavior, in some circumstances, families cannot afford to give their children an average of 16 dollars for every good grade earned. Alternatives for money include allowing a child extra time on a computer or staying up later than usual. Some psychology experts believe the best reward is praise and encouragement because material rewards can cause long-term negative effects for children.
 
A study, regarding rewards for children, conducted in 1971 by psychologist, Edward L. Deci, at the University of Rochester, is still referenced today. Featured in the ''New York Times'', it focused on the short- and long-term effects of rewards for positive behavior. Deci suggested rewards for positive behavior is an effective incentive for only a short period. At the outset, rewards can support motivation to work hard and strive towards personal goals. However, once rewards cease, children showed less interest in the task relative to participants who never received rewards. Deci pointed out, at a young age, children's natural instinct is to resist people who try to control their behavior, which he cited as support for his conclusion rewards for good behavior have limited effectiveness.

In contrast, the ''New York Times'' featured research findings that supported the merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy regarding the use of rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards at the beginning of the school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, no one method will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Youth development ====
[[Positive Youth Development]] focuses on the promotion of healthy development rather than viewing youth as prone to problems needing to be addressed. This is accomplished through programs and efforts by communities, schools, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="website- Aspe.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Youth Development in the U.S.: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/PositiveYouthDev99/index.htm|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Happiness at work}}

It has been argued that [[happiness at work]] is one of the driving forces behind positive outcomes at work, rather than just being a resultant product.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Lyubomirsky S |title=Does Happiness Promote Career Success? |journal=Journal of Career Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=101–16 |doi=10.1177/1069072707308140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a large body of positive [[psychological research]] into the relationship between happiness and productivity,&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;Carr, A.: "Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Human Strengths" Hove, Brunner-Routledge 2004{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isen |first1=A. |chapter=Positive Affect and Decision-making |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Emotions |edition=2nd  |pages=417–36 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11392858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buss DM | title = The evolution of happiness | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11392858 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; happiness at work has traditionally been seen as a potential by-product of positive outcomes at work, rather than a pathway to success in business. However a growing number of scholars, including Boehm and Lyubomirsky, argue that it should be viewed as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16351326&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Resource Management ====
A practical application of positive psychology is to assist individuals and organizations in identifying strengths so as to increase and sustain well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, various psychological professionals, HR departments, business strategists, and others, are using new methods and techniques to broaden and build upon the strengths of a wide population of individuals. This includes those not suffering from mental illness or disorder. &lt;!-- The phrase "broaden and build" is a reference to the prominent positive psychology theory of Barbara Fredrickson. --&gt;

==== Workplace ====
{{main|Positive psychology in the workplace}}
Positive psychology has been implemented in business management practice, but has faced challenges. Wong &amp; Davey (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/sl_proceedings/2007/wong-davey.pdf |title=Wong &amp; Davey (2007) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted managers can introduce positive psychology to a workplace, but they might struggle with positive ways to apply it to employees. Furthermore, for employees to welcome and commit to positive psychology, its application within an organization must be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. Alex |last1=Linley |first2=Susan |last2=Harrington  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology and Work |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR51T4KHf3AC&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533544-6 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also understand the implementation of positive psychology will not necessarily combat any commitment challenges that exist. However, with its implementation employees might become more optimistic and open to new concepts or management practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pambritton.com/what-is-happiness-psychology-and-why-should-smart-entrepreneurs-care/|title=What Is Happiness Psychology and Why Should Smart Entrepreneurs Care?|last=Britton|first=Pam| name-list-format = vanc |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "The Benefits of Frequent Positive Affect: Does Happiness Lead to Success?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; S. Lyubomirsky et al. report: "Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving, including fulfilling and productive work".

Positive psychology, when applied correctly, can provide employees with a greater opportunity to use skills and vary work duties. However, changing work conditions and roles can lead to stress among employees if they are improperly supported by management. This is particularly true for employees who must meet the expectations of organizations with unrealistic goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C &amp; Lopez, J.|year=2002|title= Handbook of Positive Psychology|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.deakin.eblib.com.au/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=271581&amp;userid=WEAuOX57P1tMHeNgDQM4dA%3d%3d&amp;tstamp=1273278299&amp;id=9E207671A9591844A5DE424F74A348322954B1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Tasker (2010) showed less worker autonomy, fewer opportunities for development, less-enriched work roles, and lower levels of supervisor support reflected the effect of industry growth on job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas JC, Tasker TE | year = 2010 | title = Life, liberty, work, and the pursuit of happiness | url = | journal = Psyccritiques | volume = 55 | issue = 51| pages = | doi = 10.1037/a0022089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Can an organization implement positive change? Lewis et al. (2007) developed [[appreciative inquiry]] (AI), which is an integrated, organizational-level methodology for approaching [[organizational development]]. Appreciative inquiry is based on the generation of organizational resourcefulness, which is accomplished by accessing a variety of human psychological processes, such as: positive emotional states, imagination, social cohesion, and the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis S, Passmore J, Cantore S |title=Positive psychology and managing change |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=932–4 |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/positive-psychology-managing-change/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new practice in the workplace is recruiting and developing people based on their strengths (what they love to do, are naturally good at and energises them). Standard Chartered Bank pioneered this approach in the early 2000s. More and more organisations are realising the benefit of recruiting people who are in their element in the job as opposed to simply having the right competencies for the job. Aviva, Morrisons (a large UK supermarket) and Starbucks have all adopted this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engagingminds.co.uk/sbr/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/How-strengths-based-recruitment-transforms-organisations.pdf|title=How Strengths-based Recruitment Transforms Organisations|work=engagingminds.co.uk|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] has extensively researched the merit of undertaking good work at one's job. He suggested young generations (particularly in the United States) are taught to focus on the selfish pursuit of money for its own sake, although having money does not engender happiness, and psychological studies show that there is a strong correlation between the wealthy and experience of intensively negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20060630/study-money-wont-make-you-happy|title=Study: Money Won't Make You Happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's proposed alternatives loosely follow the pleasant/good/meaningful life classifications outlined above; he believes young people should be trained to pursue excellence in their field, as well as engagement (see flow, above) in accordance with their moral belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gardner, TVOpodcast ''Excellence in education'', http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bi?1260050400000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal factors ==
[[File:Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.jpg|thumb|Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.]]

=== Criminology ===

==== Offender rehabilitation ====
Traditional work with offenders has focused on their deficits (e.g., with respect to socialization, and schooling) and other "criminogenic" risk-factors. Rehabilitation more often than not has taken the form of forced treatment or training, ostensibly for the good of the offender, and the community. Arguably, this approach has shortcomings, suggesting a need to make available additional positive options to treatment staff so they can best assist offenders, and so that offenders can better find their way forward. Positive psychology has made recent inroads with the advent of the "Good Lives Model", developed by Tony Ward, Shadd Maruna, and others. With respect to rehabilitation: "Individuals take part ... because they think that such activities might either improve the quality of their life (an intrinsic goal) or at least look good to judges, parole boards and family members (an extrinsic goal)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Tony | last1 = Ward | first2 = Shadd | last2 = Maruna  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rehabilitation|location=London, New York|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive criminology and positive victimology ====
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and victimology, respectively. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

=== Economics ===
{{merge|Happiness_economics|discuss=Talk:Happiness_economics#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}
In [[economics]], the term well-being is used for one or more [[Numerical data|quantitative]] measures intended to assess the [[quality of life]] of a group, for example, in the [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Happiness economics|economics of happiness]]. As with the related [[cognate]] terms '[[wealth]]' and 'welfare', economics sources often contrast the state with its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Economic Literature'' [[JEL classification codes#Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories|Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories]] at JEL: I3 - Welfare and Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], 1776.

=== Political views ===
Psychologists in the happiness community feel politics should promote population happiness. Politics should also consider level of human happiness among future generations, concern itself with life expectancy, and focus on the reduction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brülde B |title=Happiness, Morality, and Politics |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=567–583 |date=October 2010 |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on political affiliation, some studies argue conservatives, on average, are happier than liberals.

== Cultural factors ==
{{main|Culture and positive psychology}}

=== Culture ===
People base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them. Well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them, whether that positively or negatively. Whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that culture's type. According to Diener and Suh,
{{quote|[[Collectivistic]] cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being, whereas those [individualistic] societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal [frame of reference] arising from one’s own happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Suh|first2=Eunkook M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Culture and subjective well-being|date=2003|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-262-54146-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Different views on well-being ===
Various cultures have various perspectives on the nature of positive human functioning. For example, studies on [[aversion to happiness]], or fear of happiness, indicates that some individuals and cultures are averse to the experience of happiness, because they believe happiness may cause bad things to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aversion to Happiness Across Cultures: A Review of Where and Why People are Averse to Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2013|volume=15|issue=3|pages=717–735|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence indicates that there are fundamental differences in the ways well-being is construed in Western and non-Western cultures, including the Islamic and East Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring various cultural perspectives on well-being, Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. For example, whereas Western cultures tend to emphasize the absence of negative emotions and autonomy in defining well-being, Eastern cultures tend to emphasize virtuous or religious activity, self-transcendence, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eunkook M. Suh (University of California) and Shigehiro Oishi (University of Minnesota; now at University of Virginia) examined the differences of happiness on an international level and different cultures' views on what creates well-being and happiness. In a study, of over 6,000 students from 43 nations, to identify mean life satisfaction, on a scale of 1–7, the Chinese ranked lowest at 3.3; and Dutch scored the highest at 5.4. When asked how much subjective well-being was ideal, Chinese ranked lowest at 4.5, and Brazilians highest at 6.2, on a scale of 1–7. The study had three main findings: (1) People living in individualistic, rather than collectivist, societies are happier; (2) Psychological attributes referencing the individual are more relevant to Westerners; (3) Self-evaluating happiness levels depend on different cues, and experiences, from one's culture.&lt;ref name="free-books-online.org"&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Eunkook S |year=2002|title=Subjective Well-Being Across Cultures|accessdate= November 23, 2012|url=http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408081703/http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by Chang E. C. showed that Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans have similar levels of optimism but Asian Americans are far more pessimistic than Caucasian Americans. However, there were no major differences in depression across cultures. On the other hand, pessimism was positively linked to [[problem solving]] behaviors for Asian Americans, but was negatively linked for Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lopez SJ, Snyder CR | title = The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Religiousness and spirituality are closely related but distinct topics. [[Religion]] is any organized, and often [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]], system of cultural practices and beliefs pertaining to the meaning of human existence. It occurs within a traditional context such as a formal religious institution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian, R. F.]], &amp; Park, C. L. (Eds.). (2005). Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirituality]], on the other hand, is a general term applied to the process of finding meaning and a better understanding of one's place in the universe. It is the individual or collective search for that which is sacred or meaningful in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George LK, Larson DB, Koenig HG, McCullough ME | year = 2000 | title = Spirituality and health: What we know, what we need to know | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 102–116 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2000.19.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may therefore be religious but not spiritual, and vice versa.

There have been some studies of how [[Religion and happiness|religion relates to happiness]]. Causal relationships remain unclear, but more religion is seen in happier people. Consistent with PERMA, religion may provide a sense of meaning and connection to something bigger, beyond the self. Religion may also provide community membership and hence relationships. Another component may have to do with ritual.&lt;ref&gt;2009 article in Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and happiness have been studied by a number of researchers, and [[religion]] features many elements addressing the components of happiness, as identified by [[positive psychology]]. Its association with happiness is facilitated in part by the social connections of organized religion,&lt;ref name=Routledge2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Are Religious People Happier Than Non-religious People?

There are a number of mechanisms through which religion may make a person happier, including social contact and support that result from religious pursuits, the mental activity that comes with optimism and volunteering, learned coping strategies that enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and psychological factors such as "reason for being." It may also be that religious people engage in behaviors related to good health, such as less [[substance abuse]], since the use of psychotropic substances is sometimes considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baetz M, Toews J | title = Clinical implications of research on religion, spirituality, and mental health | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

The ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' describes a survey by Feigelman (1992) that examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion, in which it was found that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' (see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 122, Oxford University Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-8133-6719-0}}&lt;br /&gt;Feigelman et al. (1992) examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion. Using pooled data from the General Social Surveys conducted between 1972 and 1990, investigators identified more than 20,000 adults for their study. Subjects of particular interest were “disaffiliates”—those who were affiliated with a religion at age 16 but who were not affiliated at the time of the survey (disaffiliates comprised from 4.4% to 6.0% of respondents per year during the 18 years of surveys). “Actives” were defined as persons who reported a religious affiliation at age 16 and a religious affiliation at the time of the survey (these ranged from 84.7% to 79.5% of respondents per year between 1972 and 1990). Happiness was measured by a single question that assessed general happiness (very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). When disaffiliates (n = 1,420) were compared with actives (n = 21,052), 23.9% of disaffiliates indicated they were “very happy, ” as did 34.2% of actives. When the analysis was stratified by marital status, the likelihood of being very happy was about 25% lower (i.e., 10% difference) for married religious disaffiliates compared with married actives. Multiple regression analysis revealed that religious disaffiliation explained only 2% of the variance in overall happiness, after marital status and other covariates were controlled. Investigators concluded that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness (quality rating 7)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Kosmin &amp; Lachman (1993), also cited in this handbook, indicates that people with no religious affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]''(see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 111, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;br /&gt;Currently, approximately 8% of the U.S. population claim no religious affiliation (Kosmin &amp; Lachman, 1993). People with no affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion. In a sample of 850 medically ill men, Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Pieper, et al. (1992) examined whether religious affiliation predicted depression after demographics, medical status, and a measure of religious coping were controlled. They found that, when relevant covariates were controlled, men who indicated that they had "no religious affiliation" had higher scores on the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (an observer-administered rating scale) than did men who identified themselves as moderate Protestants, Catholics, or nontraditional Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of studies by 147 independent investigators found, "the correlation between religiousness and depressive symptoms was -.096, indicating that greater religiousness is mildly associated with fewer symptoms."&lt;ref name=PsyB129 /&gt;

The [[Legatum Prosperity Index]] reflects the repeated finding of research on the science of happiness that there is a positive link between religious engagement and well-being: people who report that God is very important in their lives are on average more satisfied with their lives, after accounting for their income, age and other individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Legatum Prosperity Index, Summary p. 40.&lt;br&gt; Research suggests that religious people's happiness is less vulnerable to fluctuations in economic and political uncertainty, personal unemployment and income changes. The Prosperity Index identifies similar effects at the country level, with a number of highly religious countries reporting higher levels of happiness than might be expected based on the standard of living alone: this effect is most pronounced in Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican republic, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the [[National Opinion Research Centre]] and the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Organisation]] conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]p156, citing [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' Guilford Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts a lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being.
However, the links between religion and happiness are always very broad in nature, highly reliant on scripture and small sample number. To that extent there is a much larger connection between religion and suffering (Lincoln 1034)."&lt;ref name=PsyB129&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith TB, McCullough ME, Poll J | title = Religiousness and depression: evidence for a main effect and the moderating influence of stressful life events | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 614–36 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of [[hypertension]], depression, and clinical delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]] cites similar results from the''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) {{ISBN|978-0-12-417645-4}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better [[self-actualization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hackney |first1=Charles H. |last2=Sanders |first2=Glenn S. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Religiosity and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, drug/alcohol use/abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreira-Almeida A, Neto FL, Koenig HG | title = Religiousness and mental health: a review | journal = Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–50 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16924349 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there remains strong disagreement among scholars about whether the effects of religious observance, particularly attending church or otherwise belonging to religious groups, is due to the spiritual or the social aspects—i.e. those who attend church or belong to similar religious organizations may well be receiving only the effects of the social connections involved. While these benefits are real enough, they may thus be the same one would gain by joining other, secular groups, clubs, or similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam]] makes this argument in his book (with David Campell) ''American Grace'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiousness has often been found to correlate with positive health attributes. People who are more religious show better emotional well-being and lower rates of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other social problems.&lt;ref name = "Donahue_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donahue MJ, Benson PL | year = 1995 | title = Religion and the well-being of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 145–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01328.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six separate factors are cited as evidence for religion's effect on well-being: religion (1) provides social support, (2) supports healthy lifestyles, (3) promotes personality integration, (4) promotes generativity and altruism, (5) provides unique coping strategies, and (6) provides a sense of meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999) ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality.'' New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious individuals experience emotions that create positive connections among people and allow them to express their values and potential. These four emotions are known as "sacred emotions," which are said to be (1) gratitude and appreciation, (2) forgiveness, (3) compassion and empathy, and (4) humility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Emmons, R. A., (2005). Emotion and Religion. In: Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. Paloutzian, Raymond F. (Ed), Park, Crystal L. (Ed), New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, 2005. pp. 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social interaction is necessarily a part of the religious experience. Religiosity has been identified to correlate positively with prosocial behavior in trauma patients, and prosocial behavior is furthermore associated with well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-03828-001|title = The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior.|last = Frazier|first = Patricia | name-list-format = vanc |date = May 2013|journal = Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has stronger associations with well-being in individuals genetically predisposed towards social sensitivity in environments where religion prioritizes social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and Well-being The Moderating Role of Culture and the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) Gene|url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1394|journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date = 2011-11-01|access-date = 2015-04-12|issn = 0022-0221|pages = 1394–1405|volume = 42|issue = 8|doi = 10.1177/0022022111412526|first = Joni Y.|last = Sasaki|first2 = Heejung S.|last2 = Kim|first3 = Jun|last3 = Xu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to greater resilience against stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1805/14103|title = Religiosity and Spirituality as Resiliency Resources: Moderation, Mediation, or Moderated Mediation?|last1 = Reuter|first1 = Kirby K.|last2 = Bigatti|first2 = Silvia M. | name-list-format = vanc |date = March 2014|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi = 10.1111/jssr.12081| hdl = 1805/14103|pmid = |volume=53 |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher measures of self-actualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff RW, Ladd CE | title = POI correlates of a religious commitment inventory | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–4 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5115658 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197110)27:4&lt;502::AID-JCLP2270270431&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in romantic relationships and parental responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Religion or spirituality has positive impact on romantic/marital relationships, child development, research shows|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141208105320.htm|access-date = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits, while being correlational, may come about as a result of becoming more religiously involved. The benefit of having a secure social group likely plays a key part in religion's positive effects. One form of Christian counseling uses religion through talk therapy and assessments to promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1268720312?accountid=14816|title = Clinical Appraisal of Spirituality: In Search of Rapid Assessment Instruments (RAIs) for Christian Counseling|last = Greggo|first = Stephen P | name-list-format = vanc |date = 2012|journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, people who were not Buddhist, but were exposed to Buddhist concepts, scored higher on measures of outgroup acceptance and prosociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Study finds being exposed to Buddhist concepts reduces prejudice and increases prosociality – The Mirror Post|url = http://www.themirrorpost.com/2015/04/study-finds-being-exposed-to-buddhist.html|website = www.themirrorpost.com|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was found not only in Western countries, but also in places where Buddhism is prevalent, indicating a general association of Buddhism with acceptance. This finding seems to indicate that merely encountering a religious belief system such as Buddhism may allow some of its effects to be transferred to nonbelievers.

However, many disagree that the benefits the religious experience are due to their beliefs, and some find there to be no conclusive psychological benefits of belief at all. For example, the health benefit that the elderly gain from going to church may in fact be the'' ''reason they are able to go to church; the less healthy cannot leave their homes. Meta analysis has found that find studies purporting the beneficial results of religiosity often fail to fully represent data correctly due to a number of issues such as self-report bias, the use of inappropriate comparison groups, and the presence of criterion contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does religious belief promote prosociality?

Religion has power as a cohesive social force, and whether or not it is always beneficial is debated. Irrespective of a group's beliefs, many find that simply belonging to a tight social group reduces anxiety and mental health problems. In addition, there may be a degree of self-selectivity amongst the religious; the behavioral benefits they display may simply be common aspects of those who choose to or are able to practice religion. As a result, whether or not religion can be prescribed scientifically as a means of self-betterment is unclear.

==== Spirituality ====
While religion is often formalised and community-oriented, [[spirituality]] tends to be individually based and not as formalised. In a 2014 study, 320 children, ages 8–12, in both public and private schools, were given a Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire assessing the correlation between spirituality and happiness. Spirituality – and not religious practices (praying, attending church services) – correlated positively with the child's happiness; the more spiritual the child was, the happier the child was. Spirituality accounted for about 3–26% of the variance in happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Mark D. |last2=Coleman |first2=Ben |last3=Wallace |first3=Judi M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spirituality, Religiousness, and Happiness in Children Aged 8–12 Years |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=131–50 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation has been found to lead to high activity in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn has been found to correlate with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|title=A 69-year-old monk who scientists call the 'world's happiest man' says the secret to being happy takes just 15 minutes a day|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-happier-according-to-matthieu-ricard-the-worlds-happiest-man-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people describe themselves as both religious and spiritual, but [[spirituality]] represents just one particular function of religion. Spirituality as related to positive psychology can be defined as "a search for the sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargament KI | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of religion and spirituality?

It simply must be viewed as having spiritual implications which are transcendent of the individual.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C. R., Lopez, Shane|year=2002|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual well-being addresses this human need for [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] and involves social as well as existential well-being. Spiritual [[well-being]] is associated with various positive outcomes such as better physical and psychological well-being, lower anxiety, less depression, [[self-actualization]], positive relationships with parents, higher rates of positive personality traits and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=James M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|location=New York|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have cautioned to differentiate between correlative and causal associations between spirituality and psychology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways?

Reaching the sacred as a personal goal, also called spiritual striving, has been found to correlate highest with well-being compared to other forms of striving.&lt;ref name=jstor27522349/&gt; This type of striving can improve a sense of self and relationships and creates a connection to the transcendent&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt; Additionally, multiple studies have shown that self-reported spirituality is related to lower rates of mortality and depression and higher rates of happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fehring RJ, Miller JF, Shaw C | title = Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer | journal = Oncology Nursing Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–71 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA | title = Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–61 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224176 | pmc = 1380930 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.87.6.957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most research on spirituality examines ways in which spirituality can help in times of crisis. Spirituality has been found to remain constant when experiencing traumatic events and/or life stressors such as accidents, war, sickness, and death of a loved one. When confronted with an obstacle, people might turn to prayer or meditation. [[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] mechanisms involving spirituality include meditative meditation, creating boundaries to preserve the sacred, spiritual purification to return to the righteous path, and spiritual reframing which focuses on maintaining belief. One clinical application of spirituality and positive psychology research is the "psychospiritual intervention," which represents the potential that spirituality has to increase well-being.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002" /&gt; These coping mechanisms that aim to preserve the sacred have been found by researchers to increase well-being and return the individual back to the sacred.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt;

Overall, spirituality is a process that occurs over a lifetime and includes searching, conserving, and redefining what is sacred in an extremely individualized manner. It does not always have a positive effect and in fact has been associated with very negative events and life changes. Research is lacking in spirituality but it is necessary because spirituality can assist in enhancing the experiences of the uncontrollable parts of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Other factors ==

=== Modernity ===
Much research has pointed at the rising rates of depression, leading people to speculate that modernization may be a factor in the growing percentage of depressed people. One study found that women in urban America were much more likely to experience depression than those in rural Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colla J, Buka S, Harrington D, Murphy JM | title = Depression and modernization: a cross-cultural study of women | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16520885 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-006-0032-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p=0.06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hidaka BH | title = Depression as a disease of modernity: explanations for increasing prevalence | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–14 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22244375 | pmc = 3330161 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe it is the increased number of pressures and expectations, increased isolation, increased individualism, and increased inactivity that contribute to higher rates of depression in modern societies.

=== Weather ===
Some evidence suggests sunnier climates do not predict happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas RE, Lawless NM | title = Does life seem better on a sunny day? Examining the association between daily weather conditions and life satisfaction judgments | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 5 | pages = 872–84 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23607534 | pmc = 3695376 | doi = 10.1037/a0032124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study both Californians and Midwesterners expected the former's happiness ratings to be higher due to a sunnier environment. In fact, the Californian and Midwestern happiness ratings did not show a significant difference.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schkade|first1=David A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title=Does Living in California Make People Happy?

That is not to say weather is never a factor for happiness. Perhaps the changing norms of sunlight cause [[seasonal affective disorder]], which undermines level of happiness.

== Additional future research ==
Positive psychology research and practice is currently conducted and developed in various countries throughout the world. To illustrate, in Canada, Charles Hackney of Briercrest College applies positive psychology to the topic of personal growth through martial arts training; [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]], president of the International Network on Personal Meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaning.ca/ |title=International Network on Personal Meaning and Meaning of Life |publisher=Meaning.ca |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing an existential approach to positive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2009 | chapter = Existential positive psychology | veditors = Lopez SJ | title = Encyclopedia of positive psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 361–368 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT, Ivtzan I, Lomas T | year = 2016 | chapter = Good work: A meaning-centred approach | veditors = Oades LG, Steger MF, Fave AD, Passmore J | title = The Wiley Blackwell handbook of the psychology of positivity and strengths-based approaches at work | location = West Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is framed in the [[second wave positive psychology]] (PP 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2011 | title = Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life | url = | journal = Canadian Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1037/a002251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ivtzan I, Lomas T, Hefferon K, Worth P | year = 2015 | title = Second wave positive psychology: Embracing the dark side of life. | location = London, UK | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Mention MAPP program in England, school based on positive psychology in Australia, etc.--&gt;

The research program ‘Understanding Positive Emotions’ at Human Science Lab, [[London]], investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being work as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive emotions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Positive Emotions"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive and behavioral change, although sometimes slight and complex, can produce an 'intense affect'.

Isen (2009) remarked that further progress requires suitable research methods, and appropriate theories on which to base contemporary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isen AM |year=2009|contribution=Positive Affect as a Source of Human Strength| veditors = Snyder CR, Lopez SJ |title=Handbook of positive psychology|pages=179–195|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang (2008) suggested that researchers have a number of paths to pursue regarding the enhancement of emotional intelligence, even though emotional intelligence does not guarantee the development of positive affect; in short, more study is required to track the gradient of positive affect in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Chang KB | year=2008|chapter=Can We Improve Emotional Intelligence|title=Emotional Intelligence; Perspectives on Educational and Positive Psychology|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location= New York|pages=25–45|isbn=9781433101960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
