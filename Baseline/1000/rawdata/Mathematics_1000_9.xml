'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
  | title=Position Available
  | url=http://www.ampl.com/OPENINGS/2011July.html#Product
  | accessdate=2011-07-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator is proprietary software maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However, several online services exist, providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL.&lt;ref name="neos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/|title=NEOS Server for Optimization|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/|title=Try AMPL!|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A free student version with limited functionality and a free full-featured version for academic courses are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|title=AMPL Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526013237/http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL can be used from within [[Microsoft Excel]] via the [[SolverStudio]] Excel add-in.

The AMPL Solver Library (ASL), which allows reading nl files and provides the automatic differentiation, is open-source. It is used in many solvers to implement AMPL connection.

The '''Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS models''', also known as '''ASSA AIDS models''', are a series of [[mathematical model]]s developed to assist the actuarial profession and the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa]] in assessing and addressing the impact of the [[AIDS|HIV and AIDS]] epidemic in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm South Africa HIV AIDS Statistics and Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS Models]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx Actuarial Society of South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104031521/http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models have been developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm AIDS Committee Publications till date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701024530/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|Society]] and the Center for Actuarial Research (CARe) at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm ASSA AIDS Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090613/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

&lt;!---the above disambiguation link does make sense when this article is reached via the REDIRECT from "probability 1"---&gt;
In [[probability theory]], one says that an [[event (probability theory)|event]] happens '''almost surely''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''a.s.''') if it happens with probability one. In other words, the set of possible exceptions may be non-empty, but it has probability zero. The concept is precisely the same as the concept of "[[almost everywhere]]" in [[measure theory]].

In probability experiments on a finite [[sample space]], there is often no difference between ''almost surely'' and ''surely''. However, the distinction becomes important when the [[sample space]] is an [[infinite set]], because an infinite set can have non-empty subsets of probability zero.

Some examples of the use of this concept include the strong and uniform versions of the [[law of large numbers]], and the continuity of the paths of [[Brownian motion]].

The terms '''almost certainly''' (a.c.) and '''almost always''' (a.a.) are also used. '''Almost never''' describes the opposite of ''almost surely'': an event that happens with probability zero happens ''almost never''.&lt;ref name=Gradel&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grädel |first1=Erich |last2=Kolaitis |first2=Phokion G. |last3=Libkin |first3=Leonid | author3-link=Leonid Libkin |last4=Marx |first4=Maarten |last5=Spencer |first5=Joel |last6=Vardi |first6=Moshe Y. |last7=Venema |first7=Yde |last8=Weinstein |first8=Scott |title=Finite Model Theory and Its Applications |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-00428-8 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]]. An [[event (probability theory)|event]] &lt;math&gt;E \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; happens ''almost surely'' if &lt;math&gt;P(E)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; happens almost surely if the probability of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; not occurring is [[0 (number)|zero]]: &lt;math&gt;P(E^C) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, any event &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq \Omega&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;) happens almost surely if &lt;math&gt;E^C&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a [[null set]]: a subset of some &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; such that {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P(N)=0&lt;/math&gt;.}}&lt;ref name="Jacod"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacod|first=Jean|author2=Protter, |year=2004|title=Probability Essentials|publisher=Springer|page=37|isbn=978-3-540-438717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of almost sureness depends on the probability measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If it is necessary to emphasize this dependence, it is customary to say that the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''P''-almost surely, or almost surely (''P'').

==Illustrative examples==
In general, an event can happen "almost surely" even if the probability space in question includes outcomes which do not belong to the event, as is illustrated in the examples below.

===Throwing a dart===
Imagine throwing a dart at a unit square (i.e. a square with area 1) so that the dart always hits exactly one point of the square, and so that each point in the square is equally likely to be hit. 

Now, notice that since the square has area 1, the probability that the dart will hit any particular subregion of the square equals the area of that subregion. For example, the probability that the dart will hit the right half of the square is 0.5, since the right half has area 0.5.

Next, consider the event that "the dart hits a diagonal of the unit square exactly". Since the areas of the diagonals of the square are zero, the probability that the dart lands exactly on a diagonal is zero. So, the dart will '''almost never''' land on a diagonal (i.e. it will '''almost surely''' ''not'' land on a diagonal). Nonetheless the set of points on the diagonals is not empty and a point on a diagonal is no less possible than any other point: the diagonal does contain valid outcomes of the experiment.

===Tossing a coin repeatedly===
Consider the case where a (possibly biased) coin is tossed, corresponding to the probability space &lt;math&gt;(\{H,T\}, 2^{\{H, T\}}, P)&lt;/math&gt;, where the event &lt;math&gt;\{H\}&lt;/math&gt; occurs if heads is flipped, and &lt;math&gt;\{T\}&lt;/math&gt; if tails. For this particular coin, assume the probability of flipping heads is &lt;math&gt;P(H) = p\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; from which it follows that the complement event, flipping tails, has &lt;math&gt;P(T) = 1 - p&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we were to conduct an experiment where the coin is tossed repeatedly, with outcomes &lt;math&gt;\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, and it is assumed each flip's outcome is independent of all the others. That is, they are [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|''i.i.d.'']]. Define the sequence of random variables on the coin toss space, &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X_i(\omega)=\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;. ''i.e.'' each &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; records the outcome of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th flip.

Any infinite sequence of heads and tails is a possible outcome of the experiment.  However, any particular infinite sequence of heads and tails has probability zero of being the exact outcome of the (infinite) experiment.  To see why, note that the [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|''i.i.d.'']] assumption implies that the probability of flipping all heads over &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; flips is simply &lt;math&gt;P(X_i = H, \ i=1,2,\dots,n)=\left(P(X_1 = H)\right)^n = p^n&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;n\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; yields zero, since &lt;math&gt;p\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; by assumption. Note that the result is the same no matter how much we bias the coin towards heads, so long as we constrain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to be greater than 0, and less than 1.

In particular, the event "the sequence contains at least one &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;" happens almost surely (i.e., with probability 1).
However, if instead of an infinite number of flips we stop flipping after some finite time, say a million flips, then the all-heads sequence has non-zero probability. The all-heads sequence has probability &lt;math&gt;p^{1,000,000}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, while the probability of getting at least one tails is &lt;math&gt;1 - p^{1,000,000}&lt;/math&gt; and the event is no longer '''almost sure'''.

==Asymptotically almost surely==
In [[asymptotic analysis]], one says that a property holds '''asymptotically almost surely''' ('''a.a.s.''') if, over a sequence of sets, the probability converges to 1. For instance, a large number is asymptotically almost surely [[composite number|composite]], by the [[prime number theorem]]; and in [[random graph|random graph theory]], the statement "&lt;math&gt;G(n,p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]]" (where [[Erdős–Rényi model|&lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;]] denotes the graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with edge probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) is true a.a.s. when, for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_n &lt; \tfrac{(1+\varepsilon) \ln n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=RandGraph&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Rödl |first2=Vojtech |last3=Rucinski |first3=Andrzej |last4=Tetali |first4=Prasad|author4-link= Prasad V.

In [[number theory]] this is referred to as "[[almost all]]", as in "almost all numbers are composite". Similarly, in graph theory, this is sometimes referred to as "almost surely".&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Joel H. |title=The Strange Logic of Random Graphs |publisher=Springer |date=2001 |series=Algorithms and Combinatorics |volume=22 |isbn=978-3540416548 |chapter=0.

{{Pi box}}
[[Approximation#Mathematics|Approximations]] for the [[mathematical constant]] [[pi]] ({{pi}}) in the [[history of mathematics]] reached an accuracy within 0.04% of the true value before the beginning of the [[Common Era]] ([[Archimedes]]). In [[Chinese mathematics]], this was improved to approximations correct to what corresponds to about seven decimal digits by the 5th century.

Further progress was not made until the 15th century ([[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]]). Early modern mathematicians reached an accuracy of 35 digits by the beginning of the 17th century ([[Ludolph van Ceulen]]), and 126 digits by the 19th century ([[Jurij Vega]]), surpassing the accuracy required for any conceivable application outside of pure mathematics.&lt;!--see point on planck scale vs. size of observable universe in article body--&gt;

The record of manual approximation of {{pi}} is held by [[William Shanks]], who calculated 527 digits correctly in the years preceding 1873. Since the middle of the 20th century, the approximation of {{pi}} has been the task of electronic digital computers; {{as of|November 2016|lc=y}}, the record is 22.4{{nbsp}}trillion digits.&lt;ref name="Yee2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/|title=y-cruncher: A Multi-Threaded Pi Program|first=Alexander J.|last=Yee|date=2016|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For a comprehensive account, see [[chronology of computation of π|Chronology of computation of {{pi}}]].)

==Early history==
The best known approximations to {{pi}} dating to [[1st millennium BC|before the Common Era]] were accurate to two decimal places; this was improved upon in [[Chinese mathematics]] in particular by the mid-first millennium, to an accuracy of seven decimal places. After this, no further progress was made until the late medieval period.

Some Egyptologists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonians were aware that this was an approximation, and one Old Babylonian mathematical tablet excavated near [[Susa]] in 1936 (dated to between the 19th and 17th centuries BCE) gives a better approximation of {{pi}} as {{math|1=25/8=3.125}}, about 0.5 percent below the exact value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

At about the same time, the Egyptian [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (dated to the [[Second Intermediate Period]], c. 1600&amp;nbsp;BCE, although stated to be a copy of an older, [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] text) implies an approximation of {{pi}} as {{frac|256|81}} ≈ 3.16 (accurate to 0.6 percent) by calculating the area of a circle by approximating the circle by an octagon.&lt;ref name=Rossi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Astronomical calculations in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' (c. 6th century BCE) use a fractional approximation of {{math|1= 339/108 ≈ 3.139}}.&lt;ref&gt;Chaitanya, Krishna. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9h35T9PdIoHQrQeO4ZXhBg&amp;id=hDc8AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Satapatha+Brahmana+value+of+pi&amp;q=pi#search_anchor A profile of Indian culture.] Indian Book Company (1975). P. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BCE, [[Archimedes]] proved the sharp inequalities {{frac|223|71}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{frac|22|7}}, by means of regular [[Polygon|96-gons]] (accuracies of 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and 4·10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively).

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]], used the value {{frac|377|120}}, the first known approximation accurate to three decimal places (accuracy 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;http://uzweb.uz.ac.zw/science/maths/zimaths/pi.htm{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Liu Hui]] in 263&amp;nbsp;CE computed {{pi}} to between {{val|3.141024}} and {{val|3.142708}} by inscribing a 96-gon and 192-gon; the average of these two values is {{val|3.141866}} (accuracy 9·10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;).
He also suggested that 3.14 was a good enough approximation for practical purposes. He has also frequently been credited with a later and more accurate result {{math|1=π ≈ 3927/1250 = 3.1416}} (accuracy 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), although some scholars instead believe that this is due to the later (5th-century) Chinese mathematician [[Zu Chongzhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Zu Chongzhi is known to have computed {{pi}} between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, which was correct to seven decimal places. He gave [[Milü|two other approximations of {{pi}}]]: {{math|1=π ≈ 22/7}} and {{math|1=π ≈ 355/113}}. The latter fraction is the best possible rational approximation of {{pi}} using fewer than five decimal digits in the numerator and denominator. Zu Chongzhi's result surpasses the accuracy reached in Hellenistic mathematics, and would remain without improvement for close to a millennium.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[Gupta-era India]] (6th century), mathematician [[Aryabhata]] in his astronomical treatise [[Āryabhaṭīya]] calculated the value of {{pi}} to five significant figures ({{math|1=π ≈ 62832/20000 = 3.1416}}).&lt;ref name="aryabhattapi"&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/8wRiLexg1N2IOXjeK2BKcL/How-Aryabhata-got-the-earths-circumference-right-millenia-a.html How Aryabhata got the earth's circumference right] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115063654/http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/8wRiLexg1N2IOXjeK2BKcL/How-Aryabhata-got-the-earths-circumference-right-millenia-a.html |date=15 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Āryabhaṭīya ({{IAST|gaṇitapāda&amp;nbsp;10}}):

==Middle Ages==
By the 5th century CE, {{pi}} was known to about seven digits in Chinese mathematics, and to about five in Indian mathematics. Further progress was not made for nearly a millennium, until the 14th century, when Indian mathematician and astronomer [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]], founder of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]], discovered the [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] for {{pi}}, now known as the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava–Leibniz series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Functions|author1=George E. Andrews |author2=Richard Askey |first=Ranjan Roy|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-521-78988-5|page=58|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=R.

One of these methods is to obtain a rapidly converging series by transforming the original [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] of {{pi}}. By doing so, he obtained the infinite series

: &lt;math&gt;\pi = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-3)^{-k}}{2k+1} = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-\frac{1}{3})^k}{2k+1} = \sqrt{12}\left(1-{1\over 3\cdot3}+{1\over5\cdot 3^2}-{1\over7\cdot 3^3}+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

{{comparison_pi_infinite_series.svg|300px|two Madhava series (the one with {{radic|12}} in dark blue) and}}

and used the first 21 terms to compute an approximation of {{pi}} correct to 11 decimal places as {{val|3.14159265359}}.

The other method he used was to add a remainder term to the original series of {{pi}}. He used the remainder term

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{n^2 + 1}{4n^3 + 5n}&lt;/math&gt;

in the infinite series expansion of {{frac|{{pi}}|4}} to improve the approximation of {{pi}} to 13 decimal places of accuracy when&amp;nbsp;{{math|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;75.

[[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] (Kāshānī), a [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomer]] and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], correctly computed 2{{pi}} to 9 [[sexagesimal]] digits in 1424.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boris A. Rosenfeld |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Adolf P.

: &lt;math&gt; 2\pi \approx 6.28318530717958648, &lt;/math&gt;

which equates to

: &lt;math&gt; \pi \approx 3.14159265358979324. &lt;/math&gt;

He achieved this level of accuracy by calculating the perimeter of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Mohammad K. | last1=Azarian | title=al-Risāla al-muhītīyya: A Summary | journal=Missouri Journal of Mathematical Sciences | volume=22 | issue=2 | year=2010 | pages=64–85 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.mjms/1312233136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th to 19th centuries==
In the second half of the 16th century, the French mathematician [[François Viète]] discovered an infinite product that converged on {{pi}} known as [[Viète's formula]].

The German-Dutch mathematician [[Ludolph van Ceulen]] (''circa'' 1600) computed the first 35 decimal places of {{pi}} with a 2&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;-gon. He was so proud of this accomplishment that he had them inscribed on his [[tomb stone|tombstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-history/hap-6-pi.pdf Capra, B. Digits of Pi] Retrieved 13th January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cyclometricus'' (1621), [[Willebrord Snellius]] demonstrated that the perimeter of the inscribed polygon converges on the circumference twice as fast as does the perimeter of the corresponding circumscribed polygon. This was proved by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1654. Snellius was able to obtain seven digits of {{pi}} from a [[enneacontahexagon|96-sided polygon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:NTSdP7wNFA8J:www.ijpam.eu/contents/2003-7-2/4/4.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjTAd8gQzDqGaN7fo99joDgBNmLm4PCsT69_vWR13A0nR6yT0T-RZFFSpqN-djir-w4lBOV2Juacul9apQNCW2KMOxf0csRinFDa-1DOSRpxTk83Cg4i8qAxvylfWoLRM04qjE8&amp;sig=AHIEtbSw0AiTGzbt4uLFRLrbOXiXNknJCg Google Docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789, the Slovene mathematician [[Jurij Vega]] calculated the first 140 decimal places for {{pi}}, of which the first 126 were correct&lt;ref name="Sandifer2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Sandifer |year=2007 |title=Jurij baron Vega in njegov čas: Zbornik ob 250-letnici rojstva |page=17 |chapter=Why 140 Digits of Pi Matter |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184631/http://people.wcsu.edu/sandifere/History/Preprints/Talks/Jurij%20Vega/Vega%20math%20script.pdf#page=17 |trans-title=Baron Jurij Vega and His Times: Celebrating 250 Years |publisher=DMFA |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-6137-98-0 |lccn=2008467244 |oclc=448882242 |quote=We should note that Vega's value contains an error in the 127th digit. Vega gives a 4 where there should be an {{bracket|6}}, and all digits after that are incorrect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held the world record for 52 years until 1841, when [[William Rutherford (mathematician)|William Rutherford]] calculated 208 decimal places, of which the first 152 were correct. Vega improved [[John Machin]]'s formula from 1706 and his method is still mentioned today.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The magnitude of such precision (152 decimal places) can be put into context by the fact that the circumference of the largest known object, the observable universe, can be calculated from its diameter (93{{nbsp}}billion [[light-year]]s) to a precision of less than one [[Planck length]] (at {{val|1.6162|e=-35|u=[[meter]]s}}, the shortest unit of length that has real meaning) using {{pi}} expressed to just 62 decimal places.

The English amateur mathematician [[William Shanks]], a man of independent means, spent over 20 years calculating {{pi}} to 707 decimal places. This was accomplished in 1873, with the first 527 places correct. He would calculate new digits all morning and would then spend all afternoon checking his morning's work. This was the longest expansion of {{pi}} until the advent of the electronic digital computer three-quarters of a century later.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==20th and 21st centuries==
{{main|Chronology of computation of π#The age of electronic computers (from 1949 onwards)}}
In 1910, the Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] found several rapidly converging infinite series of {{pi}}, including

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}} &lt;/math&gt;

which computes a further eight decimal places of {{pi}} with each term in the series. His series are now the basis for the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. See also [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].

From the mid-20th century onwards, all calculations of {{pi}} have been done with the help of [[calculators]] or [[computers]].

In 1944, D. F. Ferguson, with the aid of a [[Mechanical calculator|mechanical desk calculator]], found that William Shanks had made a mistake in the 528th decimal place, and that all succeeding digits were incorrect.

In the early years of the computer, an expansion of {{pi}} to {{val|100000}} decimal places&lt;ref name="Shanks &amp; Wrench"/&gt;{{Rp|78}} was computed by Maryland mathematician [[Daniel Shanks]] (no relation to the above-mentioned William Shanks) and his team at the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C. In 1961, Shanks and his team used two different power series for calculating the digits of {{pi}}. For one, it was known that any error would produce a value slightly high, and for the other, it was known that any error would produce a value slightly low. And hence, as long as the two series produced the same digits, there was a very high confidence that they were correct. The first 100,265 digits of {{pi}} were published in 1962.&lt;ref name="Shanks &amp; Wrench"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=D.|last1=Shanks|author1-link=Daniel Shanks|first2=J.

In 1989, the [[Chudnovsky brothers]] computed {{pi}} to over 1 billion decimal places on the [[supercomputer]] [[IBM 3090]] using the following variation of Ramanujan's infinite series of {{pi}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 640320^{3k + 3/2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1999, [[Yasumasa Kanada]] and his team at the [[University of Tokyo]] computed {{pi}} to over 200 billion decimal places on the supercomputer [[HITACHI SR8000/MPP]] (128 nodes) using another variation of Ramanujan's infinite series of {{pi}}. In October 2005, they claimed to have calculated it to 1.24 trillion places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.super-computing.org/pi_current.html|title=Announcement at the Kanada lab web site.|website=Super-computing.org|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records since then have all been accomplished on personal computers using the [[Chudnovsky algorithm]]. In 2009, [[Fabrice Bellard]] computed just under 2.7 trillion digits, and from 2010 onward, all records have been set using Alexander Yee's [[y-cruncher]] software.  {{As of|2016|November}}, the record stands at 22,459,157,718,361 ({{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |title=Digit Statistics of the First 22.4 Trillion Decimal Digits of Pi |eprint=1612.00489 |class=math.NT |date=30 November 2016 |first=Peter |last=Treub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitation on further expansion is primarily storage space for the computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=12.1 Trillion Digits of Pi, And we're out of disk space... |first1=Alexander J. |last1=Yee |first2=Shigeru |last2=Kondo |url=http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-12t/ |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, [[Yasumasa Kanada]] and a team of 9 others used the [[Hitachi SR8000]], a 64-node supercomputer with 1 terabyte of main memory, to calculate {{pi}} to roughly 1.24 trillion digits in around 600 hours.

In August 2009, a Japanese supercomputer called the [[T2K Open Supercomputer]] more than doubled the previous record by calculating {{pi}} to roughly 2.6 trillion digits in approximately 73 hours and 36 minutes.

In December 2009, [[Fabrice Bellard]] used a home computer to compute 2.7 trillion decimal digits of {{pi}}. Calculations were performed in base 2 (binary), then the result was converted to base 10 (decimal). The calculation, conversion, and verification steps took a total of 131 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bellard.org/pi/pi2700e9/|title=Pi Computation Record|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Shigeru Kondo used Alexander Yee's y-cruncher to calculate 5 trillion digits of {{pi}}. This was the world record for any type of calculation, but significantly it was performed on a home computer built by Kondo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/article_743.html McCormick Grad Sets New Pi Record] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928084418/http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/article_743.html |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation was done between 4 May and 3 August, with the primary and secondary verifications taking 64 and 66 hours respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-5t/announce_en.html|title=Pi - 5 Trillion Digits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Sandon Van Ness, going by the pseudonym "houkouonchi" used y-cruncher to calculate 13.3 trillion digits of {{pi}}.&lt;ref name="Yee2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/|title=y-cruncher: A Multi-Threaded Pi Program|first=Alexander J.|last=Yee|date=2018|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Peter Trueb and his sponsors computed on y-cruncher and fully verified 22.4 trillion digits of {{pi}}. The computation took (with three interruptions) 105 days to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/|title=y-cruncher - A Multi-Threaded Pi Program|website=www.numberworld.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical approximations==
Depending on the purpose of a calculation, {{pi}} can be approximated by using fractions for ease of calculation. The most notable such approximations are {{frac|22|7}} ([[relative error]] of about 4·10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) and {{frac|355|113}} (relative error of about 8·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Non-mathematical "definitions" of {{pi}} ==
Of some notability are legal or historical texts purportedly "defining {{pi}}" to have some rational value, such as the "[[Indiana Pi Bill]]" of 1897, which stated "the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four" (which would imply "{{math|1=''π'' = 3.2}}") and a passage in the [[Hebrew Bible]] that implies that {{math|1=''&amp;pi;'' = 3}}.

===Indiana bill===
The so-called "[[Indiana Pi Bill]]" of 1897 has often been characterized as an attempt to "legislate the value of Pi". Rather, the bill dealt with a purported solution to the problem of geometrically "[[squaring the circle]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Indiana's squared circle" by Arthur E. Hallerberg (''Mathematics Magazine'', vol. 50 (1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;136–140)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was nearly passed by the [[Indiana General Assembly]] in the U.S., and has been claimed to imply a number of different values for {{pi}}, although the closest it comes to explicitly asserting one is the wording "the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four", which would make {{math|1=''π'' = 16/5 = 3.2}}, a discrepancy of nearly 2 percent. A mathematics professor who happened to be present the day the bill was brought up for consideration in the Senate, after it had passed in the House, helped to stop the passage of the bill on its second reading, after which the assembly thoroughly ridiculed it before tabling it indefinitely.

===Imputed biblical value===
{{see also|Molten Sea}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of π]] --&gt;

It is sometimes claimed that the [[Hebrew Bible]] implies that "{{pi}} equals three", based on a passage in {{bibleverse|1 Kings|7:23|NKJV|}} and {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|4:2|NKJV|}} giving measurements for the [[Molten Sea|round basin]] located in front of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as having a diameter of 10 [[cubit]]s and a circumference of 30 cubits.

The issue is discussed in the [[Talmud]] and in [[Rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Boaz|last1=Tsaban|first2=David|last2=Garber|date=February 1998|title=On the rabbinical approximation of {{pi}}|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=25|issue=1|pages=75–84|issn=0315-0860|doi=10.1006/hmat.1997.2185|url=http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~tsaban/Pdf/latexpi.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many explanations and comments are these:
*[[Rabbi Nehemiah]] explained this in his ''Mishnat ha-Middot'' (the earliest known [[Hebrew]] text on [[geometry]], ca. 150 CE) by saying that the diameter was measured from the ''outside'' rim while the circumference was measured along the ''inner'' rim. This interpretation implies a brim about 0.225 cubit (or, assuming an 18-inch "cubit", some 4&amp;nbsp;inches), or one and a third "[[handbreadth]]s," thick (cf. {{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:24||NKJV|}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|4:3||NKJV}}).
* [[Maimonides]] states (ca. 1168 CE) that {{pi}} can only be known approximately, so the value 3 was given as accurate enough for religious purposes. This is taken by some&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur Richard Knorr]], The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems, New York: Dover Publications, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; as the earliest assertion that {{pi}} is irrational.
* Another rabbinical explanation{{by whom|date=April 2015}}{{year needed|date=April 2015}} invokes [[gematria]]: In {{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:23||NKJV}} the word translated 'measuring line' appears in the Hebrew text spelled QWH קַוה, but elsewhere the word is most usually spelled QW קַו. The ratio of the numerical values of these Hebrew spellings is {{frac|111|106}}. If the putative value of 3 is multiplied by this ratio, one obtains {{frac|333|106}} = 3.141509433...&amp;nbsp;– giving 5 correct digits, which is within 1/10,000 of the true value of {{pi}}. For this to work, it must be assumed that the measuring line is different for the diameter and circumference.

There is still some debate on this passage in biblical scholarship.{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Development of efficient formulae==
{{Main article|List of formulae involving π}}

===Polygon approximation to a circle===
Archimedes, in his ''Measurement of a Circle'', created the first algorithm for the calculation of {{pi}} based on the idea that the perimeter of any (convex) polygon inscribed in a circle is less than the circumference of the circle, which, in turn, is less than the perimeter of any circumscribed polygon. He started with inscribed and circumscribed regular hexagons, whose perimeters are readily determined. He then shows how to calculate the perimeters of regular polygons of twice as many sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle. This is a recursive procedure which would be described today as follows: Let {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the perimeters of regular polygons of {{math|''k''}} sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle, respectively. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{2n} = \frac{2p_nP_n}{p_n + P_n}, \quad \quad p_{2n} = \sqrt{p_n P_{2n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Archimedes uses this to successively compute {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using these last values he obtains
:&lt;math&gt;3 \frac{10}{71} &lt; \pi &lt; 3 \frac{1}{7}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is not known why Archimedes stopped at a 96-sided polygon; it only takes patience to extend the computations. [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]] reports in his ''Metrica'' (about 60 CE) that Archimedes continued the computation in a now lost book, but then attributes an incorrect value to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|1971|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archimedes uses no trigonometry in this computation and the difficulty in applying the method lies in obtaining good approximations for the square roots that are involved. Trigonometry, in the form of a table of chord lengths in a circle, was probably used by [[Claudius Ptolemaeus|Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria]] to obtain the value of {{pi}} given in the ''Almagest'' (circa 150 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in the approximation of {{pi}} (when the methods are known) were made by increasing the number of sides of the polygons used in the computation. A trigonometric improvement by [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] (1621) obtains better bounds from a pair of bounds gotten from the polygon method. Thus, more accurate results were obtained from polygons with fewer sides.&lt;ref name=EvesSnell&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viète's formula]], published by [[François Viète]] in 1593, was derived by Viète using a closely related polygonal method, but with areas rather than perimeters of polygons whose numbers of sides are powers of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|1971|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last major attempt to compute {{pi}} by this method was carried out by Grienberger in 1630 who calculated 39 decimal places of {{pi}} using Snell's refinement.&lt;ref name=EvesSnell/&gt;

===Machin-like formula===
{{main|Machin-like formula}}
For fast calculations, one may use formulae such as [[John Machin|Machin's]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 4 \arctan\frac{1}{5} - \arctan\frac{1}{239} &lt;/math&gt;
together with the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the function [[arctan]](''x''). This formula is most easily verified using [[polar coordinates]] of [[complex number]]s, producing:

&lt;math&gt;(5+i)^4\cdot(239-i)=2^2 \cdot 13^4(1+i).&lt;/math&gt;

(Note also that {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{mvar|x}},{{mvar|y}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;} = {239, 13&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} is a solution to the [[Pell equation]] {{mvar|x}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−2{{mvar|y}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1.)

Formulae of this kind are known as ''[[Machin-like formula]]e''. &lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;Machin's particular formula was used well into the computer era for calculating record numbers of digits of {{pi}},&lt;ref name="Shanks &amp; Wrench" /&gt; but more recently other similar formulae have been used as well.

For instance, [[Daniel Shanks|Shanks]] and his team used the following Machin-like formula in 1961 to compute the first 100,000 digits of {{pi}}:&lt;ref name="Shanks &amp; Wrench" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 6 \arctan\frac{1}{8} + 2 \arctan\frac{1}{57} + \arctan\frac{1}{239} &lt;/math&gt;

and they used another Machin-like formula,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 12 \arctan\frac{1}{18} + 8 \arctan\frac{1}{57} - 5 \arctan\frac{1}{239}&lt;/math&gt;

as a check.

The record as of December 2002 by Yasumasa Kanada of Tokyo University stood at 1,241,100,000,000 digits. The following Machin-like formulae were used for this:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 12 \arctan\frac{1}{49} + 32 \arctan\frac{1}{57} - 5 \arctan\frac{1}{239} + 12 \arctan\frac{1}{110443}&lt;/math&gt;
K. Takano (1982).
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 44 \arctan\frac{1}{57} + 7 \arctan\frac{1}{239} - 12 \arctan\frac{1}{682} + 24 \arctan\frac{1}{12943}&lt;/math&gt;
F. C. W. Störmer (1896).

===Other classical formulae===
Other formulae that have been used to compute estimates of {{pi}} include:

[[Liu Hui's π algorithm|Liu Hui]] (see also [[Viète's formula]]):
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\pi &amp;\approx 768 \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2+1}}}}}}}}}\\
&amp;\approx 3.141590463236763.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-3)^{-k}}{2k+1} = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-\frac{1}{3})^k}{2k+1} = \sqrt{12}\left({1\over 1\cdot3^0}-{1\over 3\cdot3^1}+{1\over5\cdot 3^2}-{1\over7\cdot 3^3}+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Euler]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{\pi} = 20 \arctan\frac{1}{7} + 8 \arctan\frac{3}{79} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] / Euler Convergence Transformation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiFormulas.html |title=Pi Formulas - from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2016-04-13 |accessdate=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\pi}{2}= 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{k!}{(2k+1)!!}= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \cfrac {2^k k!^2}{(2k + 1)!} =
1+\frac{1}{3}\left(1+\frac{2}{5}\left(1+\frac{3}{7}\left(1+\cdots\right)\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (2k+1)!! denotes the product of the odd integers up to 2k+1.

[[Ramanujan]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[David Chudnovsky (mathematician)|David Chudnovsky]] and [[Gregory Chudnovsky]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 640320^{3k + 3/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Ramanujan's work is the basis for the [[Chudnovsky algorithm]], the fastest algorithms used, as of the turn of the millennium, to calculate {{pi}}.

===Modern algorithms===
Extremely long decimal expansions of {{pi}} are typically computed with iterative formulae like the [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]] and [[Borwein's algorithm]]. The latter, found in 1985 by [[Jonathan Borwein|Jonathan]] and [[Peter Borwein]], converges extremely quickly:

For &lt;math&gt;y_0=\sqrt2-1,\ a_0=6-4\sqrt2&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;y_{k+1}=(1-f(y_k))/(1+f(y_k)) ~,~ a_{k+1} = a_k(1+y_{k+1})^4 - 2^{2k+3} y_{k+1}(1+y_{k+1}+y_{k+1}^2) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(y)=(1-y^4)^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence &lt;math&gt;1/a_k&lt;/math&gt; [[rate of convergence|converges quartically]] to {{pi}}, giving about 100 digits in three steps and over a trillion digits after 20 steps. However, it is known that using an algorithm such as the Chudnovsky algorithm (which converges linearly) is faster than these iterative formulae.

The first one million digits of {{pi}} and {{frac|1|{{pi}}}} are available from [[Project Gutenberg]] (see external links below). A former calculation record (December 2002) by [[Yasumasa Kanada]] of [[Tokyo University]] stood at 1.24 trillion digits, which were computed in September 2002 on a 64-node [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[supercomputer]] with 1 terabyte of main memory, which carries out 2 trillion operations per second, nearly twice as many as the computer used for the previous record (206 billion digits). The following Machin-like formulæ were used for this:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{4} = 12 \arctan\frac{1}{49} + 32 \arctan\frac{1}{57} - 5 \arctan\frac{1}{239} + 12 \arctan\frac{1}{110443}&lt;/math&gt;
:K. Takano (1982).

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{4} = 44 \arctan\frac{1}{57} + 7 \arctan\frac{1}{239} - 12 \arctan\frac{1}{682} + 24 \arctan\frac{1}{12943}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Carl Størmer|F. C. W. Störmer]] (1896)).

These approximations have so many digits that they are no longer of any practical use, except for testing new supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122159-what-can-you-do-with-a-supercomputer|title=What can you do with a supercomputer? - ExtremeTech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Properties like the potential [[normal number|normality]] of [[pi|{{pi}}]] will always depend on the infinite string of digits on the end, not on any finite computation.

===Miscellaneous approximations===
Historically, [[radix|base]] 60 was used for calculations. In this base, {{pi}} can be approximated to eight (decimal) significant figures with the number 3:8:29:44{{sub|60}}, which is

:&lt;math&gt; 3 + \frac{8}{60} + \frac{29}{60^2} + \frac{44}{60^3} = 3.14159\ 259^+&lt;/math&gt;

(The next [[sexagesimal]] digit is 0, causing truncation here to yield a relatively good approximation.)

In addition, the following expressions can be used to estimate {{pi}}:
* accurate to three digits:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{22}{7} = 3.143^+&lt;/math&gt;
* accurate to three digits:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} = 3.146^+&lt;/math&gt;
: [[Karl Popper]] conjectured that [[Plato]] knew this expression, that he believed it to be exactly {{pi}}, and that this is responsible for some of Plato's confidence in the [[omnicompetence]] of mathematical geometry—and Plato's repeated discussion of special [[right triangle]]s that are either [[isosceles]] or halves of [[equilateral]] triangles.
:: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{15} - \sqrt {3} + 1 = 3.140^+&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{63}{25} \times \frac{17 + 15\sqrt{5}}{7 + 15\sqrt{5}} = 3.14159\ 26538^+&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[continued fraction]] representation of {{pi}} can be used to generate successive [[best rational approximation]]s. These approximations are the best possible rational approximations of {{pi}} relative to the size of their denominators. Here is a list of the first thirteen of these:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A002485 |name=Numerators of convergents to Pi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A002486 |name=Denominators of convergents to Pi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Of all of these, &lt;math&gt;\frac{355}{113}&lt;/math&gt; is the only fraction in this sequence that gives more exact digits of {{pi}} (i.e. 7) than the number of digits needed to approximate it (i.e. 6). The accuracy can be improved by using other fractions with larger numerators and denominators, but, for most such fractions, more digits are required in the approximation than correct significant figures achieved in the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qin.laya.com/tech_projects_approxpi.html|title=Fractional Approximations of Pi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summing a circle's area===
[[File:Pi 30K.gif|thumb|right|Numerical approximation of {{pi}}: as points are randomly scattered inside the unit square, some fall within the unit circle. The fraction of points inside the circle approaches {{math|π/4}} as points are added.]]

Pi can be obtained from a circle if its radius and area are known using the relationship:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If a circle with radius ''{{math|r}}'' is drawn with its center at the point (0,&amp;nbsp;0), any point whose distance from the origin is less than ''{{math|r}}'' will fall inside the circle. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] gives the distance from any point ({{math|''x''}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}}) to the center:
:&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematical "graph paper" is formed by imagining a 1×1 square centered around each cell ({{math|''x''}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}}), where {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[integer]]s between −{{math|r}} and {{math|r}}. Squares whose center resides inside or exactly on the border of the circle can then be counted by testing whether, for each cell ({{math|''x''}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}}),
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \le r.&lt;/math&gt;

The total number of cells satisfying that condition thus approximates the area of the circle, which then can be used to calculate an approximation of {{pi}}. Closer approximations can be produced by using larger values of {{math|r}}.

Mathematically, this formula can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{1}{r^2} \sum_{x=-r}^{r} \; \sum_{y=-r}^{r} \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \le r \\
0 &amp; \text{if } \sqrt{x^2+y^2} &gt; r. \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, begin by choosing a value for {{math|r}}. Consider all cells ({{math|''x''}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}}) in which both {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are integers between −{{math|r}} and {{math|r}}. Starting at 0, add 1 for each cell whose distance to the origin (0,0) is less than or equal to ''{{math|r}}''. When finished, divide the sum, representing the area of a circle of radius {{math|r}}, by {{math|r}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to find the approximation of {{pi}}.
For example, if {{math|r}} is 5, then the cells considered are:

Similarly, the more complex approximations of {{pi}} given below involve repeated calculations of some sort, yielding closer and closer approximations with increasing numbers of calculations.

===Continued fractions===
Besides its simple [[continued fraction]] representation [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1,{{nbsp}}...], which displays no discernible pattern, {{pi}} has many [[generalized continued fraction]] representations generated by a simple rule, including these two.
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi= {3 + \cfrac{1^2}{6 + \cfrac{3^2}{6 + \cfrac{5^2}{6 + \ddots\,}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi = \cfrac{4}{1 + \cfrac{1^2}{3 + \cfrac{2^2}{5 + \cfrac{3^2}{7 + \ddots}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Other representations are available at [http://functions.wolfram.com/Constants/Pi/10/ The Wolfram Functions Site].)

===Trigonometry===

====Gregory–Leibniz series====
The [[Leibniz formula for pi|Gregory–Leibniz series]]
: &lt;math&gt;\pi = 4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \cfrac {(-1)^n}{2n+1} = 4\left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} +- \cdots\right) \! = \cfrac{4}{1 + \cfrac{1^2}{2 + \cfrac{3^2}{2 + \cfrac{5^2}{2 + \ddots}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
is the power series for [[arctan]](x) specialized to {{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. It converges too slowly to be of practical interest. However, the power series converges much faster for smaller values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to formulae where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; arises as the sum of small angles with rational tangents, known as [[Machin-like formula]]e.

====Arctangent====
{{further information|Double factorial}}
Knowing that 4 arctan 1 = {{pi}}, the formula can be simplified to get:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi &amp;= 2\left( 1 + \cfrac{1}{3} + \cfrac{1\cdot2}{3\cdot5}
+ \cfrac{1\cdot2\cdot3}{3\cdot5\cdot7} + \cfrac{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4}{3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot9}
+ \cfrac{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5}{3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot9\cdot11} + \cdots\right) \\
&amp;= 2\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \cfrac {n!}{(2n + 1)!!}
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \cfrac {2^{n+1} n!^2} {(2n + 1)!}
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \cfrac {2^{n+1}} {\binom {2n} n (2n + 1)} \\
&amp;= 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{4}{35} + \frac{16}{315} + \frac{16}{693}
+ \frac{32}{3003} + \frac{32}{6435} + \frac{256}{109395} + \frac{256}{230945} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with a convergence such that each additional 10 terms yields at least three more digits.

====Arcsine====
Observing an equilateral triangle and noting that
: &lt;math&gt;\sin\left (\frac{\pi}{6}\right )=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
yields
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi &amp;= 6 \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
= 6 \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3\cdot 2^3} + \frac{1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 2^5}
 + \frac{1\cdot 3\cdot 5}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdot 7\cdot 2^7} + \cdots\! \right) \\
&amp;= \frac {3} {16^0 \cdot 1} + \frac {6} {16^1 \cdot 3} + \frac {18} {16^2 \cdot 5} + \frac {60} {16^3 \cdot 7} + \cdots\!
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {3 \cdot \binom {2n} n} {16^n (2n+1)} \\
&amp;= 3 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{9}{640} + \frac{15}{7168} + \frac{35}{98304}
+ \frac{189}{2883584} + \cfrac{693}{54525952} + \frac{429}{167772160} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
with a convergence such that each additional five terms yields at least three more digits.

===The Salamin–Brent algorithm===
The [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]] or Salamin–Brent algorithm was discovered independently by [[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard Brent]] and [[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Eugene Salamin]] in 1975. This can compute &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; digits in time proportional to &lt;math&gt;N\,\log(N)\,\log(\log(N))&lt;/math&gt;, much faster than the trigonometric formulae.

==Digit extraction methods==
The [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula]] (BBP) for calculating {{pi}} was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe. Using [[Hexadecimal|{{nowrap|base 16}}]] math, the formula can compute any particular digit of {{pi}}—returning the hexadecimal value of the digit—without having to compute the intervening digits (digit extraction).&lt;ref&gt;MathWorld: BBP Formula [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BBPFormula.html Wolfram.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\pi=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{4}{8n+1}-\frac{2}{8n+4}-\frac{1}{8n+5}-\frac{1}{8n+6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
In 1996, Simon Plouffe derived an algorithm to extract the {{math|n}}th decimal digit of {{pi}} (using base{{nbsp}}10 math to extract a base{{nbsp}}10 digit), and which can do so with an improved speed of {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} time. The algorithm requires virtually no memory for the storage of an array or matrix so the one-millionth digit of {{pi}} can be computed using a pocket calculator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0912.0303v1 |last1=Plouffe |first1=Simon |title=On the computation of the n^th decimal digit of various transcendental numbers |class=math.NT |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would be quite tedious and impractical to do so.
: &lt;math&gt;\pi+3=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n2^nn!^2}{(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt;
The calculation speed of Plouffe's formula was improved to {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} by [[Fabrice Bellard]], who derived an alternative formula (albeit only in base{{nbsp}}2 math) for computing {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bellard's Website: [http://bellard.org/pi/pi_n2/pi_n2.html Bellard.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\pi=\frac{1}{2^6}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2^{10n}} \left (-\frac{2^5}{4n+1}-\frac{1}{4n+3}+\frac{2^8}{10n+1}-\frac{2^6}{10n+3}-\frac{2^2}{10n+5}-\frac{2^2}{10n+7}+\frac{1}{10n+9}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

==Efficient methods==
Many other expressions for {{pi}} were developed and published by Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. He worked with mathematician [[Godfrey Harold Hardy]] in England for a number of years.

Extremely long decimal expansions of {{pi}} are typically computed with the [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]] and [[Borwein's algorithm]]; the [[Salamin–Brent algorithm]], which was invented in 1976, has also been used.

In 1997, [[David H. Bailey]], [[Peter Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]] published a paper (Bailey, 1997) on [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula|a new formula]] for {{pi}} as an [[infinite series]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\pi = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{16^k}
\left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This formula permits one to fairly readily compute the ''k''th [[Binary numeral system|binary]] or [[hexadecimal]] digit of {{pi}}, without having to compute the preceding ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 digits. Bailey's website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/|title=David H Bailey|website=crd.LBL.gov|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains the derivation as well as implementations in various [[programming language]]s. The [[PiHex]] project computed 64&amp;nbsp;bits around the [[Names of large numbers|quadrillion]]th bit of {{pi}} (which turns out to be 0).

[[Fabrice Bellard]] further improved on BBP with [[Bellard's formula|his formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pi314.net/eng/bellard.php |title=The world of Pi - Bellard |publisher=Pi314.net |date=2013-04-13 |accessdate=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{1}{2^6} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{{(-1)}^n}{2^{10n}} \left( - \frac{2^5}{4n+1} - \frac{1}{4n+3} + \frac{2^8}{10n+1} - \frac{2^6}{10n+3} - \frac{2^2}{10n+5} - \frac{2^2}{10n+7} + \frac{1}{10n+9} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Other formulae that have been used to compute estimates of {{pi}} include:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\pi}{2}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{k!}{(2k+1)!!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{2^k k!^2}{(2k+1)!} =1+\frac{1}{3}\left(1+\frac{2}{5}\left(1+\frac{3}{7}\left(1+\cdots\right)\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:[[Isaac Newton|Newton]].
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].
This converges extraordinarily rapidly. Ramanujan's work is the basis for the fastest algorithms used, as of the turn of the millennium, to calculate {{pi}}.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 640320^{3k + 3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:[[David Chudnovsky (mathematician)|David Chudnovsky]] and [[Gregory Chudnovsky]].

==Projects==

===Pi Hex===
[[PiHex|Pi Hex]] was a project to compute three specific binary digits of {{pi}} using a distributed network of several hundred computers. In 2000, after two years, the project finished computing the five trillionth (5*10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), the forty trillionth, and the quadrillionth (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) bits. All three of them turned out to be 0.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Software for calculating {{pi}}==
Over the years, several programs have been written for calculating {{pi}} to [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|many digits]] on [[personal computer]]s.

===General purpose===
Most [[computer algebra system]]s can calculate {{pi}} and other common [[mathematical constant]]s to any desired precision.

Functions for calculating {{pi}} are also included in many general [[Library (computing)|libraries]] for [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], for instance [[Class Library for Numbers]] and [[MPFR]].

===Special purpose===
Programs designed for calculating {{pi}} may have better performance than general-purpose mathematical software. They typically implement [[checkpointing]] and efficient [[paging|disk swapping]] to facilitate extremely long-running and memory-expensive computations.
* '''{{math|''y''}}-cruncher''' by Alexander Yee&lt;ref name="Yee2016"/&gt; is the program which Shigeru Kondo used to compute the current [[#21st century – current claimed world record|world record number of digits]]. {{math|''y''}}-cruncher can also be used to calculate other constants and holds world records for several of them.
* '''PiFast''' by Xavier Gourdon was the fastest program for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2003. According to its author, it can compute one million digits in 3.5 seconds on a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Pentium 4]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/PiProgram/timings.html PiFast timings]"&lt;/ref&gt; PiFast can also compute other irrational numbers like ''[[e (mathematical constant)|{{math|''e''}}]]'' and [[square root of 2|{{math|{{radic|2}}}}]]. It can also work at lesser efficiency with very little memory (down to a few tens of megabytes to compute well over a billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) digits). This tool is a popular benchmark in the [[overclocking]] community. PiFast 4.4 is available from [http://members.shaw.ca/francislyster/pi/pi.html Stu's Pi page]. PiFast 4.3 is available from Gourdon's page.
* '''QuickPi''' by Steve Pagliarulo for Windows is faster than PiFast for runs of under 400 million digits. Version 4.5 is available on Stu's Pi Page below. Like PiFast, QuickPi can also compute other irrational numbers like {{math|''e''}}, {{math|{{radic|2}}}}, and [[square root of 3|{{math|{{radic|3}}}}]]. The software may be obtained from the Pi-Hacks Yahoo! forum, or from [http://members.shaw.ca/francislyster/pi/pi.html Stu's Pi page].

[[Image:Blackboard bold.svg|right|thumb|250px|An example of blackboard bold letters]]
'''Blackboard bold''' is a [[typeface]] style that is often used for certain symbols in [[mathematics|mathematical]] texts, in which certain lines of the symbol (usually vertical or near-vertical lines) are doubled. The symbols usually denote [[Set (mathematics)|number sets]]. One way of producing blackboard bold is to double-strike a character with a small offset on a [[typewriter]].&lt;ref name="sci.math-thread"/&gt; Thus they are also referred to as '''double struck'''.

In typography, such a font with characters that are not solid is called an "inline", "shaded" or "tooled" font.

== Origin ==

In some texts these symbols are simply shown in [[bold type]]. Blackboard bold in fact originated from the attempt to write bold letters on [[chalkboard|blackboard]]s in a way that clearly differentiated them from non-bold letters i.e. by using the edge rather than point of the chalk. It then made its way back into print form as a separate style from ordinary bold,&lt;ref name="sci.math-thread"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/55bd03b808263cee/6300d1a3a394ccb9 Google Groups]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly starting with the original 1965 edition of [[Robert Gunning (mathematician)|Gunning]] and Rossi's textbook on complex analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gunning | first1=Robert C. | authorlink1=Robert Gunning (mathematician) | last2=Rossi | first2=Hugo | year=1965 | title=Analytic functions of several complex variables | publisher=Prentice-Hall }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rejection ==

Some mathematicians do not recognize blackboard bold as a separate style from bold. [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] uses double-struck letters when writing bold on the blackboard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xf88g3_jean-pierre-serre-writing-mathemati_tech "Writing Mathematics Badly" video talk (part 3/3)], starting at 7&amp;prime;08&amp;Prime;&lt;/ref&gt; whereas his published works consistently use ordinary bold for the same symbols.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite book | last=Serre | first=Jean-Pierre | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Cohomologie galoisienne | publisher=Springer-Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Knuth]] also prefers boldface to blackboard bold, and consequently did not include blackboard bold in the [[Computer Modern]] fonts he created for  the [[TeX]] mathematical typesetting system.&lt;ref&gt;Krantz, S., ''Handbook of Typography for the Mathematical Sciences'', Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, Florida, 2001, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'' in 1993 (14th edition) advises: "blackboard bold should be confined to the classroom" (13.14) whereas in 2003 (15th edition) it states that "open-faced (blackboard) symbols are reserved for familiar systems of numbers" (14.12).

== Encoding ==

[[TeX]], the standard typesetting system for mathematical texts, does not contain direct support for blackboard bold symbols, but the add-on AMS Fonts package (&lt;code&gt;amsfonts&lt;/code&gt;) by the [[American Mathematical Society]] provides this facility; a blackboard bold '''R''' is written as &lt;code&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;amssymb&lt;/code&gt; package loads &lt;code&gt;amsfonts&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[Unicode]], a few of the more common blackboard bold characters ('''C''', '''H''', '''N''', '''P''', '''Q''', '''R''' and '''Z''') are encoded in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP) in the ''Letterlike Symbols (2100–214F)'' area, named DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C etc. The rest, however, are encoded outside the BMP, from &lt;code&gt;U+1D538&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;U+1D550&lt;/code&gt; (uppercase, excluding those encoded in the BMP), &lt;code&gt;U+1D552&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;U+1D56B&lt;/code&gt; (lowercase) and &lt;code&gt;U+1D7D8&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;U+1D7E1&lt;/code&gt; (digits). Being outside the BMP, these are relatively new and not widely supported.

== Usage&lt;!--'Blackboard bold letters used in mathematics' redirects here--&gt; ==

The following table shows all available Unicode blackboard bold characters.

The symbols are nearly universal in their interpretation, unlike their normally-typeset counterparts, which are used for many different purposes.

The first column shows the letter as typically rendered by the ubiquitous [[LaTeX]] markup system. The second column shows the Unicode code point. The third column shows the symbol itself (which will only display correctly on browsers that support Unicode and have access to a suitable font). The fourth column describes known typical (but not universal) usage in mathematical texts.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Brown measure''' of an operator in a finite [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]] is a probability measure on the complex plane which may be viewed as an analog of the spectral counting measure (based on [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#algebraic multiplicity|algebraic multiplicity]]) of matrices. 

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite factor with the canonical normalized trace &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. For every operator &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, the function

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \mapsto \tau(\log \left|A-\lambda I\right|), \; \lambda \in \mathbb{C},&lt;/math&gt;

is [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] and its [[Laplacian]] in the [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributional]] sense is a probability measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; which is called the Brown measure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

{{dablink|For the canonical map of an algebraic variety into projective space, see [[Canonical bundle#Canonical maps]].}}

In mathematics, a '''canonical map''', also called a '''natural map''', is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects being mapped against each other. In general it is the map which preserves the widest amount of structure, and it tends to be unique. In the rare cases where latitude in choice remains, the map is either conventionally agreed upon to be the most useful for further analysis, or sometimes simply the most elegant or beautiful known.

A closely related notion is a '''structure map''' or '''structure morphism'''; the map that comes with the given structure on the object. They are also sometimes called canonical maps.

A [[canonical isomorphism]] is a canonical map that is also an isomorphism (i.e., invertible).

In some contexts, it is necessary to address an issue of ''choices'' of canonical maps or canonical isomorphisms; see [[prestack#Definition|prestack]] for a typical example.

==Examples==
*If ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G'', then there is a canonical map from ''G'' to the [[quotient group]] ''G/N'' that sends an element ''g'' to the coset that ''g'' belongs to.
*If ''V'' is a [[vector space]], then there is a canonical map from ''V'' to the second [[dual space]] of ''V'' that sends a vector ''v'' to the linear functional ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = λ(''v'').
*If ''f'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] from a commutative ring ''R'' to commutative ring ''S'', then ''S'' can be viewed as an [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] over ''R''. The ring homomorphism ''f'' is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the [[prime spectrum|prime spectra]]: Spec(''S'') →Spec(''R'') is also called the structure map.
*If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] over a topological space ''X'', then the projection map from ''E'' to ''X'' is the structure map.
*In [[topology]], a canonical map is a function ''f'' mapping a set ''X'' → ''X'' (''X'' [[Modulo operation|modulo]] ''R''), where ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]] in ''X'', that takes each ''x'' in ''X'' to the equivalence class ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' modulo ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq4UDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;pg=PA274|title=Handbook of Mathematics|last=Vialar|first=Thierry|date=2016-12-07|publisher=BoD - Books on Demand|isbn=9782955199008|language=en|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vector algebra]] and [[geometric algebra]] are complementary approaches to providing additional algebraic structures on vector spaces, with geometric interpretations, particularly [[vector field]]s in [[multivariable calculus]] and applications in [[mathematical physics]].

Vector algebra is specific to Euclidean 3-space, while geometric algebra uses [[multilinear algebra]] and applies in all dimensions and signatures, notably 3+1 [[spacetime]] as well as 2 dimensions. They are mathematically equivalent in 3 dimensions, where this article is focused, though the approaches differ. Vector algebra is more widely used in elementary multivariable calculus, while geometric algebra is used in more advanced treatments, and is proposed for elementary use as well.

== Basic concepts and operations ==
Geometric algebra (GA) is an extension or completion of vector algebra (VA).{{sfn|Vold|1993|p=1}} The reader is herein assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts and operations of VA and this article will mainly concern itself with operations in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G_{3}&lt;/math&gt; the GA of 3D space (nor is this article intended to be mathematically rigorous). In GA, vectors are not normally written boldface as the meaning is usually clear from the context.

The fundamental difference is that GA provides an additional product of vectors called the "geometric product". Elements of GA are graded [[multivector]]s, scalars are grade 0, the usual vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2 and the highest grade (3 in the 3D case) is traditionally called the pseudoscalar and designated &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The ungeneralized 3D vector form of the geometric product is {{sfn|Gull|Lasenby|Doran|1993|p=6}}:

:&lt;math&gt;ab=a \cdot b + a \wedge b &lt;/math&gt;

that is the sum of the usual dot (inner) product and the outer (exterior) product (this last is closely related to the cross product and will be explained below).

In VA, entities such as [[pseudovector]]s  and [[pseudoscalar]]s need to be bolted on, whereas in GA the equivalent bivector and pseudovector respectively exist naturally as subspaces of the algebra.

For example, applying vector calculus in 2 dimensions, such as to compute torque or curl, requires adding an artificial 3rd dimension and extending the vector field to be constant in that dimension, or alternately considering these to be scalars. The torque or curl is then a normal vector field in this 3rd dimension. By contrast, geometric algebra in 2 dimensions defines these as a pseudoscalar field (a bivector), without requiring a 3rd dimension. Similarly, the [[scalar triple product]] is ad hoc, and can instead be expressed uniformly using the exterior product and the geometric product.

== Translations between formalisms ==

Here are some comparisons between standard &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; vector relations and their corresponding [[exterior product]] and geometric product equivalents.  All the exterior and geometric product equivalents here are good for more than three dimensions, and some also for two.  In two dimensions the cross product is undefined even if what it describes (like torque) is perfectly well defined in a plane without introducing an arbitrary normal vector outside of the space.

Many of these relationships only require the introduction of the exterior product to generalize, but since that may not be familiar to somebody with only a background in vector algebra and calculus, some examples are given.

=== Cross and exterior products ===
[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|The cross product in relation to the exterior product. In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the "parallel" unit bivector.]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \times \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the plane containing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is an oriented representation of the same plane.

We have the pseudoscalar &lt;math&gt;I = e_{1}e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; (right handed orthonormal frame) and so

: &lt;math&gt;e_{1}I = Ie_{1}=  e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; returns a bivector and

: &lt;math&gt;I (e_{2} \wedge e_{3}) = Ie_2e_3 = -e_1&lt;/math&gt; returns a vector perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;e_{2} \wedge e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; plane.

This yields a convenient definition for the [[cross product]] of traditional vector algebra:

:&lt;math&gt;{u}\times{v} = -I({u}\wedge{v})&lt;/math&gt;

(this is antisymmetric). Relevant is the distinction between axial and polar vectors in vector algebra, which is natural in geometric algebra as the distinction between vectors and bivectors (elements of grade two).

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; here is a unit [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space, which establishes a duality between the vectors and the bivectors, and is named so because of the expected property

:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3)^2 
=  e_1 e_2 e_3 e_1 e_2 e_3
= - e_1 e_2 e_1 e_3 e_2 e_3
=  e_1 e_1 e_2 e_3 e_2 e_3
= - e_3 e_2 e_2 e_3
= -1&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; cross product and the exterior product expression above can be confirmed by direct multiplication of &lt;math&gt;-i = - {e_1} {e_2} {e_3}&lt;/math&gt; with a determinant expansion of the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i} \wedge {e_j}
= \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i}  {e_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Cross product#Cross product as an exterior product|Cross product as an exterior product]].  Essentially, the geometric product of a bivector and the [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space provides a method of calculation of the [[Hodge dual]].

=== Norm of a vector ===

Ordinarily:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

Making use of the geometric product and the fact that the exterior product of a vector wedge with itself is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf u \, \mathbf u = {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = {\mathbf u}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u + \mathbf u \wedge \mathbf u = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lagrange identity ===

In three dimensions the product of two vector lengths can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
=
({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 + {\Vert \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding generalization expressed using the geometric product is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 - (\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v})^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from expanding the geometric product of a pair of vectors with its reverse

:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{u} \mathbf{v})(\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}) 
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} + {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}}) ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} - {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}})
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Determinant expansion of cross and wedge products ===

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \times \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \times {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;

Linear algebra texts will often use the determinant for the solution of linear systems by [[Cramer's rule]] or for and matrix inversion.

An alternative treatment is to axiomatically introduce the wedge product, and then demonstrate that this can be used directly to solve linear systems.  This is shown below, and does not require sophisticated math skills to understand.

It is then possible to define determinants as nothing more than the coefficients of the wedge product in terms of "unit ''k''-vectors" (&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j&lt;/math&gt; terms) expansions as above.

:A one-by-one determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^1&lt;/math&gt; 1-vector.
:A two-by-two determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; bivector
:A three-by-three determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; trivector
:...

When linear system solution is introduced via the wedge product, Cramer's rule follows as a side-effect, and there is no need to lead up to the end results with definitions of minors, matrices, matrix invertibility, adjoints, cofactors, Laplace expansions, theorems on determinant multiplication and row column exchanges, and so forth.

=== Matrix Related===

Matrix inversion (Cramer's rule) and determinants can be naturally expressed in terms of the wedge product.

The use of the wedge product in the solution of linear equations can be quite useful for various geometric product calculations.

Traditionally, instead of using the wedge product, Cramer's rule is usually presented as a generic algorithm that can be used to solve linear equations of the form &lt;math&gt; A  x =  b&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently to invert a matrix).  Namely

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{|A|}\operatorname{adj}( A) b .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a useful theoretic result.  For numerical problems row reduction with pivots and other methods are more stable and efficient.

When the wedge product is coupled with the Clifford product and put into a natural geometric context, the fact that the determinants are used in the expression of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^N&lt;/math&gt; parallelogram area and parallelepiped volumes (and higher-dimensional generalizations thereof) also comes as a nice side-effect.

As is also shown below, results such as Cramer's rule also follow directly from the wedge product's selection of non-identical elements.  The end result is then simple enough that it could be derived easily if required instead of having to remember or look up a rule.

Two variables example
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = a x + b y = c .&lt;/math&gt;

Pre- and post-multiplying by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;      (  a x +  b y ) \wedge  b = ( a \wedge  b) x =        c \wedge  b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a \wedge (  a x +  b y )       = ( a \wedge  b) y =  a \wedge  c      &lt;/math&gt;

Provided &lt;math&gt; a \wedge  b \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b} \begin{bmatrix} c \wedge  b \\  a \wedge  c\end{bmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; a,  b \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt; factors of the wedge products

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \begin{vmatrix}u_1 &amp; u_2 \\ v_1 &amp; v_2 \end{vmatrix} {e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

divide out.

Similarly, for three, or ''N'' variables, the same ideas hold

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp;  b &amp; c \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = d &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b \wedge  c}
\begin{bmatrix}
 d \wedge  b \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  d \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  b \wedge  d
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, for the three variable three equation case this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2 \wedge {e}_3&lt;/math&gt; factors of all the wedge products divide out, leaving the familiar determinants.

A numeric example with three equations and two unknowns:
In case there are more equations than variables and the equations have a solution, then each of the k-vector quotients will be scalars.

To illustrate here is the solution of a simple example with three equations and two unknowns.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
x + 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
x = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and a left wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that both of these equations have the same factor, so
one can compute this only once (if this was zero it would
indicate the system of equations has no solution).

Collection of results for
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; yields a Cramer's rule-like form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 1)}
\begin{bmatrix}
(1, 1, 2) \wedge (1, 1, 1) \\
(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 2)
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing &lt;math&gt;{e} _i \wedge {e} _j = {e} _{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, we have the end result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{{e}_{13} + {e}_{23}}
\begin{bmatrix}
{-{e}_{13} - {e}_{23}} \\
{2{e}_{13} +2{e}_{23}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equation of a plane ===
For the plane of all points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; through the plane passing through three independent points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the normal form of the equation is

:&lt;math&gt;(({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \times ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0)) \cdot ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent wedge product equation is
:&lt;math&gt;({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Projection and rejection ===

Using the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] a single vector can be decomposed into two components with respect to a reference vector, namely the projection onto a unit vector in a reference direction, and the difference between the vector and that projection.

With, &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u} =  u / {\Vert  u \Vert}&lt;/math&gt;, the projection of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Proj}_{{\hat{u}}}\,{v} =  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v)&lt;/math&gt;

Orthogonal to that vector is the difference, designated the rejection,

:&lt;math&gt;  v -  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) = \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2} ( {\Vert  u \Vert}^2  v -  u ( u \cdot  v))&lt;/math&gt;

The rejection can be expressed as a single geometric algebraic product in a few different ways

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{  u }{{ u}^2} (  u  v -  u \cdot  v)
= \frac{1}{ u} (  u \wedge  v )
=  \hat{u} (  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
= (  v \wedge  \hat{u} )  \hat{u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The similarity in form between the projection and the rejection is notable. The sum of these recovers the original vector

:&lt;math&gt; v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) + \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \wedge v ) &lt;/math&gt;

Here the projection is in its customary vector form.  An alternate formulation is possible that puts the projection in a form that differs from the usual vector formulation

:&lt;math&gt;  v
=  \frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \cdot  v) + \frac{1}{ u} (  {u} \wedge  v )
=  ( {v} \cdot  u) \frac{1}{ u}  + (  v \wedge  u ) \frac{1}{ u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Working backwards from the end result, it can be observed that this orthogonal decomposition result can in fact follow more directly from the definition of the geometric product itself.

:&lt;math&gt; v =  \hat{u} \hat{u} v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v +  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
&lt;/math&gt;

With this approach, the original geometrical consideration is not necessarily obvious, but it is a much quicker way to get at the same algebraic result.

However, the hint that one can work backwards, coupled with the knowledge that the wedge product can be used to solve sets of linear equations (see: [http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/bookpdf/TheExteriorProduct.pdf] ), the problem of orthogonal decomposition can be posed directly,

Let &lt;math&gt; v = a  u +  x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  To discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, take the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge (a  u +  x) =  u \wedge  x&lt;/math&gt;

Here the geometric product can be employed

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge  x =  u  x -  u \cdot  x =  u  x&lt;/math&gt;

Because the geometric product is invertible, this can be solved for ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{u}( u \wedge v ) .&lt;/math&gt;

The same techniques can be applied to similar problems, such as calculation of the component of a vector in a plane and perpendicular to the plane.

For three dimensions the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to an arbitrary non-zero unit vector, can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + \hat{\mathbf u} \times (\mathbf v \times \hat{\mathbf u}) .&lt;/math&gt;

For the general case the same result can be written in terms of the dot and wedge product and the geometric product of that and the unit vector

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \hat{\mathbf u}) \hat{\mathbf u}. &lt;/math&gt;

It's also worthwhile to point out that this result can also be expressed using right or left vector division as defined by the geometric product:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf u)\frac{1}{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \mathbf u) \frac{1}{\mathbf u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v) + \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v) .&lt;/math&gt;

Like vector projection and rejection, higher-dimensional analogs of that calculation are also possible using the geometric product.

As an example, one can calculate the component of a vector perpendicular to a plane and the projection of that vector onto the plane.

Let &lt;math&gt; w = a u + b v + x &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x =  v \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  As above, to discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; w&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;, take the wedge product

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = (a u + b v + x) \wedge u \wedge v = x \wedge u \wedge v .&lt;/math&gt;

Having done this calculation with a vector projection, one can guess that this quantity equals &lt;math&gt; x ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt;. One can also guess there is a vector and bivector dot product like quantity such that the allows the calculation of the component of a vector that is in the "direction of a plane".  Both of these guesses are correct, and validating these facts is worthwhile. However, skipping ahead slightly, this to-be-proven fact allows for a nice closed form solution of the vector component outside of the plane:

:&lt;math&gt; x
= ( w \wedge u \wedge v)\frac{1}{ u \wedge v}
= \frac{1}{ u \wedge v}( u \wedge v \wedge w).
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the similarities between this planar rejection result and the vector rejection result. To calculate the component of a vector outside of a plane we take the volume spanned by three vectors (trivector) and "divide out" the plane.

Independent of any use of the geometric product it can be shown that this rejection in terms of the standard basis is

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ { e}_i &amp; { e}_j &amp; { e}_k \\ \end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;(A_{u,v})^2
= \sum_{i&lt;j} \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
= -( u \wedge  v)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

The (squared) magnitude of &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;{\Vert  x \Vert}^2 =
 x \cdot  w =
\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the (squared) volume of the parallelopiped (base area times perpendicular height) is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note the similarity in form to the ''w'', ''u'', ''v'' trivector itself

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} {e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k ,&lt;/math&gt;

which, if you take the set of &lt;math&gt;{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k&lt;/math&gt; as a basis for the trivector space, suggests this is the natural way to define the length of a trivector.  Loosely speaking the length of a vector is a length, length of a bivector is area, and the length of a trivector is volume.

If a vector is factored directly into projective and rejective terms using the geometric product &lt;math&gt; v = \frac{1}{u}( u \cdot v +  u \wedge v)&lt;/math&gt;, then it is not necessarily obvious that the rejection term, a product of vector and bivector is even a vector.  Expansion of the vector bivector product in terms of the standard basis vectors has the following form

:Let &lt;math&gt;
 r
= \frac{1}{ u} ( u \wedge  v )
= \frac{ u}{ u^2} (  u \wedge  v ) 
= \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2}  u (  u \wedge  v ) 
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
 r = \frac{1}{{\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\  e_i &amp;  e_j\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(a result that can be shown more easily straight from &lt;math&gt; r = v - \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot v)&lt;/math&gt;).

The rejective term is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\ u_i &amp; u_j\end{vmatrix} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; r \cdot u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert r \Vert}^2 =  r \cdot  v = \frac{1}{{\Vert{u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

So, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert  r \Vert}^2 {\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also noteworthy that the bivector can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix} e_i \wedge  e_j } .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus is it natural, if one considers each term &lt;math&gt; e_i \wedge  e_j&lt;/math&gt; as a basis vector of the bivector space, to define the (squared) "length" of that bivector as the (squared) area.

Going back to the geometric product expression for the length of the rejection &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u} ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt; we see that the length of the quotient, a vector, is in this case is the "length" of the bivector divided by the length of the divisor.

This may not be a general result for the length of the product of two '''''k''-vectors''', however it is a result that may help build some intuition about the significance of the algebraic operations.  Namely,

:When a vector is divided out of the plane (parallelogram span) formed from it and another vector, what remains is the perpendicular component of the remaining vector, and its length is the planar area divided by the length of the vector that was divided out.

=== Area of the parallelogram defined by u and v ===

If A is the area of the parallelogram defined by '''u''' and '''v''', then 
:&lt;math&gt; A^2 = {\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;A^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this squared bivector is a geometric multiplication; this computation can alternatively be stated as the [[Gram determinant]] of the two vectors.

=== Angle between two vectors ===

:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = \frac{{\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2}{{\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf v \Vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = -\frac{(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2}{{ \mathbf u }^2 { \mathbf v }^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Volume of the parallelopiped formed by three vectors ===
In vector algebra, the volume of a parallelopiped is given by the square root of the squared norm of the [[scalar triple product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;V^2 = {\Vert (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) \cdot \mathbf w \Vert}^2
= {\begin{vmatrix}
u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \\ 
v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3 \\ 
w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; w_3 \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v \wedge \mathbf w)^2
= -\left(\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf e}_i \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_j \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_k 
\right)^2

= \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

====Product of a vector and a bivector====
In order to justify the normal to a plane result above, a general examination of the product of a vector and bivector is required.  Namely,

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v )
= \sum_{i,j&lt;k}w_i {e}_i {\begin{vmatrix}u_j &amp; u_k \\ v_j &amp; v_k \\ \end{vmatrix}} {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

This has two parts, the vector part where &lt;math&gt;i=j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i=k&lt;/math&gt;, and the trivector parts where no indexes equal.  After some index summation trickery, and grouping terms and so forth, this is

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) = 
\sum_{i&lt;j}(w_i { e}_j 
- w_j {e}_i )
{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j \\v_i &amp; v_j \\\end{vmatrix}}
+
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} 
{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

The trivector term is &lt;math&gt; w \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;.  Expansion of &lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v) w&lt;/math&gt; yields the same trivector term (it is the completely symmetric part), and the vector term is negated.  Like the geometric product of two vectors, this geometric product can be grouped into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, one of which is a pure k-vector.  In analogy the antisymmetric part of this product can be called a generalized dot product, and is roughly speaking the dot product of a "plane" (bivector), and a vector.

The properties of this generalized dot product remain to be explored, but first here is a summary of the notation

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) =  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v)  w = -  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v  ) + ( u \wedge v ) w) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \cdot ( u \wedge v) = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v ) - ( u \wedge v ) w)
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; w =  x + y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x = a u + b  v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y \cdot u = y \cdot v = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressing &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;, products in terms of these components is

:&lt;math&gt;  w ( u \wedge v ) =  x ( u \wedge v ) +  y ( u \wedge v ) =  x \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;

With the conditions and definitions above, and some manipulation, it can be shown that the term &lt;math&gt; y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) =  0&lt;/math&gt;, which then justifies the previous solution of the normal to a plane problem.  Since the vector term of the vector bivector product the name dot product is zero
when the vector is perpendicular to the plane (bivector), and this vector, bivector "dot product" selects only the components that are in the plane, so in analogy to the vector-vector dot product this name itself is justified by more than the fact this is the non-wedge product term of the geometric vector-bivector product.

=== Derivative of a unit vector ===

It can be shown that a unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\left(\mathbf r \times \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \mathbf r
= \left(\hat{\mathbf r} \times \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}} \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \hat{\mathbf r}
&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent geometric product generalization is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\mathbf r \left(\mathbf r \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
= \frac{1}{{ \mathbf r }}\left(\hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus this derivative is the component of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, this is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; minus the projection of that vector onto &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt;.

This intuitively makes sense (but a picture would help) since a unit vector is constrained to circular motion, and any change to a unit vector due to a change in its generating vector has to be in the direction of the rejection of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  That rejection has to be scaled by 1/|r| to get the final result.

When the objective isn't comparing to the cross product, it's also notable that this unit vector derivative can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
{{ \mathbf r }} \frac{d \hat{\mathbf r}}{dt}
= \hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''European Congress of Mathematics''' ('''ECM''') is an international congress of the [[mathematics]] community, held every four years.  Its objectives are "to present various new aspects of pure and applied mathematics to a wide audience, to be a forum for discussion of the relationship between mathematics and society in Europe, and to enhance cooperation among mathematicians from all European countries."

The Congress is held under the auspices of the [[European Mathematical Society]] (EMS), and was one of its earliest initiatives. The [[European_Mathematical_Society#Prizes|EMS Prizes]] are awarded at the beginning of the Congress.

== List of congresses ==

* 1992 &amp;ndash; [[Paris]]
* 1996 &amp;ndash; [[Budapest]]
* 2000 &amp;ndash; [[Barcelona]]
* 2004 &amp;ndash; [[Stockholm]]
* 2008 &amp;ndash; [[Amsterdam]]
* 2012 &amp;ndash; [[Kraków]]
* 2016 &amp;ndash; [[Berlin]]

The 8th European Congress of Mathematics will be held in [[Slovenia]] in 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">A '''power quantity''' is a power or a quantity directly proportional to [[Power (physics)|power]], e.g., [[energy density]], [[acoustic intensity]], and [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ainslie |first=Michael A. |url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-Century-of-Sonar.pdf |title=A Century of Sonar: Planetary Oceanography, Underwater Noise Monitoring, and the Terminology of Underwater Sound |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy quantities may also be labelled as power quantities in this context.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000:1-2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''root-power quantity''' is a quantity such as [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], [[sound pressure]], [[electric field strength]], [[speed]], or [[charge density]], the square of which, in linear systems, is proportional to power.&lt;ref name=Hearing&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian C.J. Moore |title=Hearing |date=1995 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-053386-5 |page=11 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OywDx9pxCMYC |page=11 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''root-power quantity'' was introduced in the {{section link|ISO 80000-1|Annex C}}; it replaces and deprecates the term '''field quantity'''.

It is essential to know which category a measurement belongs to when using [[decibel]]s (dB) for comparing the [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]s of such quantities.  A change of one bel in the level corresponds to a 10× change in ''power'', so when comparing power quantities ''x'' and ''y'', the difference is defined to be 10×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') decibel.  With root-power quantities, however the difference is defined as 20×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') dB.&lt;ref name=Hearing/&gt;  In linear systems, these definitions allow the distinction between root-power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying changes as levels: an amplifier can be described as having "3&amp;nbsp;dB" of gain without needing to specify whether voltage or power are being compared; for a given linear load (e.g. an {{val|8|ul=Ω}} speaker), such an increase will result in a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in both the [[sound pressure level]] and the [[sound power level]] at a given location near the speaker.  Conversely, when ratios cannot be identified as either power or root-power quantities, the units [[neper]] (Np) and [[decibel]] (dB) cannot be sensibly used.

In the analysis of signals and systems using sinusoids, field quantities and root-power quantities may be [[complex number|complex]]-valued.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006 §&amp;nbsp;0.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60027-3:2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Root-power quantity" vs. "field quantity"==
In justifying the deprecation of the term "field quantity" and instead using "root-power quantity" in the context of levels, ISO&amp;nbsp;80000 draws attention to the conflicting use of the former term to mean a quantity that depends on the position,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt; which in physics is called a ''[[Field (physics)|field]]''.  Such a field is often called a ''field quantity'' in the literature, but is called a ''field'' here for clarity.  Several types of field (such as the [[electromagnetic field]]) meet the definition of a root-power quantity, whereas others (such as the [[Poynting vector]] and [[temperature]]) do not.  Conversely, not every root-power quantity is a field (such as the voltage on a [[loudspeaker]]).

'''''History of the Theory of Numbers''''' is a three-volume work by [[L. E. Dickson]]  summarizing work in [[number theory]] up to about 1920. The style is unusual in that Dickson mostly just lists results by various authors, with little further discussion. The central topic of [[quadratic reciprocity]] and higher [[reciprocity law]]s is barely mentioned; this was apparently going to be the topic of a fourth volume that was never written {{harv|Fenster|1999}}.

==Volumes==
* Volume 1 - [[Divisibility]] and [[Primality]] - 486 pages
* Volume 2 - [[Diophantine equation|Diophantine Analysis]] - 803 pages
* Volume 3 - [[Quadratic form|Quadratic]] and Higher Forms - 313 pages

This page gives some very general background to the mathematical idea of [[topos]]. This is an aspect of [[category theory]], and has a reputation for being abstruse. The level of abstraction involved cannot be reduced beyond a certain point; but on the other hand context can be given. This is partly in terms of historical development, but also to some extent an explanation of differing attitudes to category theory. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In the school of Grothendieck==
During the latter part of the 1950s, the foundations of [[algebraic geometry]] were being rewritten; and it is here that the origins of the '''topos''' concept are to be found. At that time the [[Weil conjectures]] were an outstanding motivation to research. As we now know, the route towards their proof, and other advances, lay in the construction of [[étale cohomology]].

With the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that algebraic geometry had been wrestling with two problems for a long time. The first was to do with its '''''points''''': back in the days of [[projective geometry]] it was clear that the absence of 'enough' points on an [[algebraic variety]] was a barrier to having a good geometric theory (in which it was somewhat like a [[Compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]). There was also the difficulty, that was clear as soon as [[topology]] took form in the first half of the twentieth century, that the topology of algebraic varieties had 'too few' open sets. 

The question of points was close to resolution by 1950; [[Alexander Grothendieck]] took a sweeping step (invoking the [[Yoneda lemma]]) that disposed of it &amp;mdash; naturally at a cost, that every variety or more general ''[[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]'' should become a [[functor]]. It wasn't possible to ''add'' open sets, though. The way forward was otherwise.

The topos definition first appeared somewhat obliquely, in or about 1960. General problems of so-called '[[descent (category theory)|descent]]' in algebraic geometry were considered, at the same period when the [[fundamental group]] was generalised to the algebraic geometry setting (as a [[pro-finite group]]). In the light of later work (c. 1970), 'descent' is part of the theory of [[comonad]]s; here we can see one way in which the Grothendieck school bifurcates in its approach from the 'pure' category theorists, a theme that is important for the understanding of how the topos concept was later treated.

There was perhaps a more direct route available: the [[abelian category]] concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on [[homological algebra]], to unify categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups, and of [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. An abelian category is supposed to be closed under certain category-theoretic operations &amp;mdash; by using this kind of definition one can focus entirely on [[structure (category theory)|structure]], saying nothing at all about the nature of the objects involved. This type of definition can be traced back, in one line, to the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] concept of the 1930s. It was a possible question to ask, around 1957, for a purely category-theoretic characterisation of categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of ''sets'', the case of sheaves of abelian groups having been subsumed by Grothendieck's work (the [[Tohoku paper|''Tohoku'' paper]]).

Such a definition of a topos was eventually given five years later, around 1962, by Grothendieck and [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]] (see Verdier's Bourbaki seminar ''Analysis Situs''). The characterisation was by means of categories 'with enough [[colimit]]s', and applied to what is now called a [[Grothendieck topos]]. The theory was rounded out by establishing that a Grothendieck topos was a category of sheaves, where now the word ''sheaf'' had acquired an extended meaning, since it involved a [[Grothendieck topology]].

The idea of a Grothendieck topology (also known as a ''site'') has been characterised by [[John Tate]] as a bold pun on the two senses of [[Riemann surface]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Technically speaking it enabled the construction of the sought-after étale cohomology (as well as other refined theories such as [[flat cohomology]] and [[crystalline cohomology]]). At this point &amp;mdash; about 1964 &amp;mdash; the developments powered by algebraic geometry had largely run their course. The 'open set' discussion had effectively been summed up in the conclusion that varieties had a rich enough ''site'' of open sets in [[Ramification (mathematics)|unramified]] covers of their (ordinary) [[Zariski topology|Zariski-open sets]].

==From pure category theory to categorical logic==
{{See|categorical logic}}

The current definition of [[topos]] goes back to [[William Lawvere]] and Myles Tierney. While the timing follows closely on from that described above, as a matter of history, the attitude is different, and the definition is more inclusive. That is, there are examples of '''toposes''' that are not '''Grothendieck topos'''. What is more, these may be of interest for a number of logical disciplines.

Lawvere and Tierney's definition picks out the central role in topos theory of the '''[[sub-object classifier]]'''. In the usual category of sets, this is the two-element set of Boolean [[truth-value]]s, '''true''' and '''false'''. It is almost tautologous to say that the subsets of a given set ''X'' are ''the same as'' (just as good as) the functions on ''X'' to any such given two-element set: fix the 'first' element and make a subset ''Y'' correspond to the function sending ''Y'' there and its complement in ''X'' to the other element.

Now sub-object classifiers can be found in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory. Still tautologously, though certainly more abstractly, for a [[topological space]] ''X'' there is a direct description of a sheaf on ''X'' that plays the role with respect to all sheaves of sets on ''X''. Its set of sections over an open set ''U'' of ''X'' is just the set of open subsets of ''U''. The [[sheaf (mathematics)|space associated with a sheaf]], for it, is more difficult to describe.

Lawvere and Tierney therefore formulated '''axioms for a topos''' that assumed a sub-object classifier, and some limit conditions (to make a [[cartesian-closed category]], at least). For a while this notion of topos was called 'elementary topos'.

Once the idea of a connection with logic was formulated, there were several developments 'testing' the new theory:

* models of set theory corresponding to proofs of the independence of the [[axiom of choice]] and [[continuum hypothesis]] by Cohen's method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]].
* recognition of the connection with [[Kripke semantics]], the [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[existential quantifier]] and [[intuitionistic type theory]].
* combining these, discussion of the [[intuitionistic theory of real numbers]], by sheaf models.

==Position of topos theory==
There was some irony that in the pushing through of [[David Hilbert]]'s long-range programme a natural home for [[intuitionistic logic]]'s central ideas was found: Hilbert had detested the school of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. Existence as 'local' existence in the sheaf-theoretic sense, now going by the name of [[Kripke–Joyal semantics]], is a good match. On the other hand Brouwer's long efforts on 'species', as he called the intuitionistic theory of reals, are presumably in some way subsumed and deprived of status beyond the historical. There is a theory of the real numbers in each topos, and so no one master intuitionist theory.

The later work on [[étale cohomology]] has tended to suggest that the full, general topos theory isn't required. On the other hand, other sites are used, and the Grothendieck topos has taken its place within homological algebra.

The Lawvere programme was to write higher-order logic in terms of category theory. That this can be done cleanly is shown by the book treatment by [[Joachim Lambek]] and [[P. J. Scott]]. What results is essentially an intuitionistic (i.e. [[constructive logic]]) theory, its content being clarified by the existence of a ''free topos''. That is a set theory, in a broad sense, but also something belonging to the realm of pure [[syntax]]. The structure on its sub-object classifier is that of a [[Heyting algebra]]. To get a more classical set theory one can look at toposes in which it is moreover a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], or specialising even further, at those with just two truth-values.  In that book, the talk is about [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]; but in fact this can be read as foundational [[computer science]] (which is not mentioned). If one wants to discuss set-theoretic operations, such as the formation of the image (range) of a function, a topos is guaranteed to be able to express this, entirely constructively.

It also produced a more accessible spin-off in [[pointless topology]], where the ''locale'' concept isolates some of more accessible insights found by treating ''topos'' as a significant development of ''topological space''. The slogan is 'points come later': this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone's ''Stone Spaces'', which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science 'a treatise on [[extensionality]]'. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient - it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped [[lambda calculus]] have been met in [[denotational semantics]]. Topos theory has long looked like a possible 'master theory' in this area.

==Summary==
The ''topos'' concept arose in algebraic geometry, as a consequence of combining the concept of ''sheaf'' and ''closure under categorical operations''. It plays a certain definite role in cohomology theories.

The subsequent developments associated with logic are more interdisciplinary. They include examples drawing on [[homotopy theory]] ([[classifying topos]]es). They involve links between category theory and mathematical logic, and also (as a high-level, organisational discussion) between category theory and theoretical computer science based on [[type theory]]. Granted the general view of [[Saunders Mac Lane]] about ''ubiquity'' of concepts, this gives them a definite status. A 'killer application' is [[étale cohomology]].

{{Merge to|Commutative algebra#History|date=November 2017}}
In [[mathematics]], '''ideal theory''' is the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[commutative ring]]s; and is the precursor name for the contemporary subject of [[commutative algebra]]. The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] in [[algebraic geometry]], and the [[ideal class group]] in [[algebraic number theory]], of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] text on [[abstract algebra]] from around 1930.

The ideal theory in question had been based on [[elimination theory]], but in line with [[David Hilbert]]'s taste moved away from [[algorithm]]ic methods. [[Gröbner basis]] theory has now reversed the trend, for [[computer algebra]].

The importance of the ideal in general of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], more general than an ''ideal'', probably led to the perception that ''ideal theory'' was too narrow a description. [[Valuation theory]], too, was an important technical extension, and was used by [[Helmut Hasse]] and [[Oscar Zariski]].  [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] used ''commutative algebra''; sometimes ''local algebra'' is applied to the theory of [[local ring]]s. [[D. G. Northcott]]'s 1953 [[Cambridge Tract]] ''Ideal Theory'' (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8026">In [[mathematics]], the researcher [[Sophus Lie]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː}} {{respell|LEE|'}}) initiated lines of study involving integration of [[differential equation]]s, [[transformation group]]s, and [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] of [[sphere]]s that have come to be called '''Lie theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;"Lie’s lasting achievements are the great theories he brought into existence. However, these theories – transformation groups, integration of differential equations, the geometry of contact – did not arise in a vacuum. They were preceded by particular results of a more limited scope, which pointed the way to more general theories that followed. The line-sphere correspondence is surely an example of this phenomenon: It so clearly sets the stage for Lie’s subsequent work on contact transformations and symmetry groups." R. Milson (2000) "An Overview of Lie’s line-sphere correspondence", pp 1–10 of ''The Geometric Study of Differential Equations'', J.A. Leslie &amp; T.P. Robart editors, [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|0-8218-2964-5}} , quotation pp 8,9&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the latter subject is [[Lie sphere geometry]]. This article addresses his approach to transformation groups, which is one of the [[areas of mathematics]], and was worked out by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Élie Cartan]].

The foundation of Lie theory is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] relating [[Lie algebra]]s to [[Lie group]]s which is called the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]]. The subject is part of [[differential geometry]] since Lie groups are [[differentiable manifold]]s. Lie groups evolve out of the identity (1) and the [[tangent vector]]s to [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroups]] generate the Lie algebra. The structure of a Lie group is implicit in its algebra, and the structure of the Lie algebra is expressed by [[root system]]s and [[Root datum|root data]].

Lie theory has been particularly useful in [[mathematical physics]] since it describes important physical groups such as the [[Galilean group]], the [[Lorentz group]] and the [[Poincaré group]].

==Elementary Lie theory==
The [[one-parameter group]]s are the first instance of Lie theory. The [[compact space|compact]] case arises through [[Euler's formula]] in the [[complex plane]]. Other one-parameter groups occur in the [[split-complex number]] plane as the [[unit hyperbola]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lbrace \exp(i t) = \cosh(t) + i \sinh(t) : t \in R \rbrace,&lt;/math&gt;
and in the [[dual number]] plane as the line &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \exp(\varepsilon t) = 1 + \varepsilon t :  t \in R \rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;
In these cases the Lie algebra parameters have names: [[angle]], [[hyperbolic angle]], and [[slope]]. Using the appropriate "angle",  and a radial vector, any one of these planes can be given a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]]. Any one of these decompositions, or Lie algebra renderings, may be necessary for rendering the Lie subalgebra of a [[2 × 2 real matrix]].

There is a classical 3-parameter Lie group and algebra pair: the [[versor|quaternions of unit length]] which can be identified with the [[3-sphere]]. Its Lie algebra is the subspace of [[quaternion]] vectors. Since the [[commutator]] ij &amp;minus; ji = 2k, the Lie bracket in this algebra is twice the [[cross product]] of ordinary [[vector analysis]].

Another elementary 3-parameter example is given by the [[Heisenberg group]] and its Lie algebra.
Standard treatments of Lie theory often begin with the [[classical group]]s.

==History and scope==
Early expressions of Lie theory are found in books composed by [[Sophus Lie]] with [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]] and [[Georg Scheffers]] from 1888 to 1896.

In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.

According to historian Thomas W. Hawkins, it was [[Élie Cartan]] that made Lie theory what it is:
:While Lie had many fertile ideas, Cartan was primarily responsible for the extensions and applications of his theory that have made it a basic component of modern mathematics. It was he who, with some help from [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]], developed the seminal, essentially algebraic ideas of [[Wilhelm Killing|Killing]] into the theory of the structure and representation of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s that plays such a fundamental role in present-day Lie theory. And although Lie envisioned applications of his theory to geometry, it was Cartan who actually created them, for example through his theories of symmetric and generalized spaces, including all the attendant apparatus ([[moving frame]]s, exterior [[differential form]]s, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hawkins (1996) ''[[Historia Mathematica]]'' 23(1):92–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of Lie theory==

Lie theory is frequently built upon a study of the classical [[linear algebraic group]]s. Special branches include [[Weyl group]]s, [[Coxeter group]]s, and [[Building (mathematics)|buildings]]. The classical subject has been extended to [[Group of Lie type|Groups of Lie type]].

In 1900 [[David Hilbert]] challenged Lie theorists with his [[Hilbert's fifth problem|Fifth Problem]] presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris.

These computer algebra systems are sometimes combined with "front end" programs that provide a better user interface, such as the general-purpose [[GNU TeXmacs]].

===Functionality===
Below is a summary of significantly developed ''symbolic'' functionality in each of the systems.

Those which do not "edit equations" may have a [[GUI]], plotting, ASCII graphic formulae and math font printing. The ability to generate plaintext files is also a sought-after feature because it allows a work to be understood by people who do not have a computer algebra system installed.

===Operating system support===
The software can run under their respective [[operating system]]s natively without [[emulator|emulation]]. Some systems must be compiled first using an appropriate compiler for the source language and target platform. For some platforms, only older releases of the software may be available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">In [[mathematics]], ideas are supposedly not accepted as fact until they have been rigorously proved. However, there have been some ideas that were fairly accepted in the past but which were subsequently shown to be false. This article is meant to serve as a repository for compiling a list of such ideas.

*The idea of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] that all numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two [[integer|whole number]]s. This was disproved by one of [[Pythagoras]]' own disciples, [[Hippasus]], who showed that the square root of two is what we today call an [[irrational number]]. One story claims that he was thrown off the ship in which he and some other Pythagoreans were sailing because his discovery was too heretical.
*[[Fermat]] conjectured that all numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;2^{2^m}+1&lt;/math&gt; (what we call [[Fermat number]]s) were prime. This, however, was disproved by [[Euler]].
*The idea that [[transcendental number]]s were unusual. Disproved by [[Georg Cantor]] who [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|showed]] that there are so many transcendental numbers that it is impossible to make a one-to-one mapping between them and the [[algebraic number]]s. In other words, the [[cardinality]] of the set of transcendentals (denoted &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;) is greater than that of the set of algebraic numbers (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;).
*[[Bernhard Riemann]], at the end of his famous 1859 paper "[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]", stated (based on his results) that the [[logarithmic integral function|logarithmic integral]] gives a somewhat too high estimate of the [[prime-counting function]]. The evidence also seemed to indicate this. However, in 1914 [[J. E. Littlewood]] proved that this was not always the case, and in fact it is now known that the first ''x'' for which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\pi(x)\,&gt;\,\mathrm{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; occurs somewhere before 10&lt;sup&gt;317&lt;/sup&gt;. See [[Skewes' number]] for more detail.
*Naïvely it might be expected that a continuous function must have a derivative or else that the set of points where it is not differentiable should be "small" in some sense. This was disproved in 1872 by [[Karl Weierstrass]], using earlier found examples of functions that were continuous but nowhere differentiable (see [[Weierstrass function]]). According to Weierstrass in his paper, earlier mathematicians including [[Gauss]] had often assumed that such functions did not exist.
*It was conjectured in 1919 by [[George Pólya]], based on the evidence, that most numbers less than any particular limit have an odd number of [[prime factor]]s. However, this [[Pólya conjecture]] was disproved in 1958. It turns out that for some values of the limit (such as values a bit more than 906 million), most numbers less than the limit have an even number of prime factors.
*[[Erik Christopher Zeeman]] tried for 7 years to prove that one cannot untie a [[knot theory|knot]] on a [[n-sphere|4-sphere]]. Then one day he decided to try to prove the opposite, and he succeeded in a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19526131.900-interview-why-mathematics-is-beautiful.html Why mathematics is beautiful] in [[New Scientist]], 21 July 2007, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
*A "theorem" of [[Jan-Erik Roos]] in 1961 stated that in an [AB4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;] [[abelian category]], lim&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes on [[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences. This "theorem" was used by many people since then, but it was disproved by counterexample in 2002 by [[Amnon Neeman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/aeem2yx884nnufxn/ "A counterexample to a 1961 'theorem' in homological algebra"] by Amnon Neeman, ''Inventiones mathematicae'', 148, 2, pp. 397-420, May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8025">In [[mathematics]], an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] or [[transformation (mathematics)|transform]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from one [[function space|space of functions]] to another. Operators occur commonly in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and mathematics. Many are [[integral operator]]s and [[differential operator]]s.

In the following ''L'' is an operator

:&lt;math&gt;L:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;

which takes a function &lt;math&gt;y\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; to another function &lt;math&gt;L[y]\in\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; are some unspecified [[function space]]s, such as [[Hardy space]], [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space]], [[Sobolev space]], or, more vaguely, the space of [[holomorphic function]]s.

This page lists some important classes of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] used in [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. A '''matrix''' (plural matrices, or less commonly matrixes) is a rectangular [[Array data structure|array]] of [[number]]s called ''entries''. Matrices have a long history of both study and application, leading to diverse ways of classifying matrices. A first group is matrices satisfying concrete conditions of the entries, including constant matrices. An important example is the [[identity matrix]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;
I_n = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further ways of classifying matrices are according to their [[eigenvalue]]s or by imposing conditions on the [[matrix product|product]] of the matrix with other matrices.  Finally, many domains, both in mathematics and other sciences including [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] have particular matrices that are applied chiefly in these areas.

==Matrices with explicitly constrained entries==
The following lists matrices whose entries are subject to certain conditions. Many of them apply to ''square matrices'' only, that is matrices with the same number of columns and rows. The [[main diagonal]] of a square matrix is the [[diagonal]] joining the upper left corner and the lower right one or equivalently the entries ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The other diagonal is called anti-diagonal (or counter-diagonal).

==Matrices satisfying conditions on products or inverses==
A number of matrix-related notions is about properties of products or inverses of the given matrix. The [[matrix product]] of a ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' and a ''n''-by-''k'' matrix ''B'' is the ''m''-by-''k'' matrix ''C'' given by
:&lt;math&gt; (C)_{i,j} = \sum_{r=1}^n A_{i,r}B_{r,j}.&lt;/math&gt;
This matrix product is denoted ''AB''. Unlike the product of numbers, matrix products are not [[commutative]], that is to say ''AB'' need not be equal to ''BA''. A number of notions are concerned with the failure of this commutativity. An [[inverse of a matrix|inverse]] of square matrix ''A'' is a matrix ''B'' (necessarily of the same dimension as ''A'') such that ''AB'' = ''I''. Equivalently, ''BA'' = ''I''. An inverse need not exist. If it exists, ''B'' is uniquely determined, and is also called ''the'' inverse of ''A'', denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24165">{{Lie groups |Simple}}

In [[mathematics]], the [[simple Lie group]]s were first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and later perfected by [[Élie Cartan]]. This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification. 

The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of [[simple Lie algebra]]s and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s.  See also the [[table of Lie groups]] for a smaller list of groups that commonly occur in [[theoretical physics]], and the [[Bianchi classification]] for groups of dimension at most 3. 

== Simple Lie groups ==

Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a [[simple Lie group]]. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is [[simple group|simple]] as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether '''R''' is a simple Lie group. 

The most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed ''connected'' normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but '''R''' is not simple. 

In this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed.  Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a [[covering space#universal covers|universal cover]], whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.

== Simple Lie algebras ==

The Lie algebra of a simple Lie group is a simple Lie algebra. This is a one-to-one correspondence between connected simple Lie groups with [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] center and simple Lie algebras of dimension greater than 1. (Authors differ on whether the one-dimensional Lie algebra should be counted as simple.)

Over the complex numbers the semisimple Lie algebras are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s, of types "ABCDEFG". If ''L'' is a real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is a simple complex Lie algebra, unless ''L'' is already 
the complexification of a Lie algebra, in which case the complexification of ''L'' is a product of two copies of ''L''. This reduces the problem of classifying the real simple Lie algebras to that of finding all the [[real form]]s of each complex simple Lie algebra (i.e., real Lie algebras whose complexification is the given complex Lie algebra). There are always at least 2 such forms: a split form and a compact form, and there are usually a few others. The different real forms correspond to the classes of automorphisms of order at most 2 of the complex Lie algebra.

== Symmetric spaces ==

Symmetric spaces are classified as follows. 

First, the universal cover of a symmetric space is still symmetric, so we can reduce to the case of simply connected symmetric spaces. (For example, the universal cover of a real projective plane is a sphere.)

Second, the product of symmetric spaces is symmetric, so we may as well just classify the irreducible simply connected ones (where irreducible means they cannot be written as a product of smaller symmetric spaces). 

The irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces are the real line, and exactly two symmetric spaces corresponding to  each ''non-compact'' simple Lie group ''G'',
one compact and one non-compact. The non-compact one is a cover of the quotient of ''G'' by a maximal compact subgroup ''H'', and the compact one is a cover of the quotient of
the compact form of ''G'' by the same subgroup ''H''. This duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces is a generalization of the well known duality between spherical and hyperbolic geometry.

== Hermitian symmetric spaces ==

A symmetric space with a compatible complex structure is called Hermitian.  The compact simply connected irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces fall into 4 infinite families with 2 exceptional ones left over, and each has a non-compact dual. In addition the complex plane is also a Hermitian symmetric space; this gives the complete list of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.

The four families are the types A&amp;nbsp;III, B&amp;nbsp;I and D&amp;nbsp;I for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, D&amp;nbsp;III, and C&amp;nbsp;I, and the two exceptional ones are types E&amp;nbsp;III and E&amp;nbsp;VII of complex dimensions 16 and 27.

== Notation ==

&lt;math&gt; \mathbb {R, C, H, O} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; stand for the real numbers, complex numbers, [[quaternions]], and [[octonion]]s.

In the symbols such as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; for the exceptional groups, the exponent &amp;minus;26 is the signature of an invariant symmetric bilinear form that is negative definite on the maximal compact subgroup. It is equal to the dimension of the group minus twice the dimension of a maximal compact subgroup.

The fundamental group listed in the table below is the fundamental group of the simple group with trivial center. 
Other simple groups with the same Lie algebra correspond to subgroups of this fundamental group (modulo the action of the outer automorphism group).

==Notes==
:{{Note|Note†|†}} The group '''R''' is not simple as an abstract group, and according to most (but not all) definitions this is not a simple Lie group. Most authors do not count its Lie algebra as a simple Lie algebra. It is listed here so that the list of irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces is complete. Note that '''R''' is the only such non-compact symmetric space without a compact dual (although it has a compact quotient ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is mainly used for the evaluation of [[nuclear medicine]] [[medical imaging|imaging]] data after the injection of a labeled ligand that binds reversibly to specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] or [[enzyme]].

In conventional [[Multi-compartment model|compartmental analysis]], an [[iterative method]] is used to fit the individual model parameters in the solution of a compartmental model of specific configuration to the measurements with a measured plasma time-activity curve that serves as an forcing (input) function, and the binding of the tracer can then be described. Graphical analysis is a simplified method that transforms the model equations into a linear equation evaluated at multiple time points and provides fewer parameters (i.e., slope and intercept). Although the slope and the intercept can be interpreted in terms of a combination of model parameters if a compartmental model configuration is assumed, the graphical methods are independent of any specific model configuration. In case of irreversible tracers, certain fraction of the radioactivity is trapped in the tissue or the binding site during the course of the experiment, whereas reversible tracers show uptake and loss from all compartments throughout the study. The theoretical foundation of graphical analysis for irreversible tracers (also called [[Patlak plot|Patlak graphical analysis]] or [[Patlak plot]]) was laid by [[Clifford Patlak]] and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.S.

Based on the original work of Patlak, [[Jean Logan]] and her colleagues&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; from [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] extended the method to tracers with reversible kinetics.

== Description ==

The kinetics of radiolabeled compounds in a compartmental system can be described in terms of a set of first-order, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=K. Godfrey | title=Compartmental Models and Their Application | publisher=Academic Press, New York | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J.A. Jacquez | title=Compartmental Analysis in Biology and Medicine | publisher=The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor | edition=2nd | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The time course of the activity in the multicompartmental system driven by a metabolite-corrected plasma input function &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be described by:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \mathbf{KA} + \mathbf{Q}C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector of activity concentration for each compartment at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the transfer constants between compartments, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of plasma-to-tissue transfer constants. Patlak and Blasberg&lt;ref name="Patlak1985" /&gt; showed that the above equation can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t A(\tau) \, d\tau = -\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_n^T&lt;/math&gt; represents a row vector of 1s and &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  The total activity in the [[region of interest]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is a combination of radioactivities from all compartments plus a plasma volume fraction (&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; and thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the following linear equation:

: &lt;math&gt;{{\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) {{\int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} + {{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t &gt; t'&lt;/math&gt;, Patlak and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the steady-state condition.  When this condition is satisfied, the intercept has reached its constant value so that after some time a plot of &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} C_p(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} \mathrm{ROI}(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a straight line with slope &lt;math&gt;(-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} + V_p)&lt;/math&gt; and intercept &lt;math&gt;{{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

For a catenary two-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; (forward transport from plasma to tissue), &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; (reverse transport from tissue to plasma), &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; ([[Binding (molecular)|binding]] parameter proportional to &lt;math&gt;B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;k_4&lt;/math&gt; (dissociation constant) to analyze enzyme or receptor system, the slope represents the total [[distribution volume]] (&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt;) and is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_1}{k_2}(1+\frac{k_3}{k_4}) + V_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_3 = B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_4 = k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_3}{k_4} = \frac{B_\max}{K_d}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_d = k_\mathrm{off}/k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;B_\max&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of ligand binding sites, &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[dissociation constant]] for the ligand-binding site complex, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding association constant, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding dissociation constant.  For a one-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope is &lt;math&gt;\lambda + V_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;{K_1}/{k_2}&lt;/math&gt;) and the intercept is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{k_2(1+V_p/\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

'''''Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences''''' is a 1966 textbook by [[mathematician]] [[Mary L. Boas]] intended to develop skills in mathematical problem solving needed for junior to senior-graduate courses in [[engineering]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]]. The book provides a comprehensive survey of [[mathematical physics|analytic techniques]] and provides careful statements of important theorems while omitting most detailed proofs. Each section contains a large number of problems, with selected answers. [[Computational physics|Numerical computational approaches]] using computers are outside the scope of the book.

The book, now in its third edition, was still widely used in university classrooms as of 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=Donald|title=Book Reviews|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|year=1999|volume=67|issue=2|pages=165–169|doi=10.1119/1.19216}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and is frequently cited in other textbooks and scientific papers.

As the term is understood by [[mathematician]]s, '''folk mathematics''' or '''mathematical folklore''' is the body of theorems, definitions, proofs, or mathematical facts or techniques that circulate among mathematicians by word of mouth but have not appeared in print, either in books or in scholarly journals. Knowledge of folklore is the coin of the realm of academic mathematics.{{OR|date=July 2016}}

Quite important at times for researchers are '''folk theorems''', which are results known, at least to experts in a field, and considered to have established status, but not published in complete form. Sometimes these are only alluded to in the public literature. 
An example is a book of exercises, described on the back cover:
{{quote|This book contains almost 350 exercises in the basics of [[ring theory]]. The problems form the "folklore" of ring theory, and the solutions are given in as much detail as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Grigore Calugareau &amp; Peter Hamburg (1998) ''Exercises in Basic Ring Theory'', Kluwer,[{{isbn|0792349180}}]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another distinct category is '''wellknowable''' mathematics, a term introduced by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. This consists of matters that are known and factual, but not in active circulation in relation with current research. Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the actual context in which research work is done.

Some people, principally non-mathematicians, use the term ''folk mathematics'' to refer to the [[informal mathematics]] studied in many ethno-cultural studies of mathematics.

==Stories, sayings and jokes==
{{See also|Mathematical joke}}
{{Wikiquote|Mathematics}}
{{Wikiquote|Mathematicians}}
Mathematical folklore may also refer to unusual (and possibly apocryphal) stories or jokes involving mathematicians or mathematics that are told verbally in mathematics departments. Compilations include tales collected in [[G. H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' and {{Harv|Krantz|2002}}; examples include:
*[[Galileo]] dropping weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].
*An apple falling on [[Isaac Newton]]'s head to inspire his theory of gravitation.
*The drinking, duel and early death of [[Galois]].
*[[Richard Feynman]] cracking safes in the Manhattan Project.
*[[Alfréd Rényi]]'s definition of a mathematician: "a device for turning coffee into theorems".
*The "[[turtles all the way down]]" story told by [[Stephen Hawking]].
*[[Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's Last Theorem#Fermat's conjecture|lost simple proof]].
*The unwieldy proof and associated controversies of the [[Four Color Theorem]].

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], a '''metatheorem''' is a statement about a [[formal system]] proven in a [[metalanguage]]. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a [[metatheory]], and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the [[object theory]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A formal system is determined by a formal language and a [[deductive system]] ([[axiom]]s and [[rules of inference]]). The formal system can be used to prove particular sentences of the formal language with that system. Metatheorems, however, are proved externally to the system in question, in its metatheory. Common metatheories used in logic are [[set theory]] (especially in [[model theory]]) and [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (especially in [[proof theory]]). Rather than demonstrating particular sentences to be provable, metatheorems may show that each of a broad class of sentences can be proved, or show that certain sentences cannot be proved.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Examples==
Examples of metatheorems include:
* The [[deduction theorem]] for [[first-order logic]] says that a sentence of the form φ→ψ is provable from a set of axioms ''A'' if and only if the sentence ψ is provable from the system whose axioms consist of φ and all the axioms of ''A''. 
* The [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#Class existence theorem|class existence theorem]] of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] states that for every formula whose [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s range only over sets, there is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] consisting of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s satisfying the formula.
* [[Consistency proof]]s of systems such as [[Peano arithmetic]].

"Mughal Architecture" is the type of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] developed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Iranian architecture|Persian]], Turkish and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of [[Babur]] at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson [[Akbar]] built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were [[Agra Fort]], the fort-city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Buland Darwaza]]. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] commissioned the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]].

Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], who constructed the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Jama Masjid (Delhi)|Jama Masjid]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens in Lahore]]. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.

==Monuments==
===Agra Fort===
{{main article|Agra fort}}
Agra fort is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in [[Agra]], Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by [[Akbar The Great]] during 1565 to 1574. The [[architecture]] of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the [[Rajput]] planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.

=== Humayun's Tomb===
{{main article|Humayun's Tomb}}
'''Humayun's tomb''' is the [[tomb]] of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress [[Bega Begum]] (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.

===Fatehpur Sikri===
{{main article|Fatehpur Sikri}}
Akbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/excavation-at-akbars-fort-at-fatehpur-sikri-reveals-flourishing-jain-and-hindu-habitation/1/243578.html|title=Excavation at Akbars fort at Fatehpur Sikri reveals flourishing Jain and Hindu habitation|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book/story-4DfRoVJ6tVxmWzz1RztA5I.html|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.

It contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration.  The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti.  The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...

The Haramsara, the royal seraglio  in [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in [[Ain-i-Akbari]], the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the [[eunuch]]s were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful [[Rajput]] guards.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page 146, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jodha Bai's Palace====
This is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor ''haramsara'' (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the [[facade]] to create a kind of [[porch]] leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of [[Hindu]] sculptural motifs. 
The glazed tiles on the roofs from [[Multan]] have an eye catching shade of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page151, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was built in honour of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani#The misnomer of Jodhabai|Jodha Bai]], mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar.  Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.

Buland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.

====Inscription====

A [[chronogram]] is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,

{{Quote|In the reign of King of the world Akbar,
To whom is due the order in the country.
The Sheikh-ul-Islam adorned the mosque.
Which for its elegance deserves as much reverence as the Ka'ba.
The year of the completion of this magnificent edifice.
Is found in the words: duplicate of the Masjidi'l-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta (2013), page 172-176, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hill", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The Tomb of [[Sheikh Salim Chishti]] is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350&amp;nbsp;ft. by 440&amp;nbsp;ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.

==Shah Jahan==
The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in [[Lahore]] was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.
Rather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at [[Agra Fort|Agra]], [[Delhi Fort|Delhi]] and [[Lahore Fort|Lahore]]. Some examples include the [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, the tomb of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Lahore Fort]] and the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the  [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], and [[Naulakha pavilion]], which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in [[Thatta]] called [[Shahjahan Mosque]]. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now [[Delhi]]. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-[[Diwan-i-Aam]] and [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.

===Taj Mahal===
{{main article|Taj Mahal}}

The Taj Mahal, a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the "[[teardrop on the cheek of time]]" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The building's longest [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[symmetry]] runs through the entire complex except for the [[sarcophagus]] of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror [[mosque]] in red sandstone, to complement the [[Mecca]]-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used "[[pietra dura]]", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.

===Wazir Khan Masjid===
{{main|Wazir Khan Mosque}}
[[File:Wazir_Khan_Mosque_by_Moiz.jpg|thumb|[[Wazir Khan Mosque]], A [[Mughal era]] mosque in [[Lahore]]]]
The Wazir Khan Masjid was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1634, and completed in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conservation of the Wazir Khan Mosque Lahore: Preliminary Report on Condition and Risk Assessment|url=http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/6585/original/DPC3347.pdf?1384798179|accessdate=25 August 2016|agency=Aga Khan Development Network|date=2012|quote=The Wazir Khan Mosque was built in 1634-35 AD (1044-45 AH), by Hakim ’Ali ud din* a governor of the Punjab in the early part of the reign of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masson|first1=Vadim Mikhaĭlovich|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: Development in contrast : from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century|date=2003|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231038761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wazir Khan Masjid is renowned for its intricate [[faience]] tile work known as ''kashi-kari'', as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era [[fresco]]es.

A majority of these buildings and the mohallas (local neighbourhoods) in which they are situated form a unique heritage footprint. The work consequently carried out by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (A.K.T.C.) and the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme (AKHCP) was initiated under a 2007 public-private partnership framework agreement with the Government of Punjab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shalimar Gardens===
{{main|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore}}
The Shalimar Gardens (1641–1642) built on the orders of Bahadur Shah Zafar in Lahore, Pakistan, is also on the UNESCO world heritage list.

===Shah Jahan Mosque===
[[File:Shah_Jahan_Mosque_Center_(20673302596).jpg|thumb|[[Shah Jahan Mosque, Thatta|Shah Jahan Mosque]] in [[Sindh]], Pakistan]]
The [[Shah Jahan Mosque, Thatta|Shah Jahan Mosque]] is the [[Jama Masjid|central mosque]] for the city of [[Thatta]], in the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]].

==Aurangzeb and later Mughal architecture==
{{further information|Bibi Ka Maqbara}}
In [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with [[stucco]] ornament. [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Lucknow]] have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).

===Badshahi Masjid===
{{main|Badshahi Mosque}}
The [[Badshahi Mosque|Badshahi Masjid]] in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an [[Idgah (place)|''idgah'']]. The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The [[minarets]] are {{convert|196|ft|m}} tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=whc.unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1277/ |title=Badshahi Mosque, Lahore &amp;ndash; UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional monuments===
Additional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant [[Zinat al-Masjid]] in [[Daryaganj]] was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter [[Zinat-al-Nissa]]. Aurangzeb's sister [[Roshan-Ara]] who died in 1671. The tomb of [[Roshanara Begum]] and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]]  was a mausoleum built by Prince [[Azam Shah]], son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]]. The [[Alamgiri Gate]], built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

Another construction of the Mughal era is [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also known as "Fort Aurangabad"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.

==Mughal gardens==
{{main article|Mughal garden}}
[[File:Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness) terrace view from Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure) terrace.jpg|thumb|The [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]] are among the most famous Mughal gardens.]]
Mughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the [[Char Bagh]] gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as [[Pinjore]] Garden in [[Haryana]].

==Mughal bridges==
[[Shahi Bridge, Jaunpur]] was constructed during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]].

'''[[Logic]]'''  is the formal science of using [[reason]] and is considered a branch of both [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]]. Logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments, both through the study of [[formal system]]s of inference and the study of arguments in [[natural language]]. The scope of logic can therefore be very large, ranging from core topics such as the study of [[fallacies]] and [[paradox]]es, to specialized analyses of reasoning such as [[probability]], correct reasoning, and arguments involving [[causality]]. One of the aims of logic is to identify the correct (or [[Validity (logic)|valid]]) and incorrect (or [[fallacy|fallacious]]) [[inference]]s. Logicians study the criteria for the evaluation of [[logical argument|arguments]].

=== Fallacies ===

* [[Fallacy]] &amp;nbsp;([[List of fallacies|list]]) &amp;ndash; incorrect argumentation in reasoning resulting in a misconception or presumption. By accident or design, fallacies may exploit emotional triggers in the listener or interlocutor (appeal to emotion), or take advantage of social relationships between people (e.g. argument from authority). Fallacious arguments are often structured using rhetorical patterns that obscure any logical argument. Fallacies can be used to win arguments regardless of the merits.  There are dozens of types of fallacies.

== Formal logic ==

* [[Formal logic]] &amp;ndash; Mathematical logic, symbolic logic and formal logic are largely, if not completely synonymous. The essential feature of this field is the use of [[formal language]]s to express the ideas whose logical validity is being studied.

=== Computability theory ===
[[Computability theory]] &amp;ndash; branch of mathematical logic that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and [[Turing degree]]s. The field has grown to include the study of generalized computability and definability. The basic questions addressed by recursion theory are "What does it mean for a function from the natural numbers to themselves to be computable?" and "How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?". The answers to these questions have led to a rich theory that is still being actively researched.

The '''''Princeton Lectures in Analysis''''' is a series of four [[mathematics]] textbooks, each covering a different area of [[mathematical analysis]]. They were written by [[Elias M. Stein]] and Rami Shakarchi and published by [[Princeton University Press]] between 2003 and 2011. They are, in order, ''Fourier Analysis: An Introduction''; ''Complex Analysis''; ''Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces''; and ''Functional Analysis: Introduction to Further Topics in Analysis''.

Stein and Shakarchi wrote the books based on a sequence of intensive undergraduate courses Stein began teaching in the spring of 2000 at [[Princeton University]]. At the time Stein was a mathematics professor at Princeton and Shakarchi was a graduate student in mathematics. Though Shakarchi graduated in 2002, the collaboration continued until the final volume was published in 2011. The series emphasizes the unity among the branches of analysis and the applicability of analysis to other areas of mathematics.

The ''Princeton Lectures in Analysis'' has been identified as a well written and influential series of textbooks, suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in mathematics.

F. |last2=Robertson |title=Elias Menachem Stein |date=Feb 2010 |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Stein.html |accessdate=Sep 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the spring of 2000, Stein taught a sequence of four intensive undergraduate courses in analysis at [[Princeton University]], where he was a mathematics professor. At the same time he collaborated with Rami Shakarchi, then a graduate student in Princeton's math department studying under [[Charles Fefferman]], to turn each of the courses into a textbook. Stein taught [[Fourier analysis]] in that first semester, and by the fall of 2000 the first manuscript was nearly finished. That fall Stein taught the course in [[complex analysis]] while he and Shakarchi worked on the corresponding manuscript. Paul Hagelstein, then a [[postdoctoral scholar]] in the Princeton math department, was a teaching assistant for this course. In spring 2001, when Stein moved on to the [[real analysis]] course, Hagelstein started the sequence anew, beginning with the Fourier analysis course. Hagelstein and his students used Stein and Shakarchi's drafts as texts, and they made suggestions to the authors as they prepared the manuscripts for publication.&lt;ref name=fefferman&gt;{{cite news |first1=Charles |last1=Fefferman |authorlink1=Charles Fefferman |first2=Robert |last2=Fefferman |authorlink2=Robert Fefferman |first3=Paul |last3=Hagelstein |first4=Nataša |last4=Pavlović |first5=Lillian |last5=Pierce|author5-link=Lillian Pierce |title=Princeton Lectures in Analysis by Elias M.

Shakarchi earned his Ph.D. from Princeton in 2002&lt;ref name=duren&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Duran |authorlink=Peter Duren |title=Princeton Lectures in Analysis. By Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=115 |number=9 | date=Nov  2008 |pages=863–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[London]] to work in finance. Nonetheless he continued working on the books, even as his employer, [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|collapsed]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt; The first two volumes were published in 2003. The third followed in 2005, and the fourth in 2011. [[Princeton University Press]] published all four.&lt;ref name=ss1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss3/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss4/&gt;

== Contents ==

The volumes are split into seven to ten chapters each. Each chapter begins with an epigraph providing context for the material and ends with a list of challenges for the reader, split into Exercises, which range in difficulty, and more difficult Problems. Throughout the authors emphasize the unity among the branches of analysis, often referencing one branch within another branch's book. They also provide applications of the theory to other fields of mathematics, particularly [[partial differential equation]]s and [[number theory]].&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;

''Fourier Analysis'' covers the [[Discrete Fourier transform|discrete]], [[Continuous Fourier transform|continuous]], and [[Discrete Fourier transform|finite]] [[Fourier transform]]s and their properties, including inversion. It also presents applications to partial differential equations, [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], and other topics.&lt;ref name=ss1&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Fourier Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Lebesgue integration]] is not introduced until the third book, the authors use [[Riemann integration]] in this volume.&lt;ref name=duren/&gt; They begin with Fourier analysis because of its central role within the historical development and contemporary practice of analysis.&lt;ref name=gouvea/&gt;

''Complex Analysis'' treats the standard topics of a course in complex variables as well as several applications to other areas of mathematics.&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=shiu/&gt; The chapters cover the [[complex plane]], [[Cauchy's integral theorem]], [[meromorphic function]]s, connections to Fourier analysis, [[entire function]]s, the [[gamma function]], the [[Riemann zeta function]], [[conformal map]]s, [[elliptic function]]s, and [[theta function]]s.&lt;ref name=ss2&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Complex Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Real Analysis'' begins with [[measure theory]], Lebesgue integration, and [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] in [[Euclidean space]]. It then covers [[Hilbert space]]s before returning to measure and integration in the context of abstract measure spaces. It concludes with a chapter on [[Hausdorff measure]] and [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=ss3&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Real Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Functional Analysis'' has chapters on several advanced topics in analysis: [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]], [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], the [[Baire category theorem]], [[probability theory]] including [[Brownian motion]], [[several complex variables]], and [[oscillatory integral]]s.&lt;ref name=ss4&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Functional Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

[[Peter Duren]] compared Stein and Shakarchi's attempt at a unified treatment favorably with [[Walter Rudin]]'s textbook ''Real and Complex Analysis'', which Duren calls too terse. On the other hand, Duren noted that this sometimes comes at the expense of topics that reside naturally within only one branch. He mentioned in particular geometric aspects of complex analysis covered in [[Lars Ahlfors]]'s textbook but noted that Stein and Shakarchi also treat some topics Ahlfors skips.&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''projection''' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or other [[mathematical structure]]) into  a subset (or sub-structure), which is equal to its square for [[function composition|mapping composition]] (or, in other words, which is [[idempotence|idempotent]]). The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to a subspace of a projection is also called a ''projection'', even if the idempotence property is lost.
An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (paper sheet).  The projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet. The shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself (idempotence). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in [[Euclidean geometry]] to denote the projection of the [[Euclidean space]] of three dimensions onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: 
* {{anchor|Central projection}}The '''projection from a point onto a plane''' or '''central projection''': If ''C'' is a point, called the '''center of projection''', then the projection of a point ''P'' different from ''C'' onto a plane that does not contain ''C'' is the intersection of the line ''CP'' with the plane. The points ''P'' such that the line ''CP'' is parallel to the plane do not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see [[projective geometry]] for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point ''C'' itself is not defined.
* The '''projection parallel to a direction D, onto a plane''' or '''[[parallel projection]]''': The image of a point ''P'' is the intersection with the plane of the line parallel to ''D'' passing through ''P''. See {{slink|Affine space|Projection}} for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension.

The concept of '''projection''' in [[mathematics]] is a very old one, most likely having its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time differing versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations.

In [[cartography]], a [[map projection]] is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The [[3D projection]]s are also at the basis of the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. 

The need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of [[projective geometry]]. However, a [[projective transformation]] is a [[bijection]] of a projective space, a property ''not'' shared with the ''projections'' of this article.

== Definition ==
[[File:Proj-map.svg|thumb|191x191px|The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection π, for any map ''f'' and set X.]]
In an abstract setting we can generally say that a ''projection'' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or of a [[mathematical structure]]) which is [[idempotent]], which means that a projection is equal to its [[Function composition|composition]] with itself. A '''projection''' may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse. Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let ''p'' be an idempotent [[map (mathematics)|map]] from a set ''A'' into itself (thus ''p''∘''p'' = ''p'') and ''B'' = ''p''(''A'') be the image of ''p''. If we denote by π the map ''p'' viewed as a map from ''A'' onto ''B'' and by ''i'' the [[Injective function|injection]] of ''B'' into ''A'', then we have π.''i''= Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, π.''i'' = Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; implies that π∘''i'' is idempotent.

== Applications ==
The original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example:

* In [[set theory]]:
** An operation typified by the ''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[projection (set theory)|projection map]], written proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, that takes an element '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the [[cartesian product]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to the value proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;.  This map is always [[surjective]].
** A mapping that takes an element to its [[equivalence class]] under a given [[equivalence relation]] is known as the '''{{visible anchor|canonical projection}}'''.
** The evaluation map sends a function ''f'' to the value ''f''(''x'') for a fixed ''x''.  The space of functions ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; can be identified with the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in X}Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the evaluation map is a projection map from the cartesian product.

* [[Relational database]]s and [[query language]]s, the [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]] is a  [[unary operation]] written as &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{a_1, \ldots,a_n}( R )&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n&lt;/math&gt; is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  ''R'' is a [[Relation (database)|database-relation]].

* In [[spherical geometry]], projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by [[Ptolemy]] (~150) in his [[Planisphaerium]]. The method is called [[stereographic projection]] and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a ''pole'' C diametrically opposite the point of tangency.  Any point ''P'' on the sphere besides ''C'' determines a line ''CP'' intersecting the plane at the projected point for ''P''. The correspondence makes the sphere a [[one-point compactification]] for the plane when a [[point at infinity]] is included to correspond to ''C'', which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the [[complex plane]] where the compactification corresponds to the [[Riemann sphere]]. Alternatively, a [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemisphere]] is frequently projected onto a plane using the [[gnomonic projection]].

* In [[linear algebra]], a [[linear transformation]] that remains unchanged if applied twice (''p''(''u'') = ''p''(''p''(''u''))), in other words, an [[idempotent]] operator.  For example, the mapping that takes a point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three dimensions to the point (''x'', ''y'', 0) in the plane is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions ''n'' for the source and ''k'' ≤ ''n'' for the target of the mapping.  See [[orthogonal projection]], [[projection (linear algebra)]].  In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well.

* In [[differential topology]], any [[fiber bundle]] includes a projection map as part of its definition.  Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology, and is therefore open and surjective.

* In [[topology]], a [[retract]] is a continuous map ''r'': ''X'' → ''X'' which restricts to the identity map on its image.  This satisfies a similar idempotency condition ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r'' and can be considered a generalization of the projection map.  A retract which is [[homotopic]] to the identity is known as a [[deformation retract]].  This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism.

* The [[scalar resolute|scalar projection]] (or resolute) of one [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto another.

* In [[category theory]], the above notion of cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|categories]].  The [[product (category theory)|product]] of some objects has a '''canonical projection''' [[morphism]] to each factor.  This projection will take many forms in different categories.  The projection from the [[Cartesian product]] of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the [[product topology]] of [[topological space]]s (which is always surjective and [[open map|open]]), or from the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], etc.  Although these morphisms are often [[epimorphism]]s and even surjective, they do not have to be.

In [[mathematics]], '''restricted root systems''', sometimes called '''relative root systems''', are the [[root system]]s associated with a [[symmetric space]]. The associated finite reflection group is called the '''restricted Weyl group'''. The restricted root system of a symmetric space and its dual can be identified. For symmetric spaces of noncompact type arising as homogeneous spaces of a semisimple Lie group, the restricted root system and its Weyl group are related to the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] of the Lie group.

'''Reverse Polish notation''' ('''RPN'''), also known as '''Polish postfix notation''' or simply '''postfix notation''', is a mathematical notation in which [[Operation (mathematics)|operators]] follow their [[operand]]s, in contrast to [[Polish notation]] (PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed [[arity|number of operands]]. The description "Polish" refers to the [[nationality]] of [[logician]] [[Jan Łukasiewicz]],&lt;ref name="Łukasiewicz_1957"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Łukasiewicz |author-first=Jan |author-link=Jan Łukasiewicz |title=Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=1957}} (Reprinted by Garland Publishing in 1987. {{isbn|0-8240-6924-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; who invented this notation in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Charles Leonard |author-last=Hamblin |author-link=Charles Leonard Hamblin |date=1962 |title=Translation to and from Polish notation |journal=[[Computer Journal]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=210–213 |url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/3/210.full.pdf |doi=10.1093/comjnl/5.3.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball_1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms for RPN calculators |author-first=John A. |author-last=Ball |date=1978 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |isbn=0-471-03070-8 |quote=[…] In their advertisements and also in a letter to me, [[Hewlett-Packard]] Company (HP), the best known manufacturer of RPN calculators, says that RPN is based on a suggestion by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878-1956), and that RPN was invented and is patented by HP. Aside from the apparent contradiction in these two statements, I do not think that either of them is quite true. My first experience with RPN involved a nice old [[Friden EC-130]] desktop electronic calculator, circa 1964. The EC-130 has RPN with a push-down stack of four registers, all visible simultaneously on a cathode ray tube display. Furthermore, they are shown upside down, that is, the last-in-first-out register is at the bottom. […] Around 1966, the [[Monroe Epic]] calculator offered RPN with a stack of four, a printer, and either 14 or 42 step programmability. The instruction booklets with these two calculators make no mention of RPN or [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by [[Arthur Burks]], Don Warren, and Jesse Wright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2001990 |jstor=2001990 |title=An Analysis of a Logical Machine Using Parenthesis-Free Notation |journal=Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation |volume=8 |issue=46 |pages=53 |date=1954 |author-last1=Burks |author-first1=Arthur Walter |author-link1=Arthur Walter Burks |author-last2=Warren |author-first2=Don W. |author-last3=Wright |author-first3=Jesse B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was independently reinvented by [[Friedrich L. Bauer]] and [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] in the early 1960s to reduce [[computer memory]] access and utilize the [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] to evaluate [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]]. The [[algorithms]] and notation for this scheme were extended by [[Australia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[computer scientist]] [[Charles Leonard Hamblin|Charles L. Hamblin]] in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~peter/hamblin.html "Charles L. Hamblin and his work"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206093044/http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~peter/hamblin.html |date=2008-12-06 }} by Peter McBurney&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~peter/this-month/this-month-3-030303.html |title=Charles L.

One solution to the first problem was [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]'s Polish notation, which enables a writer of mathematical notation to instruct a reader the order in which to execute the operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, etc) without using brackets. Polish notation achieves this by having an operator (+, ×, etc) precede the operands to which it applies, e.g., +ab, instead of the usual, a+b.

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Hewlett-Packard]] used RPN in all of their desktop and hand-held calculators, and continued to use it in some into the 2010's.&lt;ref name="Osborne_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703841904576257440326458056 |url-access=subscription |title=Wall Street's Cult Calculator Turns 30 |author-first=Kristina |author-last=Peterson |date=2011-05-04 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316030830/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703841904576257440326458056 |archive-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[computer science]], reverse Polish notation is used in [[stack-oriented programming language|stack-oriented]] programming languages such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] and [[PostScript]].

Most of what follows is about [[binary operator]]s. An example of a [[unary operator]] whose standard notation may be interpreted as reverse Polish notation is the [[factorial]], "''n''!".

== Explanation ==
In reverse Polish notation, the [[Operation (mathematics)|operators]] follow their [[operands]]; for instance, to add 3 and 4, one would write {{nowrap|3 4 +}} rather than {{nowrap|3 + 4}}. If there are multiple operations, operators are given immediately after their second operands; so the expression written {{nowrap|3 − 4 + 5}} in conventional notation would be written {{nowrap|3 4 − 5 +}} in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it. An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by [[infix notation]]. While {{nowrap|3 − 4 × 5}} can also be written {{nowrap|3 − (4 × 5)}}, that means something quite different from {{nowrap|(3 − 4) × 5}}. In reverse Polish notation, the former could be written {{nowrap|3 4 5 × −}}, which unambiguously means {{nowrap|3 (4 5 ×) −}} which reduces to {{nowrap|3 20 −}}; the latter could be written {{nowrap|3 4 − 5 ×}} (or {{nowrap|5 3 4 − ×}}, if keeping similar formatting), which unambiguously means {{nowrap|(3 4 −) 5 ×}}.

== Practical implications ==
In comparison testing of reverse Polish notation with algebraic notation, reverse Polish has been found to lead to faster calculations, for two reasons. Because reverse Polish calculators do not need expressions to be parenthesized, fewer operations need to be entered to perform typical calculations. Additionally, users of reverse Polish calculators made fewer mistakes than for other types of calculator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Human behaviour and performance in calculator use with Algebraic and Reverse Polish Notation |journal=Ergonomics |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1011 |date=1979 |doi=10.1080/00140137908924675 |author-first1=D.

== Postfix evaluation algorithm ==

The following algorithm evaluates postfix expressions using a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], with the expression processed from left to right:

 for each token in the postfix expression:
   if token is an operator:
     operand_2 ← pop from the stack
     operand_1 ← pop from the stack
     result ← evaluate token with operand_1 and operand_2
     push result back onto the stack
   else if token is an operand:
     push token onto the stack
 result ← pop from the stack

The following algorithm produces the same results of the previous one, but the expression is processed from right to left:

 for each token in the reversed postfix expression:
   if token is an operator:
     push token onto the operator stack
     pending_operand ← False
   else if token is an operand:
     operand ← token
     if pending_operand is True:
       while the operand stack is not empty:
         operand_1 ← pop from the operand stack
         operator ← pop from the operator stack
         operand ← evaluate operator with operand_1 and operand
     push operand onto the operand stack
     pending_operand ← True
 result ← pop from the operand stack

=== Example ===
The infix expression {{nowrap|((15 ÷ (7 − (1 + 1))) × 3) − (2 + (1 + 1))}} can be written like this in reverse Polish notation:
: {{nowrap|15 7 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + −}}

* Evaluating this postfix expression with the above left-to-right algorithm yields (red items are the stack contents, bold is the current token):

 '''15''' 7 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15}} '''7''' 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15 7}} '''1''' 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15 7 1}} '''1''' + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15 7 1 1}} '''+''' − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15 7     2}} '''−''' ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
 {{color|red|15         5}} '''÷''' 3 × 2 1 1 + + − =
              {{color|red|3}} '''3''' × 2 1 1 + + − =
              {{color|red|3 3}} '''×''' 2 1 1 + + − =
                  {{color|red|9}} '''2''' 1 1 + + − =
                  {{color|red|9 2}} '''1''' 1 + + − =
                  {{color|red|9 2 1}} '''1''' + + − =
                  {{color|red|9 2 1 1}} '''+''' + − =
                  {{color|red|9 2     2}} '''+''' − =
                  {{color|red|9         4}} '''−''' =
                              {{color|red|5}} =
                              '''5'''

* Evaluating this postfix expression with the above right-to-left algorithm yields:

 15 7 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 {{color|red|1 1 +}} + − =
 15 7 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × {{color|red|2     '''2''' +}} − =
 15 7 {{color|red|1 1 +}} − ÷ 3 ×         '''4''' − =
 15 {{color|red|7     '''2''' −}} ÷ 3 ×         4 − =
 {{color|red|15         '''5''' ÷}} 3 ×         4 − =
 {{color|red|             '''3''' 3 ×}}         4 − =
 {{color|red|                 '''9'''         4 −}} =
                              '''5'''

The following table shows the state of the operand stack at each stage of the above left-to-right algorithm:

{| class="wikitable"

The above example could be rewritten by following the "chain calculation" method described by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] for their series of reverse Polish notation calculators:&lt;ref&gt;http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/17b2pChain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As was demonstrated in the Algebraic mode, it is usually easier (fewer keystrokes) in working a problem like this to begin with the arithmetic operations inside the parentheses first.
: {{nowrap|1 2 + 4 × 5 + 3 −}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Converting from infix notation ==
{{main article|Shunting-yard algorithm}}
[[Edsger Dijkstra]] invented the [[shunting-yard algorithm]] to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions (reverse Polish notation), so named because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]].

There are other ways of producing postfix expressions from infix expressions. Most [[operator-precedence parser]]s can be modified to produce postfix expressions; in particular, once an [[abstract syntax tree]] has been constructed, the corresponding postfix expression is given by a simple [[post-order traversal]] of that tree.

== Implementations ==
=== History of implementations ===
The first computers to implement architectures enabling reverse Polish notation were the English Electric Company's [[English Electric KDF9|KDF9]] machine, which was announced in 1960 and delivered (i.e. made available commercially) in 1963, and the American [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]], announced in 1961 and also delivered in 1963. One of the designers of the B5000, [[Robert S. Barton]], later wrote that he developed reverse Polish notation independently of Hamblin sometime in 1958 after reading a 1954 textbook on symbolic logic by [[Irving Copi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107105/1/oh098b5c.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422070048/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107105/1/oh098b5c.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }} A New Approach to the Design of a Digital Computer (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.umn.edu/cbi/oh/pdf.phtml?id=21] The Burroughs B5000 Conference (1985) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OH"/&gt; where he found a reference to [[Polish notation]],&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;[http://purl.umn.edu/107105 "Oral History: Burroughs B5000 Conference"], OH 98.

This calculator popularized reverse Polish notation among the scientific and engineering communities.

By this time, HP was the leading manufacturer of calculators for professionals, including engineers and accountants.

Later LCD-based calculators in the early 1980s such as the [[HP-10C]], [[HP-11C]], [[HP-15C]], [[HP-16C]], and the financial calculator, the [[HP-12C]] also used reverse Polish notation. In 1988, Hewlett-Packard introduced a business calculator, the [[HP-19B]], without reverse Polish notation, but its 1990 successor, the [[HP-19BII]], gave users the option of using algebraic notation or reverse Polish notation.

{{anchor|Automatic Memory Stack}}Around 1987, HP introduced [[RPL (programming language)|RPL]], an object-oriented successor to reverse Polish notation. It deviates from classical reverse Polish notation by utilizing a stack only limited by the amount of available memory (instead of three or four fixed levels) and which can hold all kinds of data objects (including symbols, strings, lists, matrices, graphics, programs, etc.) instead of just numbers. It also changed the behaviour of the stack to no longer duplicate the top register on drops (since in an unlimited stack there is no longer a top register) and the behaviour of the {{key press|Enter}} key so that it no longer duplicates values into Y under certain conditions, both part of the specific ruleset of the so-called ''automatic memory stack''&lt;ref name="HP42_OM"&gt;{{cite book |title=HP-42S RPN Scientific Calculator – Owner's Manual |date=June 1988 |edition=1 |id=00042-90001 |location=Corvallis, OR, USA |publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard Co.]] |page=3 |url=http://www.hp41.net/forum/fileshp41net/manuel-hp42s-us.pdf |access-date=2017-09-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917215457/http://www.hp41.net/forum/fileshp41net/manuel-hp42s-us.pdf |archive-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''operational (memory) stack''&lt;ref name="HP35"&gt;{{cite book |title=HP35 User's Manual |publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]] |page=i |quote=[…] The operational stack and reverse Polish (Łukasiewicz) notation used in the HP-35 are the most efficient way known to computer science for evaluating mathematical expressions.

From 1990 to 2003 HP manufactured the [[HP-48 series]] of graphing RPL calculators and in 2006 introduced the [[HP 50g]].

As of 2011, Hewlett-Packard was offering the calculator models [[HP-12C|12C]], [[HP-12C|12C Platinum]], [[HP 17bII+|17bII+]], [[HP 20b|20b]], [[HP 30b|30b]], [[HP 33s|33s]], [[HP 35s|35s]], [[HP 48gII|48gII]] (RPL) and [[HP 50g|50g]] (RPL) which support reverse Polish notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/calculators/index.html HP Calculators]&lt;/ref&gt; While calculators emulating classical models continue to support classical reverse Polish notation, new reverse Polish notation models feature a variant of reverse Polish notation, where the {{key press|Enter}} key behaves as in RPL. This latter variant is sometimes known as ''entry RPN''.&lt;ref&gt;http://h20331.www2.hp.com/hpsub/downloads/S07%20HP%20RPN%20Evolves%20V5b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[HP Prime]] introduced a ''128-level'' form of entry RPN called ''advanced RPN''.

Gaudí's work on the building is part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; and in November 2010 [[Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] consecrated and proclaimed it a [[minor basilica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexander |last=Drummer |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |title=Pontiff to Proclaim Gaudí's Church a Basilica |publisher=ZENIT |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925095015/http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |title=The Pope Consecrates The Church of the Sagrada Familia |publisher=Vatican Information Service |location=[[Vatican City]] |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uAAUTwy8?url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |archivedate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNSvisit"&gt;{{cite web |date=4 March 2010 |title=Pope to visit Santiago de Compostela, Barcelona in November |author=Delaney, Sarah |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100407164905/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct from a [[cathedral]], which must be the seat of a bishop.

In 1882, construction of Sagrada Família started under architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar]]. In 1883, when Villar resigned,&lt;ref name= UNESCO/&gt; Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and curvilinear [[Art Nouveau]] forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, when he was run down by a streetcar, less than a quarter of the project was complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]], only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Since commencing construction in 1882, advancements in technologies such as [[computer aided design]] and computerised [[numerical control]] (CNC) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important [[List of major biblical figures|Biblical figure]] in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026—the centenary of Gaudí's death. 

The basilica has a long history of dividing the citizens of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia|Barcelona's cathedral]], over Gaudí's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaudí's death disregarded his design,&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; and the 2007 proposal to build an underground tunnel of Spain's [[AVE|high-speed rail]] link to France which could disturb its stability.&lt;ref name="nyt4"&gt;{{cite news| title = Warning: Trains Coming.

After a visit to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by [[Basilica della Santa Casa|the basilica]] at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]].&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano|Francisco de Paula del Villar]], whose plan was for a [[Gothic revival]] church of a standard form.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Gaudí assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; Antoni Gaudí began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.

===Construction===
[[File:Sagrada familia construction differences.jpg|thumb|New stonework at the Sagrada Família is clearly visible against the stained and weathered older sections.]]
On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudí is said to have remarked: "My client is not in a hurry."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When Gaudí died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news | title = ARCHITECTURE: Gaudí's Unfinished Masterpiece Is Virtually Complete | journal=The New York Times|first=Valerie|last= Gladstone|date= 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/arts/architecture-gaudi-s-unfinished-masterpiece-is-virtually-complete.html?scp=10&amp;sq=gaudi%20sagrada%20familia&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gaudí's death, work continued under the direction of [[Domènec Sugrañes i Gras]] until interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936.

Parts of the unfinished basilica and Gaudí's models and workshop were destroyed during the war by [[Anarchist Catalonia|Catalan anarchists]]. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940 the architects Francesc Quintana, [[Isidre Puig Boada]], Lluís Bonet i Gari and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by [[Carles Buïgas]].
The current director and son of Lluís Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol, has been introducing computers into the design and construction process since the 1980s. [[Mark Burry]] of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by [[J. Busquets]], [[Etsuro Sotoo]] and the controversial [[Josep Maria Subirachs]] decorate the fantastical façades. Barcelona-born Jordi Fauli took over as chief architect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Completion Date for Sagrada Família, Helped by Technology|url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/a-completion-date-for-sagrada-familia-helped-by-technology_o|website = Architect|accessdate = 9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[nave]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the [[transept]] vaults and [[apse]]. {{As of|2006}}, work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main tower of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory façade.

The church shares its site with the [[Sagrada Família Schools]] building, a school originally designed by Gaudí in 1909 for the children of the construction workers. Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Chief architect Jordi Fauli announced in October 2015 that construction is 70 percent complete and has entered its final phase of raising six immense towers. The towers and most of the church's structure are to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaudí's death; decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032. Visitor entrance fees of 15–20 euros finance the annual construction budget of 25{{nbsp}}million euros .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barcelona's La Sagrada Familia Basilica enters final years of construction|url = http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/22/barcelonas-la-sagrada-familia-basilica-enters-final-years-of-construction|website = Toronto Sun|accessdate = 9 November 2015|first = Joseph|last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CAD/CAM|Computer-aided design]] technology has been used to accelerate construction of the building.

===AVE tunnel===
Since 2013, [[AVE]] high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Família through an underground tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona.

The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (''Ministerio de Fomento'') claimed the project posed no risk to the church.&lt;ref name="tbm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADIF (Administrator of Railway Infrastructures)|title=Madrid&amp;nbsp;– Zaragoza Barcelona&amp;nbsp;– French Border Line Barcelona Sants-Sagrera&amp;nbsp;– high-speed tunnel|url=http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621024109/http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|archivedate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagrada Família engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Família (''Patronat de la Sagrada Família'') and the neighborhood association ''AVE pel Litoral'' (AVE by the Coast) had led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In October 2010, the [[tunnel boring machine]] reached the church underground under the location of the building's principal façade.&lt;ref name="tbm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=La tuneladora del AVE perfora ya a cuatro metros de la Sagrada Família |trans-title=The tunnel boring machine of the AVE is already excavating four meters from the Sagrada Família |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/20101013/sagrada-familia-pasa-primer-test-del-ave/530676.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=13 October 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013.&lt;ref name="AVEopen"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/ave-alcanza-girona-2288906| title= El AVE alcanza Girona| accessdate=8 January 2013| date= 8 January 2013| newspaper= [[El Periódico de Catalunya]]| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by [[Edilon Sedra]] in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations.&lt;ref name="Periodico_2012-03-11A"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=Doble aislante de vibraciones en las obras de Gaudí|trans-title=Double Isolation of Vibrations at the Gaudí constructions|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/doble-aislante-vibraciones-las-obras-gaudi-1526442|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=12 March 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; No damage to the Sagrada Família has been reported to date.

Accessed September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Σαγράδα Φαμίλια 2941.jpg|thumb|right|East view, with the Nativity façade (2017)]]

The style of la Sagrada Família is variously likened to [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish Late Gothic]], [[Catalan Modernism]] and to [[Art Nouveau]] or Catalan [[Noucentisme]]. While the Sagrada Família falls within the Art Nouveau period, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] points out that, along with [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, Gaudí carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.&lt;ref name=Pevsner/&gt;

===Plan===
While never intended to be a [[cathedral]] (seat of a bishop), the Sagrada Família was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as [[Burgos Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]] and [[Seville Cathedral]]. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Família is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an [[ambulatory]] with a [[chevet]] of seven [[apsidal]] chapels, a multitude of towers and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or [[cloister]] which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the [[narthex]] of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaudí's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  There are no exact [[right angle]]s to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|last2=Handy|first2=Amy|title=The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdiFhC6XOWwC|accessdate=26 October 2018|volume=2|date=11 April 2001|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740710247|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudí|first1=Antoni |last2=Cuito|first2=Aurora |last3=Montes|first3=Cristina |title=Gaudí|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f90NukJl5cIC|accessdate=26 October 2018|year=2002|publisher=A. Asppan S.L|isbn=9788489439917|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spires===
Gaudí's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the [[Twelve Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;Note: the two Apostles who are also Evangelists are left out and replaced by St. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and also St. [[Barnabas]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], the [[four Evangelists]] and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Eight spires have been built {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity façade and four apostles at the Passion façade.

According to the 2005 "Works Report" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaudí and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaudí to be shorter than those of the evangelists. The spire height will follow Gaudí's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} 

The Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull ([[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]]), a winged man ([[Matthew the Apostle|Saint Matthew]]), an eagle ([[John the Evangelist|Saint John]]), and a winged lion ([[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant [[Christian cross|cross]]; its total height ({{convert|170|m|ft}}) will be one metre less than that of [[Montjuïc]] hill in Barcelona as Gaudí believed that his creation should not surpass God's. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the [[Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaudí performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Álvaro Muñoz |first1=Mari Carmen |last2=Llop i Bayo |first2=Francesc |title=Tubular bell |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/catedral.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only one bell is currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventario de campanas de las Catedrales de España |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/cat_campanes1.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Família the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church building in the world]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Façades===
[[File:TTTT6.JPG|thumb|right|The Nativity façade]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The Church will have three grand façades: the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] façade to the East, the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] façade to the West, and the [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] façade to the South (yet to be completed). The Nativity Façade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaudí influence. The Passion façade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the towers, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. These controversial designs are the work of [[Josep Maria Subirachs]]. The Glory façade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the [[Seven deadly sins]] and the [[Seven heavenly virtues]].

====Nativity Façade====
[[File:Die Geburtsfassade der Sagrada Familia im Detail.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the choir of angel children]]

Constructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity façade was the first façade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaudí's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the façade, and are symbolic of change.

The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The [[Tree of Life]] rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four towers complete the façade and are each dedicated to a Saint ([[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], [[Barnabas]], [[Jude the Apostle]], and [[Simon the Zealot]]).

Originally, Gaudí intended for this façade to be [[polychrome]]d, for each [[archivolt]] to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergós i Massó | first = Joan | title = Gaudí, l'home i l'obra | year = 1999 | publisher=Ed. Lunwerg |place= Barcelona | isbn= 84-7782-617-X |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudí chose this façade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this façade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Façade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Façade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barral i Altet | first = Xavier | title = Art de Catalunya.

====Passion Façade====
[[File:SF - Passió 2018-m.jpg|thumb|right|Passion façade of the Sagrada Família in 2018]]
In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his [[crucifixion]], the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudí for future architects and sculptors. The towers were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the façade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to "break" arcs and "cut" columns, and to use the effect of [[chiaroscuro]] (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.

Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] trunks. Above there is a pyramidal [[pediment]], made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four towers is dedicated to an apostle ([[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]) and, like the Nativity Façade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.

The scenes sculpted into the façade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an ''S'' form and reproduce the stations of the Cross ([[Via Crucis]] of Christ).&lt;ref name="gimeno"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gómez Gimeno | first = María José | title = La Sagrada Família | year = 2006 | publisher=Mundo Flip Ediciones | isbn = 84-933983-4-9 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the [[Last Supper]], [[Kiss of Judas]], [[Ecce homo]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]]. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes [[The Three Marys]], Saint [[Longinus]], [[Saint Veronica]], and a [[hollow-face illusion]] of Christ on the [[Veil of Veronica]]. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the [[Resurrection of Christ]] can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the towers of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html |title=La Sagrada Familia abrirá al culto en 2008, según sus responsables |trans-title=The Sagrada Familia opens for worship in 2008, according to its leaders |date=2 June 2005 | agency=Europa Press |language=Spanish| publisher=Mundinteractivos, SA |work=El Mundo| accessdate=7 July 2010 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The largest and most striking of the façades will be the Glory Façade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal façade and will offer access to the central [[nave]]. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while [[Hell]] is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this façade completed, Gaudí made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the façade. The completion of this façade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.barcelonas.com/future-of-la-sagrada-familia.html&lt;/ref&gt;


To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA012c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], and at the top, The [[Seven Heavenly Virtues|Seven Virtues]].
*'''Gifts''': wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.
*'''Sins''': greed, anger, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy.
*'''Virtues''': kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity.
[[File:Puerta Gloria.jpg|thumb|right|Eucharist Door of the Glory Facade showing, at bottom, the "A...G" for Anoni Gaudí]]
This facade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Façade a total seven doors representing the sacraments:

*[[Baptism]]
*[[Confirmation]]
*[[Eucharist]]
*[[Penance]]
*[[Holy orders]]
*[[Marriage]]
*[[Unction of the sick]]

In September 2008, the doors of the Glory façade, by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], were installed.  Inscribed with the [[Lord's prayer]], these central doors are inscribed with the words "Give us our daily bread" in fifty different languages.  The handles of the door are the letters "A" and "G" that form the initials of Antoni Gaudí within the phrase "lead us not into temptation".

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5{{nbsp}}metre (25&amp;nbsp;ft) grid. However, the columns of the [[apse]], resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. Gaudí intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.

There are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.

The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).

Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.

====Organ====
In 2010 an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.

To overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.&lt;ref&gt;Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, [http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903070257/http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }} {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric details===
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:AlphaOmega.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alpha and Omega]] carving at Sagrada Família entrance]]

The towers on the Nativity façade are crowned with [[Mathematics and art|geometrically shaped]] tops that are reminiscent of [[Cubism]] (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of [[Art Nouveau]], but Gaudí's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.

Gaudí used [[hyperboloid structure]]s in later designs of the Sagrada Família (more obviously after 1914), however there are a few places on the nativity façade—a design not equated with Gaudí's [[ruled surface|ruled-surface]] design—where the [[hyperboloid]] crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the "bishop's mitre" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures.&lt;ref name=BDM&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. C. |last1=Burry |first2=J. R. |last2=Burry |first3=G.

===Symbolism===
[[File:SagradaFamiliaSanctus.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a tower of the Passion Façade decorated with the word [[Sanctus]]]]
Themes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The towers are decorated with words such as "Hosanna", "Excelsis", and "Sanctus"; the great doors of the Passion façade reproduce excerpts of the [[Passion of Jesus]] from the New Testament in various languages, mainly [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; and the Glory façade is to be decorated with the words from the [[Apostles' Creed]], while its main door reproduce the entire [[Lord's Prayer]] in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of "Give us this day our daily bread" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Façade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory façade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion façade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse tower bears Latin text of [[Hail Mary]]. All in all, the Sagrada Família is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.

Areas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.

===Burials===
*Josep Maria Bocabella
*[[Antoni Gaudí]]

==Appraisal==
The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaudí's buildings as growing "like [[Sugarloaf|sugar loaves]] and anthills" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly "bad taste" but handled with vitality and "ruthless audacity".&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaudí's fellow architects were generally
positive; [[Louis Sullivan]] greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Família as the
"greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised
in stone!"&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;[[David Mower]], ''Gaudí'', Oresko Books Limited, 1977, (p.6) {{ISBN|0905368096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Gropius]] also praised the Sagrada Família, describing the building's walls as "a marvel of
technical perfection".&lt;ref name="dm" /&gt;
[[Time Magazine]] called it "sensual, spiritual, whimsical, exuberant",&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news

===World Heritage status===
Together with six other Gaudí buildings in Barcelona, part of la Sagrada Família is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], as testifying "to Gaudí's exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology", "having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia" and "anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century". The inscription only includes the Crypt and the Nativity Façade.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 Works of Antoni Gaudí]'', UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting==
Visitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity towers. Entrance to either of the towers requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the towers to the bridge between the towers. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.

As of June 2017, on-line ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] kiosks (part of "La Caixa") or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |website=Basílica de la Sagrada Família |title=Tickets |access-date=8 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608050100/http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |archive-date=8 June 2017 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the peak season, May to October, reservation delays for entrance of up to a few days are not unusual.

==Funding and Building permit==
Construction on Sagrada Família is not supported by any government or official church sources. Private patrons funded the initial stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essential-architecture.com/SPAIN/SP-BA/BA-006.htm |title= Sagrada Família Church of the Holy Family |work=Essential Architecture| author=Fletcher, Tom |accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money from tickets purchased by tourists is now used to pay for the work, and private donations are accepted through the Friends of the Sagrada Família.

The construction budget for 2009 was €18&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="elpais"/&gt;

In October 2018, Sagrada Família trustees agreed to pay €36&amp;nbsp;million in payments to the city authorities, to land a building permit after 136 years of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/la-sagrada-familia-building-permit/56929/|title=136 years late, La Sagrada Familia finally lands a building permit|work=New Atlas|date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds would be directed to improve the access between the church and [[Barcelona metro|Barcelona's metro]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5429231/barcelona-sagrada-familia-building-permit/|title=Barcelona's Sagrada Familia Church Has Been Under Construction for 136 Years.

In [[set theory]] and its applications to [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]], '''set-builder notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by enumerating its elements or stating the properties that its members must satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosen| first=Kenneth| year=2007 | title=Discrete Mathematics and its Applications | edition=6th | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York, NY | isbn=978-0-07-288008-3| pages=111–112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining sets by properties is also known as '''set comprehension''', '''set abstraction''' or as defining a set's '''[[intension]]'''.

Set-builder notation is sometimes simply referred to as ''set notation'', although this phrase may be better reserved for [[set notation|the broader class of means of denoting sets]].

== Sets defined by enumeration ==

A [[set (mathematics)|set]] is an  unordered collection of ''elements''.  (An ''element'' may also be referred to as a ''member''.)  An element may be any mathematical entity.

A set can be described directly by enumerating all of its elements between curly brackets, as in the following two examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 7, 3, 15, 31\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set holding the four numbers 3, 7, 15, and 31.
* &lt;math&gt;\{a, c, b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set containing 'a','b', and 'c'.

This is sometimes called the "roster method" for specifying a set.&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Aufmann, Vernon C. Barker, and Joanne Lockwood, 2007, ''Intermediate Algebra with Applications'', Brooks Cole, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is desired to denote a set that contains elements from a regular sequence an [[ellipsis|ellipses]] notation may be employed, as shown in the next examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;\{\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}= \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers.

There is no order among the elements of a set (this explains and validates the equality of the last example), but with the ellipses notation we show an ordered sequence before (or after) the ellipsis as a convenient notational vehicle for explaining to a reader which elements are in a set.  The first few elements of the sequence are shown then the ellipses indicate that the simplest interpretation should be applied for continuing the sequence. Should no terminating value appear to the right of the ellipses then the sequence is considered to be unbounded.

In each preceding example, each set is described by enumerating its elements. Not all sets can be described in this way, or if they can, their enumeration may be too long or too complicated to be useful. Therefore, many sets are defined by a property that characterizes their elements. This characterization may be done informally using general prose, as in the following example.

* &lt;math&gt;\{&lt;/math&gt; addresses on Pine Street &lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all addresses on Pine Street.

However, the prose approach may lack accuracy or be ambiguous. Thus, set builder notation is often used with a predicate characterizing the elements of the set being defined, as described in the following section.

== Sets defined by a predicate ==
Set builder notation can be used to describe sets that are defined by a predicate, rather than explicitly enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Cullinan, 2012, ''A Transition to Mathematics with Proofs'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, pp.&amp;nbsp;44ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, set builder notation has three parts: a variable, a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] or [[vertical bar]] separator, and a logical [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]. Thus there is a variable on the left of the separator, and a rule on the right of it. These three parts are contained in curly brackets:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The vertical bar, which can also be written as a colon, is a separator that can be read as "'''such that'''", &lt;!--bold, because "such that" redirects here--&gt; "for which", or "with the property that".  The formula {{math|&amp;Phi;(''x'')}} is said to be the ''rule'' or the ''predicate''.   All values of ''x'' for which the predicate holds (is true) belong to the set being defined. All values of {{math|''x''}} for which the predicate does not hold do not belong to the set.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that satisfy the formula {{math|&amp;Phi;}}. It may be the [[empty set]], if no value of {{math|''x''}} satisfies the formula.

=== Specifying the domain ===

A [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] {{math|''E''}} can appear on the left of the vertical bar: 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in E  \mid  \Phi(x)\},&lt;/math&gt; 
or by adjoining it to the predicate:
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid x \in E \text{ and } \Phi(x)\}\quad\text{or}\quad\{ x \mid x \in E \land \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The &amp;isin; symbol here denotes [[set membership]], while the &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; symbol denotes the logical "and" operator, known as [[logical conjunction]]. This notation represents the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that belong to some given set {{math|''E''}} for which the predicate is true. (see "[[#Set existence axiom|Set existence axiom]]" below)

In general, it is not a good idea to consider sets without defining a domain, as this would represent the subset of ''all possible things that may exist'' for which the predicate is true. This can easily lead to contradictions and paradoxes. For example, [[Russell's paradox]] shows that the expression &lt;math&gt;\{x ~|~ x\not\in x\},&lt;/math&gt; although seemingly well formed as a set builder expression, can not define a set without producing a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Andrew David | last1=Irvine | first2=Harry | last2=Deutsch | orig-year=1995 | date=9 October 2016 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ | title=Russell's Paradox | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the set ''E'' is clear from context, it may be not explicitly specified.  It is common in the literature for an author to state the domain ahead of time, and then not specify it in the set builder notation. For example, an author may say something such as, "Unless otherwise stated, variables are to be taken to be natural numbers."

=== Examples ===
The following examples illustrate particular sets defined by set builder notation via predicates. In each case, the domain is specified on the left side of the vertical bar, while the rule is specified on the right side. 
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}   \mid  x &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all strictly [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]]s, which can be written in interval notation as &lt;math&gt;(0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}  \mid |x| = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set can also be defined as &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;; see [[#Equivalent predicates yield equal sets|equivalent predicates yield equal sets]] below.
* For each integer ''m'',  we can define &lt;math&gt;G_m = \{x  \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid  x \ge m \} = \{ m, m + 1, m + 2, \ldots\},&lt;/math&gt;. As an example, &lt;math&gt;G_3 = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \ge 3 \} = \{ 3, 4, 5, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_{-2} = \{ -2, -1, 0, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid 0 &lt; y &lt; f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;  is the set of pairs of real numbers such that ''y'' is greater than 0 and less than ''f''(''x''), for a given [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''.   Here the [[cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of ordered pairs of real numbers. 
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{n   \in \mathbb{N} \mid  (\exists k)  [k\in \mathbb{N}\land n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[even number|even]] [[natural number]]s. The &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; sign stands for "and", which is known as [[logical conjunction]].    The &amp;exist; sign stands for "there exists", which is known as [[existential quantification]].   So for example, &lt;math&gt; (\exists x) P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is read as  'there exists an ''x'' such that ''P''(''x'')".
&lt;!-- --&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;\{n \mid  (\exists k \in \mathbb{N} )  [n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is a notational variant for the same set of even natural numbers. It is not necessary to specify that {{math|''n''}} is a natural number, as this is implied by the formula on the right.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{a \in \mathbb{R} \mid (\exists p\in \mathbb{Z} )(\exists q\in \mathbb{Z} )[ q \not = 0 \land aq=p] \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s; that is, real numbers that can be written as the ratio of two [[integer]]s.

== More complex expressions on the left side of the notation ==

An extension of set-builder notation replaces the single variable {{math|''x''}} with a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] that may include one or more variables, combined with functions acting on them. So instead of  &lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;, we may have &lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\},&lt;/math&gt; which should be read
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}=\{y\mid\exists (x_1, \ldots, x_n), y=\Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\text{ and }\Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:
* &lt;math&gt;\{2 n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all natural numbers, is the set of all even natural numbers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{p/q  \mid p,q \in \mathbb Z, q \not = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers, is the set of all rational numbers ({{math|'''Q'''}}).
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of odd integers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (t, 2 t + 1) \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;  creates a set of pairs, where each pair puts an integer into correspondence with an odd integer.

When inverse functions can be explicitly stated, the expression on the left can be eliminated through simple substitution.  Consider the example set &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;. Make the substitution &lt;math&gt;u = 2t + 1&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say &lt;math&gt; t = (u-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, then replace ''t'' in the set builder notation to find 
:&lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\} = \{ u \mid  (u- 1)/2 \in  \mathbb Z\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Equivalent predicates yield equal sets ==

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Sets defined by set builder notation are equal if and only if their set builder rules, including the domain specifiers, are equivalent. That is 
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in A \mid P(x) \}=\{ x \in B \mid Q(x) \} &lt;/math&gt; 
if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt; (\forall t)[ (t \in A \land P(t)) \Leftrightarrow (t \in B \land Q(t))]&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, in order to prove the equality of two sets defined by set builder notation, it suffices to prove the equivalence of their predicates, including the domain qualifiers.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \mathbb{R}\mid  x^2 = 1 \} = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid |x| = 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
because the two rule predicates are logically equivalent:
:&lt;math&gt; (x \in \mathbb{R} \land x^2 = 1) \Leftrightarrow (x \in \mathbb{Q} \land |x| = 1).&lt;/math&gt;
This equivalence holds because, for any real number ''x'', we have &lt;math&gt;x^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''x'' is a rational number with &lt;math&gt;|x|=1&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, both sets are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Set existence axiom ==

In many formal set theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], set builder notation is not part of the formal syntax of the theory. Instead, there is a [[axiom of comprehension|set existence axiom scheme]], which states that if ''E'' is a set and Φ(x) is a formula in the language of set theory, then there is a set ''Y'' whose members are exactly the elements of ''E'' that satisfy Φ:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall E)(\exists Y)(\forall x)[x \in Y \Leftrightarrow x \in E \land \Phi(x)].&lt;/math&gt;
The set ''Y'' obtained from this axiom is exactly the set described in set builder notation as &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in E \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Z notation ==
{{Main article|Z notation}}
In [[Z notation]], the set of all ''x'' in a universe of discourse ''A'' that satisfy the condition ''P''(''x'') is written
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In Z, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] of an element ''x'' in set ''A'' is written as &lt;math&gt;(x : A)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;(x \in A)&lt;/math&gt;. Versions of set builder notation are also available in Z which allow for terms more complicated than a single variable, using a bullet to indicate the form of members of the set. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x) \bullet F(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; 
denotes the set of all values ''F''(''x''), where ''x'' is in ''A'' and ''P''(''x'') holds.

== Parallels in programming languages ==
{{main article|List comprehension}}
A similar notation available in a number of [[programming languages]] (notably [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is the [[list comprehension]], which combines [[map (higher-order function)|map]] and [[filter (higher-order function)|filter]] operations over one or more [[list (computing)|lists]].

In Python, the set-builder's braces are replaced with square brackets, parentheses, or curly braces, giving list, [[generator (computer science)|generator]], and set objects, respectively. Python uses an English-based syntax. Haskell replaces the set-builder's braces with square brackets and uses symbols, including the standard set-builder vertical bar.

The same can be achieved in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] using Sequence Comprehensions, where the "for" keyword returns a list of the yielded variables using the "yield" keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Scala | url=http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/sequence-comprehensions.html | title=Sequence Comprehensions | accessdate=6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider these set-builder notation examples in some programming languages:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Example 1 !! Example 2
|-
! Set-builder
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{l\ |\ l \in L\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  || &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{(k, x)\ |\ k \in K \wedge x \in X \wedge P(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
| &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{l for l in L}&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{(k, x) for k in K for x in X if P(x)}&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]
| &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[l | l &lt;- ls]&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[(k, x) | k &lt;- ks, x &lt;- xs, p x]&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]
| &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (l &lt;- L) yield l&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (k &lt;- K; x &lt;- X if P(x)) yield (k,x)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[SQL]]
| &lt;source lang="sql"&gt;SELECT l FROM L_set&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="sql"&gt; SELECT k, x FROM K_set, X_set WHERE P(x)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The set builder notation and list comprehension notation are both instances of a more general notation known as ''monad comprehensions'', which permits map/filter-like operations over any [[monad (functional programming)|monad]] with a [[zero element]].

In [[control engineering]], a '''state-space representation''' is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s. State variables are variables whose values evolve through time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and also depends on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables’ values depend on the values of the state variables.

The "[[state space]]" is the [[Euclidean space]] in which the variables on the axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space.

To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, these variables are expressed as [[row and column vectors|vectors]]. Additionally, if the [[dynamical system]] is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and [[algebraic equation]]s may be written in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form.&lt;ref&gt;

The state-space method is characterized by significant algebraization of general [[system theory]], which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with modulation or without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13866/modelirovanie_dinamicheskih_sistem_s_modulyacieys_ispolzovaniem_kronekerovskih_vektorno-matrichnyhpredstavleniy.htm|title=Modeling of dynamic systems with modulation by means of Kronecker vector-matrix representation.|author1=Vasilyev A.S. |author2=Ushakov A.V. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=839–848.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;         
The state-space representation (also known as the "[[time-domain]] approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs, we would otherwise have to write down &lt;math&gt;q \times p&lt;/math&gt; [[Laplace transform]]s to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the [[frequency domain]] approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. The state-space model is used in many different areas. In [[econometrics]], the state-space model can be used for forecasting [[stock price]]s&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li,Kwong Wing Chau (2016) Econometric Analyses of International Housing Markets, Routledge, https://books.google.com.hk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xyneCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Rita+yi+man+li%22&amp;ots=7YTLXxGi5z&amp;sig=1j-NKyZu1yGUbzUv_O84z2bysTc&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rita%20yi%20man%20li%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other variables.

== State variables ==

The internal [[state variable]]s are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nise |first1=Norman S. |year=2010 |title=Control Systems Engineering |edition=6th |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-470-54756-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information about the system, and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables or the system will not be able to be solved.

== Linear systems ==

[[Image:Typical State Space model.png|framed|Block diagram representation of the linear state-space equations]]

The most general state-space representation of a linear system with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; state variables is written in the following form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brogan |first1=William L. |year=1974 |title=Modern Control Theory |edition=1st |publisher=Quantum Publishers, Inc. |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + B(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + D(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "state vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "output vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "input (or control) vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;A(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "state (or system) matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[A(\cdot)] = n \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "input matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[B(\cdot)] = n \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "output matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[C(\cdot)] = q \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix" (in cases where the system model does not have a direct feedthrough, &lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the zero matrix),&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[D(\cdot)] = q \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) := \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In this general formulation, all matrices are allowed to be time-variant (i.e. their elements can depend on time); however, in the common [[LTI system|LTI]] case, matrices will be time invariant. The time variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be continuous (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) or discrete (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;). In the latter case, the time variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is usually used instead of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. [[Hybrid system]]s allow for time domains that have both continuous and discrete parts. Depending on the assumptions taken, the state-space model representation can assume the following forms:
{| cellpadding="4"
|- valign="top"
|'''System type''' || '''State-space model'''
|- valign="top"
|Continuous time-invariant || &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign="top"
|Continuous time-variant || &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{A}(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B}(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{C}(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{D}(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign="top"

=== Example: continuous-time LTI case ===

Stability and natural response characteristics of a continuous-time [[LTI system]] (i.e., linear with matrices that are constant with respect to time) can be studied from the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''A'''.  The stability of a time-invariant state-space model can be determined by looking at the system's [[transfer function]] in factored form. It will then look something like this:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = k \frac{ (s - z_{1})(s - z_{2})(s - z_{3})
                              }{ (s - p_{1})(s - p_{2})(s - p_{3})(s - p_{4})
                                }. &lt;/math&gt;

The denominator of the transfer function is equal to the [[characteristic polynomial]] found by taking the [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;sI - A&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\lambda}(s) = |sI - A|. &lt;/math&gt;
The roots of this polynomial (the [[eigenvalue]]s) are the system transfer function's [[complex pole|pole]]s (i.e., the [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] where the transfer function's magnitude is unbounded). These poles can be used to analyze whether the system is [[exponential stability|asymptotically stable]] or [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system's [[Lyapunov stability]].

The zeros found in the numerator of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; can similarly be used to determine whether the system is [[minimum phase]].

The system may still be '''input&amp;ndash;output stable''' (see [[BIBO stability|BIBO stable]]) even though it is not internally stable. This may be the case if unstable poles are canceled out by zeros (i.e., if those singularities in the transfer function are [[removable singularity|removable]]).

=== Controllability ===
{{Main| Controllability}}

The state controllability condition implies that it is possible&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; by admissible inputs&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to steer the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time window. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''controllable''' [[iff|if and only if]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}B&amp; AB&amp; A^{2}B&amp; \dots &amp; A^{n-1}B\end{bmatrix} = n, &lt;/math&gt;
where [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] is the number of linearly independent rows in a matrix, and where ''n'' is the number of state variables.

=== Observability ===
{{Main| Observability}}

Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).

A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''observable''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}C\\ CA\\ \vdots\\ CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix} = n. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Transfer function ===

The "[[transfer function]]" of a continuous time-invariant linear state-space model can be derived in the following way:

First, taking the [[Laplace transform]] of 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  
yields
:&lt;math&gt;s\mathbf{X}(s)-\mathbf{x}(0) = A \mathbf{X}(s) + B \mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;
Next, we simplify for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:&lt;math&gt;(s\mathbf{I} - A)\mathbf{X}(s) =\mathbf{x}(0)+ B\mathbf{U}(s), &lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s) =(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the output equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C\mathbf{X}(s) + D\mathbf{U}(s),&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C((s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s)) + D\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

The [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the output to the input of a system considering its initial conditions to be zero (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0) =\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;). However, the ratio of a vector to a vector does not exist, so we consider the following condition satisfied by the transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)\times\mathbf{U}(s) = \mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt;
comparison with the equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt; above gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s) = C(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B + D. &lt;/math&gt;
Clearly &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; dimensionality, and thus has a total of &lt;math&gt;qp&lt;/math&gt; elements.
So for every input there are &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; transfer functions with one for each output.
This is why the state-space representation can easily be the preferred choice for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The [[Rosenbrock system matrix]] provides a bridge between the state-space representation and its [[transfer function]].

=== Canonical realizations ===
{{main|Realization (systems)}}

Any given transfer function which is [[strictly proper]] can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system):

Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                                0&amp;      1&amp;      0&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      1&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      0&amp;      1\\
                               -d_{4}&amp; -d_{3}&amp; -d_{2}&amp; -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}&amp; n_{3}&amp; n_{2}&amp; n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''controllable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).


The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp;  -d_{4}\\
                               1&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp; -d_{3}\\
                               0&amp;   1&amp;  0&amp; -d_{2}\\
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  1&amp;  -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}\\ n_{3}\\ n_{2}\\ n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''observable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).

=== Proper transfer functions ===

Transfer functions which are only [[proper transfer function|proper]] (and not [[strictly proper]]) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant. 
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \textbf{G}_\mathrm{SP}(s) + \textbf{G}(\infty). &lt;/math&gt;

The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially &lt;math&gt;\textbf{y}(t) = \textbf{G}(\infty)\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix ''D'' determined by the constant.

Here is an example to clear things up a bit:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{s^{2} + 3s + 3}{s^{2} + 2s + 1}
                      = \frac{s + 2}{s^{2} + 2s + 1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;
which yields the following controllable realization
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               -2&amp; -1\\
                                1&amp;      0\\
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp; 2\end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 1\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; constant in the transfer function.

=== Feedback ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback.png|framed|Typical state-space model with feedback]]

A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix ''K'' and setting this as the input to the system: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the values of ''K'' are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for [[negative feedback]].
The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this is that the [[eigenvalues]] of ''A'' can be controlled by setting ''K'' appropriately through eigendecomposition of &lt;math&gt;\left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
This assumes that the closed-loop system is [[controllability|controllable]] or that the unstable eigenvalues of ''A'' can be made stable through appropriate choice of ''K''.

==== Example ====
For a strictly proper system ''D'' equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. ''y'' = ''x'', which yields ''C'' = ''I'', the [[Identity matrix]]. This would then result in the simpler equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just &lt;math&gt;A + B K&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Feedback with setpoint (reference) input ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback and input.png|framed|Output feedback with set point]]

In addition to feedback, an input, &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, can be added such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = -K \mathbf{y}(t) + \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) - B K \mathbf{y}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) - D K \mathbf{y}(t) + D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation 
results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \left(I -  K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1}D \right) \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t) + \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

One fairly common simplification to this system is removing ''D'', which reduces the equations to

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Moving object example ===
A classical linear system is that of one-dimensional movement of an object.
[[Newton's laws of motion]] for an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{y}(t) = u(t) - b\dot{y}(t) - k y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is position; &lt;math&gt;\dot y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is velocity; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an applied force
*&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the viscous friction coefficient
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring constant
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object

The state equation would then become

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{\dot{x}_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{\dot{x}_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] + \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the position of the object
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = \ddot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object
*the output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the object

The [[controllability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} B &amp; AB \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] &amp; \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right]   \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; \frac{1}{m} \\ \frac{1}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m^2} \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which has full rank for all &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[observability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} C \\ CA \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \\ \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which also has full rank.
Therefore, this system is both controllable and observable.

== Nonlinear systems ==
The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{h}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;

The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation.
If the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above.
The &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs).

=== Pendulum example ===
A classic nonlinear system is a simple unforced [[pendulum]]

:&lt;math&gt;m\ell^2\ddot\theta(t)= - m\ell g\sin\theta(t) - k\ell\dot\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum with respect to the direction of gravity
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum (pendulum rod's mass is assumed to be zero)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is coefficient of friction at the pivot point
*&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the pendulum (to the center of gravity of the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;)
The state equations are then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = \theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational velocity of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2 = \ddot{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational acceleration of the pendulum

Instead, the state equation can be written in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left( \begin{matrix} \dot{x}_1(t) \\ \dot{x}_2(t) \end{matrix} \right) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t)) = \left( \begin{matrix} x_2(t) \\  - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]/[[stationary point]]s of a system are when &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and so the equilibrium points of a pendulum are those that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} n\pi \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integers ''n''.

'''Stratification''' has several usages in mathematics.

==In mathematical logic==
In [[mathematical logic]], '''stratification''' is any consistent assignment of numbers to [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] symbols guaranteeing that a unique formal [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a logical theory exists. Specifically, we say that a set of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]] of the form &lt;math&gt;Q_1 \wedge \dots \wedge Q_n \wedge \neg Q_{n+1} \wedge \dots \wedge \neg Q_{n+m} \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; is stratified if and only if
there is a stratification assignment S that fulfills the following conditions:

# If a predicate P is positively derived from a predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs positively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than or equal to the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) \geq S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.
# If a predicate P is derived from a negated predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs negatively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) &gt; S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of stratified negation leads to a very effective operational semantics for stratified programs in terms of the stratified least fixpoint, that is obtained by iteratively applying the fixpoint operator to each ''stratum'' of the program, from the lowest one up.
Stratification is not only useful for guaranteeing unique interpretation of [[Horn clause]]
theories. It has also been used by [[W.V. Quine]] (1937) to address [[Russell's paradox]], which undermined [[Frege]]'s central work ''[[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]]'' (1902).

==In set theory==
In [[New Foundations]] (NF) and related set theories, a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the language of first-order logic with equality and membership is said to be
'''stratified''' if and only if there is a function
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; which sends each variable appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (considered as an item of syntax) to
a natural number (this works equally well if all integers are used) in such a way that
any atomic formula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)+1 = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt; and any [[atomic formula]] &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It turns out that it is sufficient to require that these conditions be satisfied only when
both variables in an atomic formula are bound in the set abstract &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt;
under consideration.  A set abstract satisfying this weaker condition is said to be
'''weakly stratified'''.

The stratification of [[New Foundations]] generalizes readily to languages with more
predicates and with term constructions.  Each primitive predicate needs to have specified
required displacements between values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at its (bound) arguments
in a (weakly) stratified formula.  In a language with term constructions, terms themselves
need to be assigned values under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, with fixed displacements from the
values of each of their (bound) arguments in a (weakly) stratified formula.  Defined term
constructions are neatly handled by (possibly merely implicitly) using the theory
of descriptions:  a term &lt;math&gt;(\iota x.\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) must
be assigned the same value under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the variable x.

A formula is stratified if and only if it is possible to assign types to all variables appearing
in the formula in such a way that it will make sense in a version TST of the theory of
types described in the [[New Foundations]] article, and this is probably the best way
to understand the stratification of [[New Foundations]] in practice.

The notion of stratification can be extended to the [[lambda calculus]]; this is found
in papers of Randall Holmes.

==In topology==
In [[singularity theory]], there is a different meaning, of a decomposition of a [[topological space]] ''X'' into disjoint subsets each of which is a [[topological manifold]] (so that in particular a  ''stratification'' defines a  [[partition of a set|partition]] of the topological space). This is not a useful notion when unrestricted; but when the various '''strata''' are defined by some recognisable set of conditions (for example being [[locally closed]]), and fit together manageably, this idea is often applied in geometry. [[Hassler Whitney]] and [[René Thom]] first defined formal conditions for stratification.  See [[Whitney stratification]] and [[topologically stratified space]].

==In statistics==
See [[stratified sampling]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''theorem''' is a [[statement (logic)|statement]] that has been [[Mathematical proof|proven]] on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as [[axiom]]s. A theorem is a [[logical consequence]] of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a [[deductive system]]. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally ''[[deductive]]'', in contrast to the notion of a [[scientific law]], which is ''[[experimental]]''.&lt;ref&gt;However, both theorems and scientific law are the result of investigations. See {{harvnb|Heath|1897}} Introduction, The terminology of [[Archimedes]], p. clxxxii:"theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements. In this case, the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called '''hypotheses''' or [[premise]]s. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the [[hypotheses]], namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true, without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain [[deductive system]]s, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol.

Although they can be written in a completely symbolic form, for example, within the [[propositional calculus]], theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way ''why'' it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being "trivial", or "difficult", or "deep", or even "beautiful". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.

== Informal account of theorems ==

[[Logically]], many theorems are of the form of an [[indicative conditional]]: ''if A, then B''. Such a theorem does not assert ''B'', only that ''B'' is a necessary consequence of ''A''. In this case ''A'' is called the '''[[hypothesis]]''' of the theorem ("hypothesis" here is something very different from a [[conjecture]]) and ''B'' the '''conclusion''' (formally, ''A'' and ''B'' are termed the ''antecedent'' and ''consequent''). The theorem "If ''n'' is an even [[natural number]] then ''n''/2 is a natural number" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is "''n'' is an even natural number" and the conclusion is "''n''/2 is also a natural number".

To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement. Nevertheless, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form, with the intention that the reader can produce a formal statement from the informal one.

It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates. The field of mathematics known as [[proof theory]] studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.

[[File:4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|frame|right|A [[Plane (mathematics)|planar]] map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. The [[four color theorem]] states that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.]]
Some theorems are "trivial", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called "deep", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Deep Theorem|urlname=DeepTheorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas.

Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doron Zeilberger|authorlink=Doron Zeilberger|title=Opinion 51|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.&lt;ref&gt;Petkovsek et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

==Provability and theoremhood==

To establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, a line of reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.

==Relation with scientific theories==
{{unreferenced-section|date=February 2018}}
Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their [[epistemology]]. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is [[falsifiable]], that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by [[experiment]]s. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.

[[File:CollatzFractal.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Collatz conjecture]]: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is a [[fractal]], which (in accordance with [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]) resembles the [[Mandelbrot set]].]]
Nonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the [[Collatz conjecture]] has been verified for start values up to about 2.88&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]]. Neither of these statements is considered proved.

Such evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the [[Mertens conjecture]] is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number ''n'' for which the Mertens function ''M''(''n'') equals or exceeds the square root of ''n'') is known: all numbers less than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the [[exponential function|exponential]] of 1.59&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a [[googol]]), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by [[exhaustive search]].

The word "theory" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, [[group theory]]. There are also "theorems" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such "theorems" are based are themselves falsifiable.

==Terminology==
A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.

* An '''[[axiom]]''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically these have been regarded as "self-evident", but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study. In classical geometry, axioms are general statements, while postulates are statements about geometrical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plane Geometry
|first1=G.|last1=Wentworth|first2=D.E.|last2=Smith|publisher=Ginn &amp; Co.
|year=1913|chapter=Art. 46, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[definition]] is also accepted without proof since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.

* An unproved statement that is believed true is called a '''conjecture''' (or sometimes a '''hypothesis''', but with a different meaning from the one discussed above). To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Other famous conjectures include the [[Collatz conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. On the other hand, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as "Fermat's conjecture".
* A '''[[proposition]]''' is a theorem of lesser importance. This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof, while the term '''theorem''' is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. Some authors never use "proposition", while some others use "theorem" only for fundamental results. In classical geometry, this term was used differently: In [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called "propositions" regardless of their importance.
* A '''[[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a "helping theorem", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. In some cases, as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear, what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem, though the word "lemma" remains in the name. Examples include [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].
* A '''[[corollary]]''' is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted [[special case]]. For example, the theorem that all angles in a [[rectangle]] are [[right angle]]s has as corollary that all angles in a [[square]] (a [[special case]] of a rectangle) are [[right angle]]s.
* {{anchor|Converse}}A '''[[Converse (logic)|converse]]''' of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved. For example, the [[isosceles triangle theorem]] states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Follows Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[generalization]]''' is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a [[special case]] and hence as a corollary.

There are other terms, less commonly used, that are conventionally attached to proved statements, so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names. For example:

* An '''[[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]''' is an equality, contained in a theorem, between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of what values are used for any [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[parameter]]s appearing in the expressions. Examples include [[Euler's formula]] and [[Vandermonde's identity]].
* A '''rule''' is a theorem, such as [[Bayes' rule]] and [[Cramer's rule]], that establishes a useful formula.
* A '''[[Laws of science|law]]''' or a '''[[principle]]''' is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include the [[law of large numbers]], the [[law of cosines]], [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]], [[Harnack's principle]], the [[least-upper-bound principle]], and the [[pigeonhole principle]].&lt;ref&gt;The word ''law'' can also refer to an axiom, a [[rule of inference]], or, in [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names. The '''division algorithm''' (see [[Euclidean division]]) is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings. '''[[Bézout's identity]]''' is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers. The '''[[Banach–Tarski paradox]]''' is a theorem in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] that is [[paradox]]ical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three-dimensional space.

==Layout==

A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:

:'''Theorem''' (name of person who proved it and year of discovery, proof or publication).
:''Statement of theorem (sometimes called the ''proposition'').''
:'''Proof'''.
:''Description of proof.''
:''End''

The end of the proof may be signalled by the letters [[Q.E.D.]] (''quod erat demonstrandum'') or by one of the [[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]] marks "□" or "∎" meaning "End of Proof", introduced by [[Paul Halmos]] following their usage in magazine articles.

The exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for typesetting in the [[Style guide|house style]].

It is common for a theorem to be preceded by [[definition]]s describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.

Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.

==Lore==

It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998,  p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[aphorism]], [[q:Paul Erdős|"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems"]], is probably due to [[Alfréd Rényi]], although it is often attributed to Rényi's colleague [[Paul Erdős]] (and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the [[Erdős number|number]] of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups], Richard Elwes, Plus Magazine, Issue 41 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem of this type is the [[four color theorem]] whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.

==Theorems in logic==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[Logic]], especially in the field of proof theory, considers theorems as statements (called '''[[formula]]s''' or '''[[well formed formula]]s''') of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and  may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A set of '''deduction rules''', also called '''transformation rules''' or [[rules of inference]], must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], a formal system often simply defines all its well-formed formula as theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter 1980&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|Also need to know the edition, and verify that in the references.  There are at least 4 English language editions of the book, in 1979, 1980, and two in 1999.|date=October 2010}}

Different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use [[first-order logic]]. Other deductive systems describe [[term rewriting]], such as the reduction rules for [[lambda calculus|λ calculus]].

The definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is Gödel's incompleteness theorem; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, Gödel constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- stop picture bleeding into completely unrelated next section --&gt;

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that can be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.]]
A theorem may be expressed in a [[formal language]] (or "formalized"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem. In general, a formal theorem is a type of [[well-formed formula]] that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions. The notation {{tee}} &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is often used to indicate that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem.

Formal theorems consist of [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] of a formal language and the [[transformation rule]]s of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a [[formal proof|derivation]] in some formal system each formula of which is a [[logical consequence]] of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its '''axioms''', and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of theorems is called a '''theory'''.

What makes formal theorems useful and of interest is that they can be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as true [[proposition]]s and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the [[truth]] of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a '''[[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]]'''. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system is called a '''[[metatheorem]]'''.

=== Syntax and semantics ===
{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}

The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a ''true proposition,'' which introduces [[semantics]]. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. [[belief]], [[Theory of justification|justification]] or other [[Modal logic|modalities]]). The [[soundness]] of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also [[Validity (logic)|validities]]. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. A formal system is considered [[completeness (logic)|semantically complete]] when all of its tautologies are also theorems.

=== Derivation of a theorem ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

The notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof (also called a "derivation"). To illustrate how derivations are done, we will work in a very simplified formal system. Let us call ours &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; Its alphabet consists only of two symbols { '''A''', '''B''' } and its formation rule for formulas is:
:Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; that is at least three symbols long, and is not infinitely long, is a formula. Nothing else is a formula.

The single axiom of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:'''ABBA'''.

The only [[rule of inference]] (transformation rule) for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:Any occurrence of "'''A'''" in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string "'''AB'''" and the result is a theorem.

Theorems in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as those formulae that have a derivation ending with that formula. For example,

#'''ABBA''' (Given as axiom)
#'''ABBBA''' (by applying the transformation rule)
#'''ABBBAB''' (by applying the transformation rule)

is a derivation. Therefore, "'''ABBBAB'''" is a theorem of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS} \,.&lt;/math&gt; The notion of truth (or falsity) cannot be applied to the formula "'''ABBBAB'''" until an interpretation is given to its symbols. Thus in this example, the formula does not yet represent a proposition, but is merely an empty abstraction.

Two metatheorems of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are:
:Every theorem begins with "'''A'''".
:Every theorem has exactly two "'''A'''"s.

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''ultrafinitism''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"&gt;International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity, ''Logic and Computational Complexity'', Springer, 1995, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict formalism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"&gt;St. Iwan (2000), "On the Untenability of Nelson's Predicativism", ''Erkenntnis'' '''53'''(1–2), pp. 147–154.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict finitism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; '''actualism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"/&gt; '''predicativism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Russell's [[predicativism]].&lt;/ref&gt; and '''strong finitism''')&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; is a form of [[finitism]]. There are various philosophies of mathematics that are called ultrafinitism. A major identifying property common among most of these philosophies is their objections to [[total function|totality]] of number theoretic functions like [[exponentiation]] over [[natural number]]s.

==Main ideas==
Like other [[finitism|finitists]], ultrafinitists deny the existence of the [[infinite set]] '''N''' of [[natural numbers]].

In addition, some ultrafinitists are concerned with acceptance of objects in mathematics that no one can construct in practice because of physical restrictions in constructing large finite mathematical objects.
Thus some ultrafinitists will deny or refrain from accepting the existence of large numbers, for example, the [[floor function|floor]] of the first [[Skewes's number]], which is a huge number defined using the [[exponential function]] as exp(exp(exp(79))), or
: &lt;math&gt; e^{e^{e^{79}}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The reason is that nobody has yet calculated what [[natural number]] is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of this [[real number]], and it may not even be physically possible to do so. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; (in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]) would be considered only a formal expression which does not correspond to a natural number.  The brand of ultrafinitism concerned with physical realizability of mathematics is often called [[actualism]].

[[Edward Nelson]] criticized the classical conception of natural numbers because of the circularity of its definition. In classical mathematics the natural numbers are defined as 0 and numbers obtained by the iterative applications of the successor function to 0. But the concept of natural number is already assumed for the iteration. In other words, to obtain a number like &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; one needs to perform the successor function iteratively, in fact exactly &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; times to 0.

Some versions of ultrafinitism are forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]], but most constructivists view the philosophy as unworkably extreme.  The logical foundation of ultrafinitism is unclear; in his comprehensive survey ''Constructivism in Mathematics'' (1988), the constructive logician [[A. S. Troelstra]] dismissed it by saying "no satisfactory development exists at present." This was not so much a philosophical objection as it was an admission that, in a rigorous work of [[mathematical logic]], there was simply nothing precise enough to include.

== People associated with ultrafinitism ==
Serious work on ultrafinitism has been led, since 1959, by [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], who in 1961 sketched a program for proving the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] in ultrafinite mathematics.  Other mathematicians who have worked in the topic include [[Doron Zeilberger]], [[Edward Nelson]], [[Rohit Jivanlal Parikh]], and [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]]. The philosophy is also sometimes associated with the beliefs of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Robin Gandy]], [[Petr Vopenka]], and [[J. Hjelmslev]].

[[Shaughan Lavine]] has developed a form of set-theoretical ultra-finitism that is consistent with classical mathematics.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/ |title=Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lavine has shown that the basic principles of arithmetic such as "there is no largest natural number" can be upheld, as Lavine allows for the inclusion of "indefinitely large" numbers.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

== Computational complexity theory based restrictions ==
Other considerations of the possibility of avoiding unwieldy large numbers can be based on [[computational complexity theory]], as in [[Andras Kornai]]'s work on explicit finitism (which does not deny the existence of large numbers)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713221118/http://kornai.com/Drafts/fathom_3.html "Relation to foundations"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Sazonov]]'s notion of [[feasible number]].

There has also been considerable formal development on versions of ultrafinitism that are based on complexity theory, like [[Samuel Buss]]'s [[Bounded Arithmetic]] theories, which capture mathematics associated with various complexity classes like [[P (complexity)|P]] and [[PSPACE]]. Buss's work can be considered the continuation of [[Edward Nelson]]'s work on [[predicative arithmetic]] as bounded arithmetic theories like S12 are interpretable in [[Raphael Robinson]]'s theory [[Robinson arithmetic|Q]] and therefore are predicative in [[Edward Nelson|Nelson]]'s sense.  The power of these theories for developing mathematics is studied in [[Bounded reverse mathematics]] as can be found in the works of [[Stephen A. Cook]] and [[Phuong The Nguyen]]. However these researches are not philosophies of mathematics but rather the study of restricted forms of reasoning similar to [[Reverse Mathematics]].

'''Viral dynamics''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]] concerned with describing the progression of viral infections within a host organism.&lt;ref name="VDbook" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert |date=2001 |title=Virus Dynamics: mathematical principles of immunology and virology | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kixhc3IiCy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=virus+dynamics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9yXeVIHfH4a8yQTipIGYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virus%20dynamics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs a family of [[mathematical model]]s that describe changes over time in the populations of cells targeted by the virus and the [[viral load]]. These equations may also track competition between different viral strains and the influence of immune responses. The original viral dynamics models were inspired by compartmental [[epidemic model]]s (e.g. the SI model), with which they continue to share many common mathematical features, such as the concept of the [[basic reproduction number|basic reproductive ratio]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The major distinction between these fields is in the scale at which the models operate: while epidemiological models track the spread of infection between individuals within a population (i.e. "between host"), viral dynamics models track the spread of infection between cells within an individual (i.e. "within host"). Analyses employing viral dynamic models have been used extensively to study [[HIV]],&lt;ref name="VDbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perelson|first1=Alan S|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ruy M|title=Modeling the within-host dynamics of HIV infection|journal=BMC Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-96|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/96/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hepatitis B virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=MA|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=S|last3=Hill|first3=AM|last4=Boehme|first4=R|last5=Thomas|first5=HC|last6=McDade|first6=H|title=Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1996|volume=93|pages=4398–4402| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/9/4398.short|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.9.4398|pmc=39549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciupe|first1=SM|last2=Ribeiro|first2=RM|last3=Nelson|first3=PW|last4=Perelson|first4=AS|title=Modeling the mechanisms of acute hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=2007|volume=247|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.02.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307000938|pmc=1994818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis C virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=A|last2=Lam|first2=NP|last3=Dahari|first3=H|last4=Gretch|first4=DR|last5=Wiley|first5=TE|last6=Layden|first6=TJ|last7=Perelson|first7=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo and the Antiviral Efficacy of Interferon-α Therapy|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=282|issue=5386|pages=103–107|doi=10.1126/science.282.5386.103|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5386/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=A|last2=Smith|first2=PF|last3=Perelson|first3=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics: The Past, Present, and Future|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=2013|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.09.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326112000992|pmc=3584572}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other infections

'''Wilhelm Winkler''' (June 29, 1884 – September 3, 1984) had successful careers as both an academic [[statistician]] (despite receiving no formal academic training in the field), and a program director in the Austrian government.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wilhelm was the fifth&lt;ref name="Pinw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinwinkler|first1=Alexander|editor1-last=Heyde|editor1-first=C.

J.|last2=Robertson|first2=E. F.|title=Winkler biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Winkler.html|publisher=MacTutor Biographies|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended law school at Karl Friedrich University (now [[Charles University]]) in Prague, practiced law briefly in 1908, did a stint in the Austrian army, then settled into a position at the Statistical Bureau of Bohemia&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; as the sole German-speaking statistician.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; While working there, he attended many university classes and reached the conclusion that "the German statistical literature did not offer too many ideas. New life came into statistics from England and Russia where the importance of mathematical tools was recognized."&lt;ref name="100bday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmetterer|first1=L.|title=Tribute to Wilhelm Winkler at His 100th Anniversary|journal=International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique|date=1984|volume=52|issue=3|pages=227–228|jstor=1403044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War years===
Winkler re-enlisted in the Austrian army at the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, and was decorated twice for bravery before being wounded in November 1915.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; During a lengthy recovery, he worked for the War Economy committee; his talents were recognized and he was appointed Secretary of State for Military Affairs at the end of the war in 1918 and he was a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]]. That year, he also married a Jewish woman named Clara Deutch. He joined the Austrian Central Statistics Office in 1920, and was promoted to director of its department of population statistics in 1925.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Concurrently, he became a ''Privat-Dozent'' (assistant professor) at the University of Vienna in 1921 and an ''Ausserordentlicher Professor'' in 1929. He founded an institute for the study of minority populations,&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; which published a constant stream of progressive and influential papers that made him unpopular with colleagues in his government job.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; Despite his lack of formal education, he was elected a member of the International Statistical Institute in 1926 where he actively promoted applied and precise mathematical formulations in contrast to the wordy generalizations that he had criticized 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; As both the husband of a Jew and an outspoken critic of the unfair treatment of European minorities, Winkler was promptly fired from both his government and academic positions following the 1938 [[Anschluss|Nazi annexation of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Despite severe persecution from the Nazi party, he wrote the textbook ''Basic Course in Demography'' during the occupation.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt;

===Later years===
At the end of the war, he was rehired by the University of Vienna as the first full professor of statistics since 1883, and became Dean of the School of Law and Statecraft from 1950 to 1955. He was also restored as Austria's lead government statistician from 1945 to 1955.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Despite these influential positions and growing international recognition, Winkler spent many years defending the statistical department from opposition within the university.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; The regressive attitude of Austrian and German academics towards statistics as a truly independent discipline meant that his contributions to international developments became more difficult.&lt;ref name="Pinw2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heyde|first1=C.

He died just after his 100th birthday, having published 20 textbooks and over 200 papers, founded two statistical societies, edited two statistical journals, been awarded two honorary degrees, and reshaped the development of German-speaking statistics through his progressive education initiatives.&lt;ref name="100bday"/&gt;
