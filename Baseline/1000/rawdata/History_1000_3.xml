*'''January 20''': Six exporting countries - [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Economy of Iran|Iran]], [[Economy of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Economy of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Economy of Qatar|Qatar]] and [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] - conclude ten days of meetings with Western oil companies. An agreement is reached to raise the posted price of crude by 8.49 percent to offset the loss in value of oil concessions attributable to the decline in value of the U.S. dollar.
*'''March 11''': [[OPEC]] threatens "appropriate sanctions" against companies that "fail to comply with . . . any action taken by a Member Country in accordance with [OPEC] decisions."
*'''June 1''': Iraq nationalizes Iraq Petroleum Company's (IPC) concession owned by [[British Petroleum]], [[Royal Dutch-Shell]], [[Total S.A.|Compagnie Francaise des Petroles]], [[Mobil]] and Standard Oil of New Jersey (now [[Exxon]]). The concessions were valued at over one billion dollars.
*'''June 9''': In a show of support for Iraq, [[OPEC]] moves to prevent companies whose interests were nationalized in Iraq from increasing production elsewhere; appoints mediators between Iraq and IPC.
*'''September 30''': [[Libya]] acquires a 50 percent interest in two ENI concessions.
*'''October 27''': [[OPEC]] approves plan providing for 25 percent government ownership of all Western oil interests operating within Kuwait, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia beginning on January 1, 1973, and rising to 51 percent by January 1, 1983. (Iraq declines to agree.) Agreements signed on December 21.

[[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line depicted, [[Biblioteca Estense]], [[Modena]]]]

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519‚Äì1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the Indian Ocean by this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/bartolomeudias.html |title=Bartolomeu Dias |website=infoplease |publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc. |date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] funded [[Christopher Columbus]]'s plan to sail west to reach the [[Indies]] by crossing the Atlantic. He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus ‚Äì Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas ‚Äì The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von L√ºbeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von L√ºbeck]]'' (1567‚Äì1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102‚Äì04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156‚Äì61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241‚Äì1438) ===

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[Andr√© de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24‚Äì25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccol√≤ de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466‚Äì1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405‚Äì1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618‚Äì907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks‚Äîthat the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]‚Äîmay have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tom√© Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Col√≥quios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders‚Äîmainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]‚Äîdominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339‚Äì49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===
{{See also|Portuguese discoveries|European exploration of Africa}}
[[File:Niger saharan medieval trade routes.PNG|thumb|[[Trans-Saharan trade|Saharan trade routes]] c. 1400, with modern [[Niger]] highlighted]]
In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29‚Äì31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto ‚Äì (1450‚Äì1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132‚Äì34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[√Ålvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry ‚Äì including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] ‚Äì discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of [[caravel]] ship introduced in the mid-15th century for oceanic exploration]]

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fern√£o Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145‚Äì48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[Jo√£o de Santar√©m]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gon√ßalves, [[Fern√£o do P√≥]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|Jo√£o II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|S√£o Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo C√£o]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[P√™ro da Covilh√£]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperan√ßa), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram √† Am√©rica 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492‚Äì1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa Mar√≠a (ship)|Santa Mar√≠a]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Ni√±a]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagar√≠x|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Ni√±a]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa Mar√≠a (ship)|Santa Mar√≠a]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries‚Äîunlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land‚Äîpreventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107‚Äì11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro √Ålvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseem√ºller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[Jo√£o Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[P√™ro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463‚Äì64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464‚Äì65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499‚Äì1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]].

The 1515‚Äì16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Sol√≠s and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[R√≠o de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro √Ålvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de P√™ro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492‚Äì1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494‚Äîso his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456‚Äì62.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîa Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclop√¶dia 2|Catholic Encyclop√¶dia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîparticipated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295‚Äì300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseem√ºller map|Martin Waldseem√ºller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501‚Äì1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gon√ßalo Coelho]] (and/or [[Andr√© Gon√ßalves (explorer)|Andr√© Gon√ßalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52¬∞ S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32¬∞ S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50¬∞/52¬∞ S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511‚Äì1512, Portuguese captains [[Jo√£o de Lisboa]] and Estev√£o de Fr√≥is reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42¬∞S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524‚Äì1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Sol√≠s expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaran√≠ people|Guaran√≠ Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Ocean (1497‚Äì1513)==

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497‚Äì1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[P√™ro da Covilh√£]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65‚Äì75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[P√™ro da Covilh√£]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]‚Äîwhere Dias had turned back‚Äîand sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro √Ålvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Trist√£o da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Louren√ßo de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"‚Äîthe [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea‚Äîhe sent an expedition led by [[Ant√≥nio de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5‚Äì7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortes√£o|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tom√© Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512‚Äì1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serr√£o]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge √Ålvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]‚Äîa cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]‚Äîwho became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fern√£o Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" ‰ΩõÈÉéÊ©ü ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[Ant√≥nio Correia (admiral)|Ant√≥nio Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Est√™v√£o da Gama (16th century)|Estev√£o da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acand√≠]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipi√©lago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

In 1515‚Äì1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[R√≠o de la Plata]], which Sol√≠s named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Lu√ß√µes]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519‚Äì1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Est√™v√£o Gomes]], [[Jo√£o Serr√£o]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan‚Äîwho had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serr√£o]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîdeveloped the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships‚Äîthe [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"‚Äîwith a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean‚Äîthen named ''Mar Pac√≠fico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclop√¶dia 2007|Catholic Encyclop√¶dia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano]] and Loa√≠sa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andr√©s de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56¬∞ S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hern√°n Cort√©s]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[√Ålvaro de Saavedra Cer√≥n]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andr√©s de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519‚Äì1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de Le√≥n]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84‚Äì88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, L√©on set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''‚Äîbecause it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season‚Äîbelieving it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29‚Äì32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de Le√≥n Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cort√©s' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucat√°n|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Ruta de Cort√©s.svg|thumb|Route of Cort√©s inland progress 1519‚Äì1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (Yucat√°n conquistador)|Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba]] to explore the [[Yucat√°n peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Vel√°zquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Vel√°zquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hern√°n Cort√©s]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cort√©s went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucat√°n, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cort√©s learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cort√©s asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitl√°n]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cort√©s' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cort√©s enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cort√©s claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself‚Äîa belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659‚Äì87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez]], to oppose Cort√®s, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cort√©s left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitl√°n one of Cort√©s's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cort√©s speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cort√©s [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitl√°n]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauht√©moc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531‚Äì1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pir√∫. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pir√∫" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hern√°n Cort√©s]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulaci√≥n de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hern√°ndo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Hu√°scar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542‚Äì1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fern√£o Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andr√©s de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492‚Äì1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kan≈ç Naizen]], 1570‚Äì1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of L√≥pez de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 ‚Äì 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609‚Äì1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520‚Äì1521 the Portuguese [[Jo√£o √Ålvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban G√≥mez|Estev√£o Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81‚Äì82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo|Jo√£o Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site‚Äîthe actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîand claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fern√°ndez (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136‚Äì246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres|Luis V√°ez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642‚Äì1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581‚Äì1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649‚Äì50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650‚Äì53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659‚Äì65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733‚Äì1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.

(See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50‚Äì90% of their population.

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops‚Äîwheat, millet, and rice‚Äîcould not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198‚Äì201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19‚Äì20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573‚Äîafter the Spanish established a trading base in Manila‚Äîthe Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552‚Äì1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562‚Äì1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551‚Äì1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410‚Äì411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly‚Äìused synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]‚Äîwhere Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîand ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559‚Äì1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205‚Äì206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43‚Äì44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potos√≠]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523‚Äì25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Anno Lucis''' (‚Äúin the Year of Light‚Äù) is a dating system used in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian year]] plus 4000. It is similar to ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.

==Description==
For example, a date [[Anno Domini]] (A.D.) {{currentyear}} becomes Anno Lucis (A.L.) {{#expr:{{currentyear}}+4000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/# | title = What is the Masonic Calendar? | author = | accessdate = 2006-07-06 | publisher = Library and Museum Charitable Trust of the United Grand Lodge of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[calendar era]], which would designate 4001&amp;nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]] as '[[year zero]]', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the ''Anno Mundi'' era dating system used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the [[Dating creation|year of creation]].

After the [[Masoretic]] text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades.&lt;ref name=Jones26&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsITeHwP9K0C&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=%22date+of+creation%22+%22no+dispute%22&amp;f=false |title=Chronology of the Old Testament: Solving the Bible's Most Intriguing Mysteries |author=Floyd Nolen Jones |publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-89051-416-0 |page=26 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Isaac Newton]]'s calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=Jones26/&gt; 

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, [[Ussher chronology|Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: October 23, 4004 B.C |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by [[Hillel II]], dated the creation to 3761 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |title=Definition of Jewish Calendar from |publisher=dictionary.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |title=The Jewish Calendar and Biblical Authority |publisher=Askelm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074827/http://askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' compiled by [[Jose ben Halafta]] in AD 160, and in agreement with ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', in which the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] identifies ''anno mundi'' as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]] but not with ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'', which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.&lt;ref&gt;Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939‚Äîentry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaic globalization''' is a phase in the [[history of globalization]], and conventionally refers to globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly 1600 (the following period is known as [[early modern globalization]]). Archaic globalization describes the relationships between [[communities]] and [[state (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and [[social norm]]s at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States began to interact and trade with others within close proximity as a way to acquire coveted goods that were considered [[luxury goods|a luxury]]. This trade led to the spread of ideas such as religion, economic structures and political ideals. [[Merchant]]s became connected and aware of others in ways that had not been apparent. Archaic globalization is comparable to present day [[globalization]] on a much smaller scale. It not only allowed the spread of [[goods]] and [[commodities]] to other regions, but it also allowed people to experience other cultures. Cities that partook in trading were bound together by [[sea lane]]s, [[inland shipping|rivers]], and great overland [[trade route]]s, some of which had been in use since antiquity.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trading was broken up according to geographic location, with centers between flanking places serving as "[[breakbulk|break-in-bulk]]" and exchange points for goods destined for more distant markets.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"/&gt; During this time period the subsystems were more self-sufficient than they are today and therefore less vitally dependent upon one another for everyday survival.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"/&gt; While long distance trading came with many trials and tribulations, still so much of it went on during this early time period. Linking the trade together involved eight interlinked subsystems that were grouped into three large circuits, which encompassed the [[western Europe]]an, the [[Middle East]]ern, and the [[Far East]]ern circuits. This interaction during trading was early civilization's way to communicate and spread many ideas that caused [[modern globalization]] to emerge and allowed a new aspect to present-day society.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Defining globalization==
Globalization is the process of increasing interconnectedness between regions and individuals. Steps toward globalization include economic, political, technological, social, and cultural connections around the world. The term "archaic" can be described as early ideals and functions that were once historically apparent in society but may have disintegrated over time.

There are three main prerequisites for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East.&lt;ref name="M 47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; With early globalization it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with [[interdependency]], stability and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another then there is no way for them to be mutually affected by one another. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of a world system==
Historians argue that a [[world system]] was in order before the rise of capitalism between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is referred to as the early age of capitalism where long-distance trade, market exchange and capital accumulation existed amongst states.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; In 800 AD Greek, Roman and Muslim empires emerged covering areas known today as China and the Middle East. Major religions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism spread to distant lands where many are still intact today. One of the most popular examples of distant trade routes can be seen with the silk route between China and the Mediterranean, movement and trade with art and luxury goods between Arab regions, South Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships through trade mainly formed in the east and eventually led to the development of capitalism. It was at this time that power and land shifted from the nobility and church to the bourgeoisie and division of labor in production emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Ino|title=Frontiers of Globalization Research: Theoretical and Methodological Approaches|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|pages=33‚Äì36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the later part of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth century an international trade system was developed between states ranging from northwestern Europe to China.&lt;ref name="A-L 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250‚Äì1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1500s other Asian empires emerged, which included trading over longer distances than before. During the early exchanges between states, Europe had little to offer with the exception of slaves, metals, wood and furs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250‚Äì1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push for selling of items in the east drove European production and helped integrate them into the exchange.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European expansion and growth of opportunities for trade made possible by the Crusades increased the renaissance of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt; Rapid urbanization throughout Europe allowed a connection from the North Sea to Venice.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt; Advances in industrialization coupled with the rouse of population growth and the growing demands of the eastern trade, led to the growth of true trading emporia with outlets to the sea.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt;

There is a 'multi-polar' nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, in which [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by [[Europe]] but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal China and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans K√∂chler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pre-capitalist movements were regional rather than global and for the most part temporary. This idea of early globalization was proposed by the historian [[A.G. Hopkins]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pramanick|title=Globalization in India: New Frontiers Emerging|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=New Dehli|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hopkins main points on archaic globalization can be seen with trade, and diaspora that developed from this, as well as religious ideas and empires that spread throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new interaction amongst states led to interconnections between parts of the world which led to the eventual interdependency amongst these state actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main actors that partook in the spreading of goods and ideas were kings, warriors, priests and traders. Hopkins also addresses that during this time period mini-globalizations were prominent and that some collapsed or became more insular.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; These mini-globalizations are referred to as episodic and ruptured, with empires sometimes overreaching and having to retract.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; These mini-globalizations left remnants that allowed the West to adopt these new ideals, leading to the idea of [[Western Capitalism]]. The adopted ideals can be seen in the Western monetary system and are central to systems like capitalism that define modernity and modern globalization.&lt;ref name="M 48"/&gt;

=== The three principles of archaic globalization ===
Archaic globalization consists of three principles: universalizing kingship, expansion of religious movements, and medicinal understanding.
* The universalizing of kingship led soldiers and monarchs far distances to find honor and prestige. However, the crossing over foreign lands also gave the traveling men opportunity to exchange prized goods. This expanded trade between distant lands, which consequently increased the amount of social and economic relations.
* Despite the vast distances covered by monarchs and their companies, [[pilgrimages]] remain one of the greatest global movements of people.
* Finally, the desire for better health was the remaining push behind archaic globalization. While the trading of spices, precious stones, animals, and weapons remained of major importance, people began to seek medicine from faraway lands. This implemented more trade routes, especially to China for their tea.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Bayly, ''Birth of the Modern World'', (Oxford, 2004) pp. 42‚Äì44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic exchange===
With the increase in trade and state linkage, economic exchange extended throughout the region and caused actors to form new relationships.&lt;ref name="M 44"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This early economic development can be seen in [[Champagne Fairs]], which were outdoor markets where traveling merchants came to sell their products and make purchases.&lt;ref name="A-L 52"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, market fairs used barter as opposed to money, once larger itinerant merchants began to frequent them, the need for currency became greater and a money changer needed to be established.&lt;ref name="A-L 52"/&gt; Some historical scholars{{Who|date=June 2011}} argue that this was the beginning of the role of banker and the institution of credit. An example can be seen with one individual in need of an item the urban merchant does not ordinarily stock. The product seeker orders the item, which the merchant promises to bring him next time. The product seeker either gives credit to the merchant by paying them in advance, gets credit from the merchant by promising to pay them once the item is in stock, or some type of concession is made through a down payment. If the product seeker does not have the amount required by the merchant he may borrow from the capital stored by the money changer or he may mortgage part of his expected harvest, either from the money charger or the merchant he is seeking goods from.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lengthy transaction eventually resulted in a complex economic system and once the weekly market began to expand from barter to the monetized system required by long-distance trading.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt;

A higher circuit of trade developed once urban traders from outside city limits travelled from distant directions to the market center in the quest to buy or sell goods. Merchants would then begin to meet at the same spot on a weekly basis allowing for them to arrange with other merchants to bring special items for exchange that were not demanded by the local agriculturalists but for markets in their home towns.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt; When the local individuals placed advanced orders, customers from towns of different traders may begin to place order for items in a distant town that their trader can order from their counterpart. This central meeting point, becomes the focus of long-distance trade and how it began to increase.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt;

===Expansion of long distance trade===
In order for trade to be able to expand during this early time period, it required some basic functions of the market as well as the merchants. The first was security. Goods that were being transported began to have more value and the merchants needed to protect their coveted goods especially since they were often traveling through poor areas where the risk of theft was high. To overcome this problem merchants began to travel in [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] as a way to ensure their personal safety as well as the safety of their goods.&lt;ref name="A-L 54"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second prerequisite to early long distant trade had to be an agreement on a rate of exchange. Since many of the merchants came from distant lands with different monetary systems a system had to be put into place as a way to enforce repayment of previous goods, repay previous debt and to ensure contracts were upheld.&lt;ref name="A-L 54"/&gt; Expansion was also able to thrive so long as it had a motive for exchange as a way to promote trade amongst foreign lands. Also, outside merchants access to trading sites was a critical factor in trade route growth.

===The spread of goods and ideas===
The most popular goods produced were spices, which were traded over short distances, while manufactured goods were central to the system and could not have been aided without them.&lt;ref name="A-L 8"/&gt; The invention of money in the form of gold coins in Europe and Middle East and paper money in China around the thirteenth century allowed trade to move more easily between the different actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main actors involved in this system viewed gold, silver, and copper as valuable on different levels. Nevertheless, goods were transferred, prices set, exchange rates agreed upon, contracts entered into, credit extended, partnerships formed and agreements that were made were kept on record and honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250‚Äì1350|year=1991|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of globalization, credit was also used as a means for trading. The use of credit began in the form of blood ties but later led to the emergence the "banker" as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|pages=15‚Äì16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spread of people came new ideas, religion and goods throughout the land, which had never been apparent in most societies before the movement.&lt;ref name="M 44"/&gt;  Also, this globalization lessened the degree of [[feudal]] life by transitioning from self-sufficient society to a money economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobb|first=Maurice|title=Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism|year=1962|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the trade connecting North Africa and Europe was controlled by the Middle East, China and India around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the danger and great cost of long-distance travel in the pre-modern period, archaic globalization grew out of the trade in high-value commodities which took up a small amount of space. Most of the goods that were produced and traded were considered a luxury and many{{Who|date=June 2011}} considered those with these coveted items to have a higher place on the societal scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Examples of such luxury goods would include Chinese silks, exotic herbs, coffee, cotton, iron, Indian [[Calico (textile)|calicoes]], [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Gemstone|gems]] and spices or drugs such as [[nutmeg]], [[cloves]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[ambergris]] and [[opium]]. The thirteenth century as well as present day favor luxury items due to the fact that small high-value goods can have high transport costs but still have a high value attached to them, whereas low-value heavy goods are not worth carrying very far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases of luxury items such as these are described as archaic consumption since trade was largely popular for these items as opposed to everyday needs. The distinction between [[food]], [[drugs]] and [[materia medica]] is often quite blurred in regards to these substances, which were valued not only for their rarity but because they appealed to [[humorism|humoral theories]] of health and the body that were prevalent throughout premodern [[Eurasia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Major trade routes===
During the time of archaic globalization there were three major trade routes which connected Europe, China and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern most route went through mostly the [[Mongol Empire]] and was nearly 5000 miles long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the route consisted of mostly vast stretches of desert with little to no resources, merchants still traveled it. The route was still traveled because during the 13th century [[Kubilai Khan]] united the Mongol Empire and charged only a small protective rent to travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the unification, merchants from the Middle East used the path but were stopped and taxed at nearly every village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle route went from the coast of Syria to Baghdad from there the traveler could follow the land route through Persia to India, or sail to India via the Persian Gulf. Between the 8th and 10th centuries, Baghdad was a world city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 11th century it began to decline due to natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, and fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1258, Baghdad was taken over by the Mongols. The Mongols forced high taxes on the citizens of Baghdad which led to a decrease in production, causing merchants to bypass the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, southern most route, went through Mamluk controlled Egypt, After the fall of Baghdad, Cairo became the Islamic capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major cities along these trading routes were wealthy and provided services for merchants and the  international markets. Palmyra and Petra which are located on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, flourished mainly as power centers of trading. They would police the trade routes and be the source of supplies for the merchants caravans. They also became places where people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds could meet and interact. These trading routes were the communication highways for the ancient civilizations and their societies. New inventions, religious beliefs, artistic styles, languages, and social customs, as well as goods and raw materials, were transmitted by people moving from one place to another to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art. "Trade Routes between Europe and Asia during Antiquity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/trade/hd_trade.htm (October 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-globalization===
[[Proto-globalization]] is the period following archaic globalization which occurred from the 17th through the 19th centuries. The global routes established within the period of archaic globalization gave way to more distinguished expanding routes and more complex systems of trade within the period of proto-globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Ny: Norton|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar trading arrangements such as the [[East India Company]] appeared within this period, making larger-scale exchanges possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=A.C|title=The Birth of the Modern World|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Slave trading was especially extensive and the associated mass-production of [[commodities]] on [[plantations]] is characteristic of this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=C.A.|title=The Birth of the Modern World|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a measurable amount of polyethnic regions due to these higher frequency trade routes, war became prominent. Such wars include the [[French and Indian War]], [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Norton|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|pages=4‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anglo-Dutch War]] between England and the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rommelse|first=Gijs|title=The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)|year=2006|publisher=Hilversum|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern globalization===
The modern form of globalization began to take form during the 19th century. The evolving beginnings of this period were largely responsible for the expansion of the West, capitalism and [[imperialism]] backed up by the [[nation-state]] and industrial technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|pages=53‚Äì54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began to emerge during the 1500s, continuing to expand exponentially over time as industrialization developed in the 18th century. The conquests of the British Empire and the Opium Wars added to the industrialization and formation of the growing global society because it created vast consumer regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] is when the first phase of modern globalization began to take force. It is said by [[VM Yeates]] that the economic forces of globalization were part of the cause of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeates|first=VM|title=Winged Victory|year=1962|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=54‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since World War I, globalization has expanded greatly. The evolving improvements of [[multinational corporations]], technology, science, and [[mass media]] have all been results of extensive worldwide exchanges. In addition, institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and many international telecommunication companies have also shaped modern globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jurgen|first=Osterhammel|title=Globalization: A Short History|year=2005|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Wide Web has also played a large role in modern globalization. The [[Internet]] provides connectivity across national and international borders, aiding in the enlargement of a global network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elmer|first=Greg|title=Critical Perspectives on the Internet|year=2002|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aulic titulature''' is a term, derived from the Greek ''aul√®'' and Latin [[wikt:aula#Latin|aula]] (in the meaning ''palace'') for hierarchic systems of titles specifically in use for court protocol.

==Hellenistic antiquity==
Ironically in the formal "court" titulature of the [[Hellenistic]] empires ruled by dynasties we know as [[Diadoch]]s, the title ''diadochos'' was not customary for the Monarch, but has actually been proven to be the ''lowest'' in a system of official rank titles, known as aulic titulature, conferred - ex officio or nominatim - to actual courtiers {{em|and}} as an honorary rank (for protocol) to various military and civilian officials. 

Notably in Lagid Egypt, diadochos was reported as the lowest aulic rank, under ''philos [basilikos]'' ("friend [of the king]"), ''archisomatophylax'' ("arch-bodyguard"), ''protos philos'' ("first friend"), ''homotimos'' ("[nearly] equal dignitary") and ''syggeneus'' ("cognate of the crown"), during the reign of [[Ptolemaios V Epiphanes]]. A similar system of titles was in place in other Hellenistic monarchies. In the Ptolemaic court, the aulic titulature is also distinguished from the titles awarded ''honoris causa''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Courts and Elites in the Hellenistic Empires: The Near East After the Achaemenids, c. 330 to 30 BCE|last=Strootman|first=Rolf|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780748691265|location=Edinburgh|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; since several are determined by ''aulic'' functions such as the [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] or the master of the hunt. 

Scholars describe the ''aulic titulature'' as a complex system and that the meanings of the many known titles within it are unknown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One approach of understanding it is through the view that it is a form of formalised informality where a ''philos''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' power position, for instance, at court was indicated by his title and not necessarily fixed by it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the [[Hierarchy|hierarchisation]] in the court titulature and the status differentiation is seen as advantageous to the king, it is also believed to be an instrument for the top of the court society to close their ranks as they jockey for positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Royal Courts in Dynastic States and Empires: A Global Perspective|last=Duindam|first=Jeroen|last2=Artan|first2=Kunt|last3=Metin|first3=T√ºlay|publisher=BRILL|year=2011|isbn=9789004206229|location=Leiden|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly supposed that the institution of a system of court ranks and titles was intended to reinforce the bond between the monarch and his ministers by playing on the vanity of the courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|last=Astin|first=A.E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982|isbn=9780521234450|location=Cambridge|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also accounts that show how the distribution of ''aulic'' titles served as a form of gift exchange and that the recipient was awarded gifts such as purple clothing, crowns, and horse trappings in order to show his rank or to derive his status from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=O0E_LZdgFVwC&amp;pg=PT77&amp;dq=Aulic+titulature+is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjps_2J4NLeAhUIUt4KHaglCvYQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Aulic%20titulature%20is&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to Ancient Greek Government|last=Beck|first=Hans|date=2013-01-22|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118303177|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blackwell AHA Prize==

'''Black Aggie''' is the [[folklore|folkloric]] name given to a statue formerly placed on the grave of General [[Felix Agnus]] in [[Druid Ridge Cemetery]] in [[Pikesville, Maryland]]. It is an unauthorized replica ‚Äî rendered by [[Edward Ludwig Albert Pausch]] ‚Äî of sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]' 1891 allegorical figure, popularly called ''Grief'', at the [[Adams Memorial (grave marker)|Adams Memorial]] in [[Rock Creek Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Mills  | first = Cynthia J. | authorlink =  | title = Casting Shadows: The Adams Memorial and Its Doubles | journal = American Art | volume =14  | issue =2 | pages = 2‚Äì25  | publisher = Smithsonian American Art Museum  | date = Summer 2000  | url =  | doi =  10.1086/424354| id =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is of a somber seated figure in a cowl or shroud.

==History==
Beginning with its installation in 1926, the replica was surrounded by many [[urban legends]], principally that someone spending a night in its lap would be haunted by the ghosts of those buried there; that the spirits of individuals buried at Druid Ridge would annually convene at the statue; that no grass would grow on the ground where the statue's [[shadow]] would lie during the daytime; or that the statue would animate itself during the night, whether by physically moving or by showing glowing red eyes.&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt;

These urban legends led to much unwelcome attention toward the statue; many people were caught breaking into the cemetery at night to visit it, and the pedestal was frequently vandalized. The Agnus family, disturbed by the attention the statue received, donated it to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1967. It sat for many years in storage at the National Museum of American Art (later named the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]) where an authorized recasting of the original Adams Memorial statue now sits.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Adams Memorial; modeled 1886-1891, cast 1969; by Augustus Saint-Gaudens | work =  | publisher =  Smithsonian Museum of American Art | date =  | url =  http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=21528 | doi = | accessdate = 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Aggie was moved from her previous home at the museum to a courtyard behind the [[Dolley Madison House]] on [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] where she currently stands. The bare, blank pedestal remains at the statue's former home at Druid Ridge Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt;

Another statue, similarly called "Black Agnus", is located at Green Mount Cemetery in Montpelier, Vermont. This one is of a man sitting and covered in a shawl, but his head is visible and he is looking up with closed eyes. This statue is copper rather than bronze, so it has a [[Patina|green patina.]]

In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51‚Äì52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Maka≈°|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51‚Äì52}}{{sfn|B√©ghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roma≈Ñczyk, K.

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51‚Äì52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Maka≈°|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51‚Äì52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[L√©on Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|B√©ghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North‚ÄìSouth connection|North‚ÄìSouth railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911‚Äì52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[Andr√© de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to fa√ßadism ===
[[File:Brusselisation in bucharest.jpg|thumb|250px|Brusselization in contemporary [[Bucharest]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}]]
In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51‚Äì52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Maka≈°|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|fa√ßadisme]]}}'' ‚Äî the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[fa√ßade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Maka≈°|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Maka≈°|2011|pp=120}}

Chiniquy''' (30 July 1809 ‚Äì  16 January 1899) was Canadian [[Catholic priest]] who left the Roman Catholic Church and became a Presbyterian minister. He rode the lecture circuit denouncing the Catholic Church. His themes were that it was pagan, that Catholics worship the Virgin Mary, and that its theology is anti-Christian. He warned of plots by the Vatican to take control of the United States by importing Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Germany and France.  He suggested the Vatican was behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln,

==Biography==
Chiniquy was born in 1809 in the  village of [[Kamouraska, Quebec|Kamouraska]], Quebec. He lost his father at an early age and was adopted by his uncle. As a young man, Chiniquy studied to become a Catholic priest at the Petit Seminaire ([[Seminary|Little Seminary]]) in [[Nicolet, Quebec]]. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1833. After his ordination, he served his church in Quebec and later immigrated to [[Illinois]]. During the 1840s, he led a very successful {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} campaign throughout Quebec against alcohol and [[drunkenness]].

In 1855, he was sued by a prominent Catholic layman named Peter Spink in Kankakee, Illinois. After the fall court term, Spink applied for a change of venue to the court in Urbana. [[Abraham Lincoln]] was then hired by Chiniquy to defend him. The spring court action in Urbana was the highest profile libel suit in Lincoln's career.&lt;ref name=serup&gt;{{cite book | last = Serup | first = Paul | title = Who killed Abraham Lincoln? : an investigation of North America's most famous ex-priest's assertion that the Roman Catholic Church was behind the assassination of America's greatest president | publisher = Salmova Press | location = Prince George, B.C | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780981168500 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ended in the fall court session by agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Fenster| first = Julie M. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | title = The Case of Abraham Lincoln | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = | isbn = 978-0-230-60809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiniquy clashed with the Bishop of Chicago, [[Anthony O'Regan]], over the bishop's treatment of Catholics in Chicago, particularly French Canadians. He declared that O'Regan was secretly backing Spink's suit against him. Chiniquy stated that in 1856 O'Regan threatened him with excommunication if he did not go to a new location where the bishop wanted him. Several months later the ''New York Times'' published a pastoral letter from Bishop O'Regan in which O'Regan stated that he had suspended Chiniquy and, since the priest had continued in his normal duties as a priest, the bishop excommunicated him by his letter. Chiniquy vigorously disputed that he had been excommunicated, saying publicly that the bishop was mistaken. Chiniquy left the Roman Catholic Church in 1858.&lt;ref name=serup/&gt; He claimed that the church was [[paganism|pagan]], that [[Roman Catholics]] worship the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], that its theology spoils the [[Gospel]] and that its theology is &lt;!--[[Christianophobia]]--&gt;anti-Christian. &lt;!-- He probably meant having to do with the anti-Christ, not that it increases fear of Christians. Can another editor figure this out? --&gt; He also claimed that the [[Holy See|Vatican]] had planned to take over the United States by importing Catholic [[immigrant]]s from Ireland, Germany and France.

Chiniquy claimed that he was falsely accused by his superiors (and that Abraham Lincoln had come to his rescue), that the [[American Civil War]] was a plot against the United States of America by the Vatican, and that the Vatican was behind the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause, the death of President Lincoln and that Lincoln's assassins were faithful Roman Catholics ultimately serving [[Pope Pius IX]].

After leaving the Catholic Church, Chiniquy dedicated his life to trying to win his fellow French Canadians, as well as others, from Catholicism to the Protestant faith. He wrote a number of books and tracts pointing out his views on the alleged errors in the faith and practises of the Roman Catholic Church. His two most influential works are ''Fifty Years in The Church of Rome''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=New York; Chicago; Toronto|publisher=Fleming H. Revell|last=Chiniquy|first=Charles P|authorlink=Charles Chiniquy|title=Fifty years in the Church of Rome|year=1886|oclc=343196|url=https://archive.org/download/fiftyyearsinchur00chin/fiftyyearsinchur00chin.pdf|accessdate={{date|2013-04-02}}|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsinchur00chin|archivedate={{date|2008-06-02}}|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Priest, The Woman and The Confessional''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iOJ_KRl2IG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0 The Priest, The Woman and The Confessional]''&lt;/ref&gt; These books raised concerns in the United States about the Catholic Church. According to one Canadian biographer, Chiniquy is Canada's best-selling author of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lougheed| first = Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2009 | title = The Controversial Conversion of Charles Chiniquy ''Texts and Studies in Protestant History and Thought in Quebec'' | publisher = Clements Academic | location = | isbn = 978-1-894667-93-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Orange Order]] and said of it "I always found them staunch and true. I consider it a great honour to be an Orangeman. Every time I go on my knees I pray that God may bless them and make them as numerous and bright as the stars of the heaven above."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the Banners: The Story of the ORange Order, pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada on January 16, 1899.

To this day, some of Chiniquy's works are still promoted among Protestants and [[Sola scriptura]] believers. One of his most well known modern day followers is [[Jack Chick]], who created a comic-form adaptation of ''50 Years In The Church of Rome'' called "The Big Betrayal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Chino, CA|publisher=[[Chick Publications]]|last=Chick|first=Jack T|authorlink=Jack T.

==St. Anne Colony==
Chiniquy, then a Roman Catholic priest, left Canada in the wake of a series of scandals. He was offered a fresh start by [[James Oliver Van de Velde]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Bishop of Chicago]], after [[Ignace Bourget]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal|Bishop of Montreal]], asked him to leave in 1851. Chiniquy settled in [[St. Anne, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Roby2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=Ottawa|publisher=National Archives of Canada and National Library of Canada|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]|issn=1709-6812|oclc=463897210|volume=12|year=2000|editor-last=English|editor-first=John|title=Chiniquy, Charles|last=Roby|first=Yves|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6029|accessdate=27 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GBwUMs3b?url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6029|archivedate=27 April 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiniquy was suspended, on {{date|1856-08-19|mdy}}, for public insubordination by Van de Velde's successor, Bishop [[Anthony O'Regan]]. He continued to celebrate Mass and administer the other sacraments and was excommunicated on {{date|1856-09-03|mdy}}. About two years later, on {{date|1858-08-03|mdy}}, O'Regan's successor, Bishop [[James Duggan]], formally reconfirmed his excommunication in St. Anne. Chiniquy then left the {{abbr|RCC|Roman Catholic Church}} and, with many followers, joined the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (PCUSA). He was admitted as a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian minister]] on {{date|1860-02-01|mdy}}.&lt;ref name="Roby2000" /&gt; Within two years, Chiniquy, in trouble with the Presbytery of Chicago over his administration of charity funds and a college, according to Elizabeth Ann Kerr McDougall in the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', sought a new connection in order to avoid an expensive presbytery trial.&lt;ref name="McDougall2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=Ottawa|publisher=National Archives of Canada and National Library of Canada|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]|issn=1709-6812|oclc=463897210|volume=|year=2000|editor-last=English|editor-first=John|title=Kemp, Alexander Ferrie|last=McDougall|first=Elizabeth Ann Kerr|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5621|accessdate=27 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GCVhjaWa?url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5621|archivedate=27 April 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college is identified in the ''Seventh Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Illinois'' as Saviour's College, founded in 1860; it is listed neither in ''Universities and Colleges'' nor ''[[Academy|Academies]] and Seminaries of various grades and courses'' but in the ''Theological Seminaries and Church Schools'' class of institutions. The report states it "is designed to supply the educational wants of the colony brought by Father Chiniquy from Canada to this State, and to prepare men who will be fitted to preach the gospel in the regions whence he came." The report also quotes a description of the school, attributed to correspondence from a Montreal newspaper, unnamed in the report, that people, also unnamed in the report, "examined the [[day school]] or college, as the people there delight to call it" and wrote it had five classes ranging from students learning the [[alphabet]] to students learning the "intricacies of [[French grammar|French]] and [[English grammar]], [[composition (language)|composition]], and the other studies of the school, besides the elements of [[Algebra]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Springfield|publisher=Illinois Journal Printing Office|title=Reports made to the General Assembly of Illinois, at its twenty-sixth session, convened 4 January 1869|year=1869|volume=2|chapter=Seventh Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Illinois. 1867‚Äì1868|pages=vi‚Äìvii, 212‚Äì214, 311‚Äì312

Kemp was chairman of the Synod of the Canada Presbyterian Church committee which examined Chiniquy's admission application.&lt;ref name="McDougall2000" /&gt; According to Kemp, Chiniquy was involved in both presbytery and civil court proceedings connected with the administration of charitable funds and with what Kemp described as an educational institute. This led to the Presbytery of Chicago charging him with unministerial and unchristian conduct.

'''Creative destruction''' (German: ''sch√∂pferische Zerst√∂rung''), sometimes known as '''Schumpeter's gale''', is a concept in [[economics]] which since the 1950s has become most readily identified with the [[Austrians|Austrian]] economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; who derived it from the work of [[Karl Marx]] and popularized it as a theory of [[Innovation economics|economic innovation]] and the [[business cycle]].

According to Schumpeter, the "gale of creative destruction" describes the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one".&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"/&gt; In [[Marxian economic theory]] the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of [[wealth]] under capitalism.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: ''Vernichtung'') implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx1863"/&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx‚Äôs thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below).&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942"&gt;{{cite book

==History==

=== In Marx's thought ===
Although the modern term "creative destruction" is not used explicitly by Marx, it is largely derived from his analyses, particularly in the work of Werner Sombart (whom Engels described as the only German professor who understood Marx's ''Capital''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abram L. |last=Harris |title=Sombart and German (National) Socialism |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=50 |issue=6 |year=1942 |pages=805‚Äì35 [p. 807] |doi=10.1086/255964 |jstor=1826617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Joseph Schumpeter, who discussed at length the origin of the idea in Marx's work (see below).

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of "the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. [...] It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, ''a great part not only of existing production, but also of previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed''. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity ‚Äì the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions. [‚Ä¶] And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by ''enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces''; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A few years later, in the ''Grundrisse'', Marx was writing of "the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation".&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt; In other words, he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These contradictions lead to explosions, cataclysms, crises, in which [...] momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital [...] violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott1978-79"&gt;For further discussion of the concept of creative discussion in the Grundrisse, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = J. E. | title = Marx's "Grundrisse": Vision of Capitalism's Creative Destruction | jstor = 4537475 | journal = Journal of Post Keynesian Economics | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 148‚Äì69 | year = 1978 | doi = 10.2307/4537475| doi-broken-date = 2018-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Theories of Surplus Value'' ("Volume IV" of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1863), Marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of (commodity) values affects either use values or exchange values or both together.&lt;ref name="isbn1-84467-095-3"/&gt; The destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the production-devaluation cycle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale. This is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities. It does not cause the destruction of any use-values. What one loses, the other gains. Values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person. The old capitalists go bankrupt. [...] A large part of the nominal capital of the society, i.e., of the exchange-value of the existing capital, is once for all destroyed, although this very destruction, since it does not affect the use-value, may very much expedite the new reproduction. This is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Social geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] sums up the differences between Marx's usage of these concepts and Schumpeter's: "Both Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter wrote at length on the 'creative-destructive' tendencies inherent in capitalism. While Marx clearly admired capitalism's creativity he [...] strongly emphasised its self-destructiveness. The Schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalism's endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business".&lt;ref name="isbn1-84668-308-4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey, David|authorlink=David Harvey (geographer)|title=The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|year=2010|page=46|isbn=978-1-84668-308-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ww1dPgAACAAJ|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other early usage ===
[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Tropenmuseum - Shiva Nataraja (6274-1).jpg|thumb|In [[Hinduism]], the god [[Shiva]] is simultaneously destroyer and creator, portrayed as ''[[Shiva Nataraja]]'' (Lord of the Dance), which is proposed as the source of the Western notion of "creative destruction".&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt;]]
In the [[Origin of Species]], which was published in 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote that the "extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms."  One notable exception to this rule is how the extinction of the dinosaurs facilitated the [[adaptive radiation]] of mammals.  In this case creation was the consequence, rather than the cause, of destruction.    

In philosophical terms, the concept of "creative destruction" is close to [[Hegel]]¬¥s concept of [[Aufheben|sublation]]. In German economic discourse it was taken up from Marx's writings by [[Werner Sombart]], particularly in his 1913 text ''Krieg und Kapitalismus'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sombart |first=W. |authorlink=Werner Sombart |year=1913 |title=Krieg und Kapitalismus |trans-title=War and Capitalism |location=Leipzig |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeLrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, however, ''from destruction a new spirit of creation arises;'' the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life... forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood, forced the use of coal for heating, forced the invention of coke for the production of iron.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hugo Reinert has argued that Sombart's formulation of the concept was influenced by [[Eastern mysticism]], specifically the image of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; Conceivably this influence passed from [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who brought Hindu thought to German philosophy in his ''Philosophy of Human History'' (Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit) (Herder 1790‚Äì92), specifically volume III, pp.&amp;nbsp;41‚Äì64.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; via [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Friedrich Maier]] through [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]¬¥s writings. Nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of [[Dionysus]], a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time "destructively creative" and "creatively destructive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following passage from ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887), Nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction, such that every creative act has its destructive consequence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? How much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered, how many lies have had to be sanctified, how many consciences disturbed, how much "God" sacrificed every time? If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed: that is the law ‚Äì let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled! ‚Äì [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other nineteenth-century formulations of this idea include Russian [[anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who wrote in 1842, "The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany, From the Notebooks of a Frenchman], October 1842&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed "destructive creation",{{Original research inline|date=July 2014}} and differs sharply from Marx's and Schumpeter's formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents (as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both Marx and Schumpeter).

=={{Anchor|Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter}}Association with Joseph Schumpeter==
The expression "creative destruction" was popularized by and is most associated with Joseph Schumpeter, particularly in his book ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'', first published in 1942. Already in his 1939 book ''Business Cycles'', he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of [[Nikolai Kondratieff]] and his [[Kondratiev wave|long-wave]] cycle which Schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Crumbling Walls"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in ''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', Schumpeter introduced the term "creative destruction", which he explicitly derived from Marxist thought (analysed extensively in Part I of the book) and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Capitalism [...] is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary. [...] The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers‚Äô goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.&lt;p&gt;[...] The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure ''from within'', incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.&lt;p&gt;[... Capitalism requires] the perennial gale of Creative Destruction.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"&gt;{{cite book

In Schumpeter's vision of capitalism, innovative entry by [[entrepreneurs]] was the disruptive force that sustained [[economic growth]], even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of [[monopoly]] power derived from previous technological, organizational, regulatory, and economic paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Gregory |last=Sidak |first2=David J. |last2=Teece |title=Dynamic Competition in Antitrust Law |journal=[[Journal of Competition Law &amp; Economics]] |year=2009 |volume=5  |issue=4 |pages=581‚Äì631 [p. 604] |doi=10.1093/joclec/nhp024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process, seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalism's own institutional frameworks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. [... T]he capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept, making it central to his economic theory, and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the so-called Austrian School of free-market economic thought.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

{{Quote|These economic facts have certain social consequences. As the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on "social" grounds, it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process. We have already spoken of it as a leveling process. More aptly, we may now describe these results as an instance of what [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] called "[[circulation of elite|the circulation of elites]]." Wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands. It passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value, now on this, now on that specific resource, engendering capital gains and losses. The owners of wealth, we might say with Schumpeter, are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train: They are always there but are never for long the same people.|2=[[Ludwig Lachmann]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=97&amp;chapter=3326&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 The Market Economy and the Distribution of Wealth]}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement, it can also constitute a limit in its own right, as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form. As capital cannot abide a limit to profitability, ever more frantic forms of "[[time-space compression]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAGeva8_ElMC |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=240‚Äì323 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity: an Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; (increased speed of turnover, innovation of ever faster transport and communications' infrastructure, "flexible accumulation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |page=147 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ensue, often impelling technological innovation. Such innovation, however, is a double-edged sword:

{{Quote|The effect of continuous innovation [...] is to devalue, if not destroy, past investments and labour skills. ''Creative destruction'' is embedded within the circulation of capital itself. Innovation exacerbates instability, insecurity, and in the end, becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis. [...] The struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities. New product lines are opened up, and that means the creation of new wants and needs. Capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others [...]. The result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability, as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another, leaving whole sectors devastated [...]. The drive to relocate to more advantageous places (the geographical movement of both capital and labour) periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour, adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity. The resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension, as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to "the twinkling of an eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=105‚Äì06 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of time-space compression, allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another, devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations. Hence, in this continual process of creative destruction, capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises, but merely "moves them around geographically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

=== Marshall Berman ===
In his 1987 book ''All That is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity'',&lt;ref name="isbn0-86091-785-1" /&gt; particularly in the chapter entitled "Innovative Self-Destruction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;98‚Äì104), [[Marshall Berman]] provides a reading of Marxist "creative destruction" to explain key processes at work within modernity. The title of the book is taken from a well-known passage from ''The Communist Manifesto''. Berman elaborates this into something of a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' which has profound social and cultural consequences:

{{Quote|The truth of the matter, as Marx sees, is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down. "All that is solid"‚Äîfrom the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them, to the men and women who work the machines, to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in, to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers, to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all‚Äîall these are made to be broken tomorrow, smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved, so they can be recycled or replaced next week, and the whole process can go on again and again, hopefully forever, in ever more profitable forms. The pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all, that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate. Even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable, capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete, closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to "Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Berman |first=Marshall |title=All That is Solid Melts into Air |year=1987 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Berman emphasizes Marx's perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalism's immense creative forces, and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity.

=== Manuel Castells ===
The sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], in his trilogy on ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture]]'' (the first volume of which, ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture#The Rise of the Network Society|The Rise of the Network Society]]'', appeared in 1996),&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22140-9" /&gt; reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe, while divesting from others, using the new paradigm of "informational networks". In the era of globalization, capitalism is characterized by near-instantaneous flow, creating a new spatial dimension, "the [[space of flows]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |pages=376‚Äì428}}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity, this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks. Indeed, the new spatial form of the [[megacity|mega-city]] or megalopolis, is defined by Castells as having the contradictory quality of being "globally connected and locally disconnected, physically and socially".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction:

{{Quote|The "spirit of informationalism" is the culture of "creative destruction" accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals. Schumpeter meets [[Max Weber|Weber]] in the cyberspace of the network enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=199}} For further discussion, see also {{Cite journal

Developing the Schumpeterian legacy, the school of the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] of the [[University of Sussex]] has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring, in particular, how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change. [[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and [[Carlota Perez]] have developed these insights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and Francisco Lou√ßa, ''As Time Goes By: From the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution'' (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001). [[Carlota Perez]], ''Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages'', (Cheltenham  Glos, Edward Elgar, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Daniele Archibugi]] and Andrea Filippetti have associated the 2008 economic crisis to the slow-down of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies (ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi and Andrea Filippetti, [https://www.routledge.com/Innovation-and-Economic-Crisis-Lessons-and-Prospects-from-the-Economic/Archibugi-Filippetti/p/book/9780415602280 ''Innovation and Economic Crisis Lessons and Prospects from the Economic Downturn''], (London, Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Using as a metaphor the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', Archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in 1982, all those associated to ICTs have become part of our everyday life. But, on the contrary, none of those in the field of Biotech have been fully commercialized. A new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557335 Blade Runner Economics: Will Innovation Lead the Economic Recovery?], SSRN Papers 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices. We should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology. ICTs have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life: they have generated jobs and profits, but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world.

In 1992, the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by [[Philippe Aghion]] and [[Peter Howitt (economist)|Peter Howitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aghion |first=Philippe |last2=Howitt |first2= Peter |title=A Model of Growth Through Creative Destruction |journal=Econometrica |year=1992 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=323‚Äì51 |jstor=2951599 |doi=10.2307/2951599 |hdl=1721.1/63839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving an alternative model of [[Endogenous growth theory|endogenous growth]] compared to [[Paul Romer]]'s expanding varieties model.

In 1995, [[Harvard Business School]] authors [[Richard L. Nolan]] and David C. Croson released ''Creative Destruction:  A Six-Stage Process for Transforming the Organization.''  The book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources, which could then be reinvested to create [[competitive advantage]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

More recently, the idea of "creative destruction" was utilized by Max Page in his 1999 book, ''The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900‚Äì1940.''  The book traces [[Manhattan]]'s constant reinvention, often at the expense of preserving a concrete past. Describing this process as "creative destruction," Page describes the complex historical circumstances, economics, social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in Manhattan's cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Max|title=The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900‚Äì1940|year=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-64468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Max Page, others have used the term ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization. T.C. Chang and Shirlena Huang referenced ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù in their paper ''Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative Destruction at the [[Singapore River]].'' The authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=T.C.|author2=Shirlena Huang|title=Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative destruction at the Singapore River|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|date=December 2005|volume=46|issue=3|pages=267‚Äì80|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8373.2005.00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosemary Wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central Paris, France known as [[Les Halles]]. Les Halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century. Ultimately, in 1971, the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down. In their place, now stand a hub for trains, subways and buses. Les Halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in France and the controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakeman|first=Rosemary|title=Fascinating Les Halles|journal=French Politics, Culture &amp; Society|date=Summer 2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=46‚Äì72|doi=10.3167/fpcs.2007.250205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù has been applied to the arts. Alan Ackerman and Martin Puncher (2006) edited a collection of essays under the title ''Against Theater: Creative destruction on the modernist stage.'' They detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in [[theater]] as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics. They speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of [[anti-theatricality]], straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions, which might be considered avant-garde staging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Alan|title=Against Theater|year=2006|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4039-4491-7|pages=1‚Äì17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book, ''Still the New World, American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction'', [[Philip Fisher (author)|Philip Fisher]] analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century, including the works of such authors as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[Henry James]], among others. Fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Still the New World: American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction|last=Fisher|first=Philip|publisher=Harvard University Press, Second Edition|year=1999|isbn=978-0674004092|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoconservative]] author [[Michael Ledeen]] argued in his 2002 book ''The War Against the Terror Masters'' that America is a revolutionary nation, undoing traditional societies: "Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law." His characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from [[paleoconservative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Laughland |first=John |last=Laughland |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/jun/30/00013/ |title=Flirting with Fascism. Neocon theorist Michael Ledeen draws more from Italian fascism than from the American Right |journal=American Conservative |date=June 30, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development. The connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by Stuart L. Hart and Mark B. Milstein in their 1999 article ''Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart |last=Hart |first2=Mark |last2=Milstein |title=Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries |journal=Sloan Management Review |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=23‚Äì33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability. (An argument which they would later on strengthen in their 2003 article ''Creating Sustainable Value''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |first2=Mark B. |last2=Milstein |title=Creating Sustainable Value |journal=Academy of Management Executive |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=56‚Äì67 |doi=10.5465/AME.2003.10025194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, with ''Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |title=Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability |journal=Research Technology Management |volume=48 |issue=5 |year=2005 |pages=21‚Äì27 |doi=10.1080/08956308.2005.11657334}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Andrea L. Larson agreed with this vision a year later in ''Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrea L. |last=Larson |title=Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens |journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |volume=9 |year=2000 |pages=304‚Äì17 |doi=10.1002/1099-0836(200009/10)9:5&lt;304::AID-BSE255&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive improvement based on sustainability. In 2005, James Hartshorn (et al.) emphasized the opportunities for sustainable, disruptive improvement in the construction industry in his article ''Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James |last=Hartshorn |first2=Michael |last2=Maher |first3=Jack |last3=Crooks |first4=Richard |last4=Stahl |first5=Zo√´ |last5=Bond |title=Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=170‚Äì80 |doi=10.1139/l04-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative name==
The following text appears to be the source of the phrase "Schumpeter's Gale" to refer to creative destruction:

{{quote|The opening up of new markets and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as US Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one ... [The process] must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.|Joseph Schumpeter|''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', 1942}}

==In popular culture==
The film ''[[Other People's Money]]'' (1991) provides contrasting views of creative destruction, presented in two speeches regarding the takeover of a publicly traded wire and cable company in a small New England town. One speech is by a [[corporate raider]], and the other is given by the company CEO, who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth M.

The '''Dacianos''' formed the mythical group of European wanderers, said to be a caste of [[Romani people|gypsies]], who specialised in child-stealing and the manufacture of human freaks.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Mike (1984) ''The World's Most Fantastic Freaks'', pp 50,51, OCTOPUS BOOKS, {{ISBN|0-7064-2145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also referred to as a criminal society that lasted until the 18th century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Police Files: The Spokane Experience 1853-1995|last=Kienholz|first=M|publisher=Millwood Publishing|year=1999|isbn=0870622862|location=Spokane, Washington|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; maiming children so they can be sold as professional beggars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/14576/WA303_26570_2003-88_APH-03_o.pdf|title=Child abuse in Polish Towns|last=Karpi≈Ñski|first=Andrzej|date=|website=Digital Repository of Scientific Institutes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The ''Dacianos'' are cited to have inhabited parts of [[Spain]] for several hundred years and the term itself, along with ''gitanos,'' is a Spanish name for gypsies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were also identified as the ''Comprachicos'' or ''Comprapequenos'' in Victor Hugo's ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''. Hugo claimed that traces of this group can be found in the penal laws of Spain and [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man who Laughs, Volume 1|last=Hugo|first=Victor|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|year=1892|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their origin is linked to gypsies called the [[Dacians]], who settled [[Dacia]], a Roman province and later a kingdom in present-day Hungary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another theory claims that the ''Dacianos'' may have come from Dacca, a province of Pakistan.

==Surat al-Kahf (surah 18), verses 83-101 ==
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Caspian Gates in [[Derbent]], Russia, part of the defence systems built by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns, often identified with the Gates of Alexander]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn is related in chapter 18 ([[Surat al-Kahf]], "The Cave") of the Quran. This chapter was revealed to Muhammad when his tribe, Quraysh, sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them "about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story". "If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit." (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope="row"|18:83-98]]).

The verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhul-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:

==The Alexander Romance and Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these legends the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements of the legend are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The [[Alexander Romance]] went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}

Alexander was already known as "the two-horned one" in these early legends.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The reasons for this are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glass√©|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glass√©|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

==Dhul Qarnayn in later literature==

Dhul-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Ab≈´ ·∏§ƒÅmid Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-GhazƒÅlƒ´, 1058‚Äì1111) wrote of how Dhul-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (JalƒÅl ad-Dƒ´n Muhammad R≈´mƒ´, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhul Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the "mother" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhul Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhul Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}

The Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,&lt;ref&gt;Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60&lt;/ref&gt; from Iskandar Zulkarnain,&lt;ref name="(Malaysia)1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu &amp; kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&amp;dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.&lt;ref name="TasaiDjamari2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S.

==People identified with Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:100_manat._T√ºrkmenistan,_2009_a.jpg|thumb|[[Oghuz Khan]] pictured with two horns as Zulqarnayn on a 100 [[Turkmenistan]] [[Turkmenistan manat|manat]] banknote.]]
{{also|Cyrus the Great in the Quran}}
Muslim and other commentators have identified Dhul Qarnayn with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]],{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} but some have objected that this cannot be so: Alexander lived only a short time, whereas Dhul-Qarnayn lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Alexander behaved very badly while Dhul-Qarnayn was a paragon; and Dhul-Qarnayn worshiped [[Allah|only one god]], while Alexander worshiped many.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.2}} Other candidates have been suggested:

*[[Cyrus the Great]], the 6th century BCE [[Achaemenid Persia]]n conqueror.
*[[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr|Imru'l-Qays]] (died 328 CE), a prince of the [[Lakhmids]] of southern Mesopotamia, an ally first of Persia and then of Rome, celebrated in romance for his exploits.{{sfn|Ball|2002|p=97-98}}

'''''Geistesgeschichte''''' (from German ''[[Geist]]'', "spirit" [here connoting the [[metaphysical]] realm, in contradistinction to the material], and ''Geschichte'', "history", "science") is a concept in the [[history of ideas]] denoting the branch of study concerned with the ''undercurrents'' of cultural manifestations, within the history of a people, that are peculiar to a specific timeframe.

The term is a largely untranslatable term, sometimes translated as "intellectual history"&lt;ref&gt;Fugmann, Nicole. 1997. "Contemporary Editorial Theory and the Transvaluation of Postmodern Critique." ''Text'' 10: 15‚Äì30, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bontempelli, Pier Carlo. 2004. ''Knowledge, Power, and Discipline: German Studies and National Identity.'' Transl. Gabriele Poole. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; or "history of ideas",&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, Paul. 1997. "Introduction." Peter Draper (ed.), ''Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner'', (pp. 1‚Äì28). Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strelka, Joseph. "On German ''Geistesgeschichte'' and Its Impact on Comparative Literature." Fran√ßois Jost (ed.), ''Aesthetics and the Literature of Ideas'', (pp. 44‚Äì52) . Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes used synonymously with ''Problemgeschichte''.  The branch of study it denotes is often seen as having been inspired by the type of work done by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and his followers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15772">{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}

The process that has been described as the '''genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil''' began with the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], when [[Pedro √Ålvares Cabral]] made landfall in what is now the country of Brazil in 1500. This started the process that led to the depopulation of the [[indigenous peoples in Brazil]], because of disease and violent treatment by European settlers, and their gradual replacement with colonists from Europe and Africa. This process has been described as a genocide, and continues into the modern era with the ongoing destruction of indigenous peoples of the Amazonian region.&lt;ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherrer 2003 p294" /&gt;

Over eighty indigenous tribes were destroyed between 1900 and 1957, and the overall indigenous population declined by over eighty percent, from over one million to around two hundred thousand.&lt;ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" /&gt;  The [[Constitution|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognises indigenous peoples' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their "traditional lands", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;Federal Constitution of Brazil. [http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleVIII.html Chapter VII Article 231].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, Brazil's indigenous people still face a number of external threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="US DoS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Human Rights Report: Brazil|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119150.htm|publisher=United States Department of State: Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of demarcation is slow‚Äîoften involving protracted legal battles‚Äîand [[Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio|FUNAI]] do not have sufficient resources to enforce the legal protection on indigenous land.&lt;ref name="ISA Intro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Lands &gt; Introduction &gt; About Lands|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/c/terras-indigenas/introducao/o-que-sao-terras-indigenas|work=Povos Ind√≠genas no Brasil|publisher=Instituo Socioambiental (ISA)|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US DoS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borges|first=Beto|last2=Combrisson|first2=Gilles|title=Indigenous Rights in Brazil: Stagnation to Political Impasse|url=http://saiic.nativeweb.org/brazil.html|publisher=South and Meso American Indian Rights Center|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartzman|first=Stephan|last2=Val√©ria Ara√∫jo|first2=Ana|last3=Pankarar√∫|first3=Paulo|title=Brazil: The Legal Battle Over Indigenous Land Rights|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|year=1996|volume=29|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=95702149|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian Indians 'win land case'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7774895.stm|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s there has been a boom in the exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging and cattle ranching, posing a severe threat to the region's indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for indigenous peoples' traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations and spread disease.&lt;ref name="US DoS" /&gt; Peoples such as the [[Akuntsu]] and [[Kano√™]] have been brought to the brink of extinction within the last three decades.&lt;ref name="ISA Akuntsu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction &gt; Akuntsu|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/akuntsu|work=Povos Ind√≠genas no Brasil|accessdate=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISA Kanoe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction &gt; Kano√™|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/kanoe|work=Povos Ind√≠genas no Brasil|accessdate=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2012, the national indigenous peoples association from Brazil APIB submitted to the United Nation a human rights  document with complaints about new proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2866 |title=English version of human rights complaint document submitted to the United Nations by the National Indigenous Peoples Organization from Brazil (APIB) |publisher=Earth Peoples |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed due to the ongoing persecution of the indigenous peoples in Brazil, and international pressure has been brought to bear on the state after the release of the [[Figueiredo Report]] which documented massive human rights violations.

The abuses have been described as [[genocide]], [[ethnocide]] and [[cultural genocide]].

== Affected tribes ==
{{See|List of extinct indigenous peoples of Brazil}}

In the 1940s the state and the [[Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio|Indian Protection Service]] (IPS) forcibly relocated the [[Aikan√£]], [[Kan√¥c]], [[Kwaza people|Kwaz√°]] and [[Salam√°i]] tribes to work on rubber plantations. During the journey many of the indigenous peoples starved to death, those who survived the journey were placed in an IPS settlement called Posto Ricardo Franco. These actions resulted in the near extinction of the Kan√¥c tribe.&lt;ref name="Van Der Voort 2004 p5" /&gt;

The ethnocide of the Yanomami has been well documented, there are an estimated nine thousand currently living in Brazil in the Upper Orinoco drainage and a further fifteen thousand in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013 p628" /&gt; The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.&lt;ref name="Kopenawa Yanomami 2013" /&gt;

The [[Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau]], whose territory has been protected by law since 1991, saw an influx of an estimated 800 people in 2007. The tribal leaders met with the civil authorities and demanded the trespassers be evicted. This tribe, initially contacted in 1981, saw a severe decline in population after disease was introduced by settlers and miners. Their numbers are now estimated at a few hundred.&lt;ref name="Survival International 2007" /&gt;

== Portuguese colonization ==

During the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], Cabral made landfall off the atlantic coast. Over the following decade the indigenous [[Tup√≠ people|Tup√≠]], [[Tapuya]] and other tribes which lived along the coast suffered large depopulation due to disease and violence. A process of miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Ribeiro ‚Äì O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that of the 2.5 million indigenous peoples who had lived in the region which now comprises Brazil, less than 10 per cent survived to the 1600s.&lt;ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /&gt; The primarily reason for depopulation was diseases such as smallpox that advanced far beyond movement of European settlers.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=''BBC Four''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State reaction ==

In 1952 Brazil ratified the [[Genocide Convention|genocide convention]] and incorporated into their penal laws [[Genocide Convention#Definition of_genocide|article II]] of the convention.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /&gt; While the statute was being drafted, Brazil argued against the inclusion of cultural genocide, claiming that some minority groups may use it to oppose the normal assimilation which occurs in a new country. According to professor of law at [[Vanderbilt University]] Larry May, the argument put forward by Brazil was significant, but cultural genocide should not be cast aside, and this type of genocide should be included within the definition of genocide.&lt;ref name="May 2010 p103" /&gt;

In 1967 public prosecutor Jader de Figueiredo Correia, submitted the Figueiredo Report to the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]] which was then ruling the country. The report, which ran seven thousand pages, remained hidden for over forty years. Its release caused an international furore. The rediscovered documents are being examined by the [[National Truth Commission]] which has been tasked with the investigations of human rights violations which occurred in the periods 1947 through to 1988. The report reveals that the IPS had enslaved indigenous people, tortured children and stolen land. The Truth Commission is of the opinion that entire tribes in [[Maranh√£o]] were completely eradicated and in [[Mato Grosso]], an attack on thirty [[Cinta Larga people|Cintur√£o Largo]] left only two survivors. The report also states that landowners and members of the IPS had entered isolated villages and deliberately introduced [[smallpox]]. Of the one hundred and thirty four people accused in the report the state has as yet not tried a single one.&lt;ref name="Watts 19 May 2013" /&gt; The report also detailed instances of mass killings, rapes, and torture. Figueiredo stated that the actions of the IPS had left the indigenous peoples near extinction. The state abolished the IPS following the release of the report. The [[Red Cross]] launched an investigation after further allegations of [[ethnic cleansing]] were made after the IPS had been replaced.&lt;ref name="Garfield 2001 p143" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren 2001 p84" /&gt;

In 1992 a group who had been prospecting for gold were tried for the attempted genocide of the Yanomami tribe. A report from an anthropologist, which was submitted as evidence during the trial, stated that the prospectors' entry into Yanomami territory had an adverse effect on their lives, as the prospectors carried diseases. They had also contaminated the rivers which the Yanomami used as a source of food.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /&gt; The UN reported that thousands of the Yanomami have been killed as the Brazilian government failed to enforce the law, and that even after though the Yanomami peoples territory had been demarcated the state had not provided the necessary resources to stop the illegal incursion of gold prospectors. These prospectors have caused massive forest fires which have led to the destruction of extensive areas of both croplands and rainforest.&lt;ref name="Travis 2013 pp147-148" /&gt;

== International reaction ==

At the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in Brazil the [[Kari-Oka Declaration]] and the [[Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter]] were presented by the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world. The Kari-Oka Declaration states "We continue to maintain our rights as peoples despite centuries of deprivation, assimilation and genocide". The declaration also asserted that the genocide convention must be amended so as to include the genocide of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Totten 2010 p4" /&gt; The [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs]] (IWGIA) was founded in 1968 in response to the genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil and [[Paraguay]], and in 1969 [[Survival International]] was founded in London as a response to the atrocities, theft of land and genocide occurring in the [[Amaz√¥nia Legal|Brazilian Amazon]]. In 1972 anthropologists from [[Harvard university]] founded [[Cultural survival]].&lt;ref name="Morgan 2011 p65" /&gt;

The World Bank has been subject to criticism over loans which have been used to help fund the dislocation of indigenous peoples and environmental destruction. The Polonoreste project caused  wholesale [[Deforestation in Brazil|deforestation]], ecological damage on a wide scale, as well as the forced relocation of indigenous communities. The project led to an international campaign which resulted in the World Bank suspending loans.&lt;ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" /&gt;

The '''great man theory''' is a 19th-century idea according to which [[philosophy of history|history]] can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or [[hero]]es; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal [[charisma]], [[intelligence]], [[wisdom]], or political skill used their [[power (philosophy)|power]] in a way that had a decisive historical impact. The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer [[Thomas Carlyle]], but in 1860 [[Herbert Spencer]] formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Cannero"&gt;[[Robert L. Carneiro]] "[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_2/5_2_2.pdf Herbert Spencer as an Anthropologist]" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', vol. 5, 1981, pp. 171‚Äì72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rives La Monte ''Socialism: Positive and Negative'', Chicago: [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company]], 1912, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook"&gt;[[Sidney Hook]] (1950) ''The Hero in History'', New York: [[Humanities Press]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Carlyle stated that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carlyle, "The Hero as Divinity" in: ''Heroes and Hero-Worship '' (1840).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CultLit&gt;[[Hirsch, E.D.]] ''[http://www.bartleby.com/59/17/greatmantheo.html The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Third Edition)]'', [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], Boston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book [[On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History|''On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History'']], Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions of "heroes", giving detailed analysis of the influence of several such men (including [[Muhammad]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Rousseau]], [[Pericles]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Richard Wagner]]). Carlyle also felt that the study of great men was "profitable" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's true nature.&lt;ref name=Carlyle&gt;Carlyle, Thomas. ''[https://www.questia.com/read/1444983# On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History]'', Fredrick A. Stokes &amp; Brother, New York, 1888. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

American scholar [[Frederick Adams Woods]] supported the great man theory in his work ''The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, F. A. 1913. The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History. New York, NY: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.

This theory is usually contrasted with "[[history from below]]", which emphasizes the life of the masses over the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman "[[Migrations Period]]" of European History is compiled under the biography of [[Attila the Hun]]. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as [[Leon Bloy]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]],  [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]] and [[Max Weber]],&lt;ref&gt;As to Hegel and Nietzsche: Edelstein, Alan (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=enzisDOv4jUC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji7dji45TYAhUuSt8KHS7KArwQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Man%20Theory%22%20heroic%20history&amp;f=false ''Everybody is Sitting on the Curb: How and why America's Heroes Disappeared''] Greenwood. {{isbn|9780275953645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As to Kierkegaard: Evjen, John Oluf (1938) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LRz5Rihgyb4C&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history+Kierkegaard&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Kierkegaard ''The Life of J. H. W. Stuckenberg: Theologian, Philosopher, Sociologist, Friend of Humanity''] Luther Free Church Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As to Spengler, Nietsche, Boy and Weber: Saul, John Ralston (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8NIYDjTZwn4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history+Spengler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlyvn05ZTYAhWwSd8KHevGB9wQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Spengler&amp;f=false ''The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense''] New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 58 {{isbn|9781476718941}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it fell out of favor after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'', Nietzsche writes that "the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nietzsche and Antiquity: His Reaction and Response to the Classical Tradition|author=Bishop, P.|date=2004|publisher=Camden House|isbn=9781571132826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn3GBIA7wUYC|page=94|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Kierkegaard writes that "to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the pedestrian‚Äîthat only these knights of faith can do‚Äîthis is the one and only prodigy."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S√∏ren. ''Fear and Trembling''. Preliminary Expectoration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel, proceeding from [[Providentialism |providentialist]] theory, argued that "what is real is reasonable" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel wrote: "Such are great historical men‚Äîwhose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. W. F. [1837].  Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree (New York: Dover, 1956), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]] was a contemporary critic of Carlyle's great man theory.]]

One of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man theory was [[Herbert Spencer]], who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was a hopelessly primitive, childish, and unscientific position.&lt;ref name=HeroMyths&gt;Segal, Robert A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JbE5UxcCr10C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22herbert+spencer%22+%22genesis+of+the+great+man%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9Y0ClaQ1gQ&amp;sig=cacRypZdX1McozPwmBuTDwJBqoU#PPA3,M1  Hero Myths]'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that the men Carlyle called "great men" were merely products of their social environment:

{{quote|You must admit that the genesis of a great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown.&amp;nbsp;... Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.|Herbert Spencer, ''The Study of Sociology''&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756 The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only ''history's slaves'' realizing the decree of Providence.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, L. 2010. War and Peace. Oxford, MA: Oxford University Press Bk. IX, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] in his lecture "Great Men and Their Environment"&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 2005 [1880]. Great Men and Their Environment. Kila, MT: Kessinger Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; underlined the importance of the Great Man's congruence with the surroundings (in the broad sense), though his ultimate point was that environments and individuals shape each other reciprocally, just as environments and individual members of animal species do according to [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] theory.

Among modern critics of the theory, one, [[Sidney Hook]], is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book ''The Hero in History'' is devoted to the role of the [[hero]] and in history and influence of the outstanding [[person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1943. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Grinin]]  defines a historical figure (a great man) thus:
{{quote|Owing to his personal features, or to a chance, or to his social standing, or to the peculiarity of the epoch, an individual by the very fact of his existence, by his ideas or actions (or inaction) directly or indirectly, during his lifetime or after his death may have such an influence upon his own or another society which can be recognized significant as he left a noticeable mark (positive, negative or unambiguous) in history and in the further development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/ "The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration"]. ''Social Evolution &amp; History'', Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95‚Äì136). pp. 116‚Äì17.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So, he concludes that the role of great man depends on a number of factors, not on none at all.

'''Historism''' is a philosophical and historiographical theory, founded in 19th-century&lt;ref name="Spirkin" /&gt; [[Germany]] (as ''Historismus'') and especially influential in 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]. In those times there was not a single natural, humanitarian or philosophical science that would not reflect, in one way or another, the historical type of thought (cf. [[comparative historical linguistics]] etc.).&lt;ref name="Spirkin" /&gt; It pronounces the [[historicity]] of humanity and its binding to tradition.

Historist [[historiography]] rejects historical [[teleology]] and bases its explanations of historical phenomena on sympathy and understanding (see [[Hermeneutics]]) for the events, acting persons, and [[historical period]]s. The historist approach takes to its extreme limits the common observation that human institutions (language, Art, religion, law, State) are subject to perpetual change.&lt;ref name="CrDSoc"&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[Fran√ßois Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], Routledge, 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historism'' is not to be confused with ''[[historicism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Historicism in the sense given to it by Karl Popper, namely the search for historical laws.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless the English habits of using both words are very similar. (The term ''historism'' is sometimes reserved to identify the specific current called ''Historismus'' in the tradition of German philosophy and historiography.)&lt;ref name="CrDSoc"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Because of the power held on the [[social sciences]] by [[logical positivism]], historism or historicism is deemed unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990), ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'', Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]], one of the most distinguished critics of historicism, criticized historism, too. He differentiated between both phenomena as follows: The term ''historicism'' is used in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' to describe ‚Äúan approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Routledge, 1993, p. 3 (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Popper wrote with reference to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. By ''historism'' on the contrary, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits. ''Historism'' does not aim for the 'laws' of history, but premises the individuality of each historical situation.

On the basis of Popper's definitions, the historian [[Stefan Berger]] proposes as a proper word usage: {{"|I deliberately use the term ‚Äòhistorism‚Äô (and ‚Äòhistorist‚Äô) rather than ‚Äòhistoricism‚Äô (and ‚Äòhistoricist‚Äô). Whereas ‚Äòhistorism‚Äô (in German, ''Historismus''), as represented by [[Leopold von Ranke]], can be seen as an evolutionary, reformist concept which understands all political order as historically developed and grown, ‚Äòhistoricism‚Äô (''Historizismus''), as defined and rejected by Karl Popper, is based on the notion that history develops according to predetermined laws towards a particular end. The English language, by using only one term for those different concepts, tends to conflate the two. Hence I suggest using two separate terms in analogy to the German language.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Berger, "[http://www.perspectivia.net/content/publikationen/ghi-bulletin/2001-23-1/0021-0033/at_download/document Stefan Berger responds to Ulrich Muhlack]". In: Bulletin of the German Historical Institute London, Volume XXIII, No. 1, May 2001, pp. 21‚Äì33, here p. 28f. (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable exponents==
Notable exponents of historism were primarily the German 19th-century historians [[Leopold von Ranke]]&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2011, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Gustav Droysen]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cheyne, [[John Worrall (philosopher)|John Worrall]] (eds.), ''Rationality and Reality: Conversations with Alan Musgrave'', Springer 2006, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]],&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2014, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].&lt;ref&gt;Koslowski 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dilthey was influenced by Ranke.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"/&gt; The jurists [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and [[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn]] were strongly influenced by the ideas of historism and founded the [[German Historical School|German Historical School of Law]]. The Italian philosopher and historian [[Benedetto Croce]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin Headlam Wells, Glenn Burgess, Rowland Wymer (eds.), ''Neo-historicism: Studies in Renaissance Literature, History, and Politics'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and his British colleague [[R. G. Collingwood|Robin George Collingwood]]&lt;ref name="vdD"&gt;Collingwood himself used the term "historicism"‚Äîa term he apparently coined‚Äîto describe his approach‚Äîfor example in his 'Ruskin's Philosophy', lecture delivered to the Ruskin Centenary Conference Exhibition, [[Coniston, Cumbria]] (see Jan van der Dussen, ''History as a Science: The Philosophy of R.G. Collingwood'', Springer, 2012, p. 49)‚Äî, but some later historiographers describe him as a proponent of "historism," in accordance with the current meaning of the term in English (see F. R. Ankersmit, ''Sublime Historical Experience'', Stanford University Press, 2005, p. 404).&lt;/ref&gt; were important European exponents of historism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Collingwood was influenced by Dilthey.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p. 27].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Naugle, [http://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/collingwood.pdf "R. G. Collingwood and the Hermeneutic Tradition"], 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranke's arguments can be viewed as an antidote to the lawlike and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approaches common in [[sociology]] and most other [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace and Gach 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p. 14].&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of historism has a universal methodological significance in [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Spirkin"&gt;{{citation |year= 1990  |author= Alexander Spirkin  |authorlink= Alexander Spirkin  |author2= Sergei Syrovatkin (translator) |title= Fundamentals of Philosophy.  |place= [[Moscow]]  |publisher= [[Progress Publishers]]  |isbn= 978-5-01-002582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfPhilosophy_913 |accessdate= 15 January 2011 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published in 1988, as ‚Äú–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ–∏–∏‚Äù }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} The essence of this principle, in brief, is

Lenin, ''Collected Works'', Vol. 29, [[Progress Publishers]], Moscow, 1972, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Georg G. Iggers]] is one of the most important critical authors on historism. His book ''The German Conception of History: The National Tradition of Historical Thought from Herder to the Present'', first published in 1968 (by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, Ct.) is a "classic‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Berger 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; among critiques of historism.

Another critique is presented by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose essay ''Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie f√ºr das Leben'' (''On the Use and Abuse of History for Life'', 1874; see ''[[The Untimely Meditations]]'') denounces ‚Äúa malignant historical fever‚Äù. Nietzsche contends that the historians of his times, the historists, damaged the powers of human life by relegating it to the past instead of opening it to the future. For this reason, he calls for a return, beyond historism, to humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche: ''[[s:On the Use and Abuse of History for Life|On the Use and Abuse of History for Life]]'', first published 1874, translated 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporaries==
20th-century German historians promoting some aspects of historism are [[Ulrich Muhlack]], [[Thomas Nipperdey]] and [[J√∂rn R√ºsen]].

Also the Spanish philosopher [[Jos√© Ortega y Gasset]] was influenced by historism.

The origin of first humans to populate the southern continent remains a matter of conjecture and debate. Some anthropologist believe they could have arrived as a result of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|earliest human migrations out of Africa]]. Although they likely migrated to the territory, later named Australia, though [[Southeast Asia]] they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or [[Polynesia]]n population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the [[Austronesian people]]s of modern-day [[New Guinea]] and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]]. (1997). ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. Random House. London. pp 314‚Äì316&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of first European contact, it is generally estimated that between 315,000 to 750,000 people lived in Australia, in [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|diverse groups]], but upper estimates place the total population as high as 1.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Queensland |last= Evans |first= R. |year= 2007 |publisher= Cambridge U.

In the early [[History of Australia (1901‚Äì45)|1900s]] it was commonly believed that the Aboriginal population of Australia was leading toward [[extinct]]ion. The population shrank from those present when colonisation occurred in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930; this was primarily due to an outbreak of [[smallpox]] and to a lesser extent from other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hopkins, ''Princes and Peasants'', Chicago, 1983, p. 207; Judy Campbell, ''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780‚Äì1880'', Melbourne, 2002, pp. 10, 39‚Äì50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smallpox Through History"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Smallpox Through History |url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKpBPdn?url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-colonisation, the coastal Indigenous populations were soon absorbed, depleted or forced from their lands; the traditional aspects of Aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the [[Great Sandy Desert]] where European settlement has been sparse. The greatest [[population density]] was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the [[Murray River]] valley in particular. However, Aboriginal Australians maintained successful communities throughout Australia, from the cold and wet highlands of [[Tasmania]] to the more [[deserts of Australia|arid parts of the continental interior]]. Technologies, diets and hunting practices varied according to the local environment.

It is believed that the first [[early human migration]] to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the [[Sahul continent]], connected to the island of New Guinea via a [[land bridge]]. It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between [[Sulawesi]] and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via [[Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;Lourandos, H., ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The most generally accepted date for first arrival is between 40,000‚Äì80,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. Near [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in [[New South Wales]], since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools have been found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP.  When these results were new they were controversial, but more recent dating of the same strata in 1987 and 2003 has corroborated these dates.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | authorlink = Val Attenbrow| year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152‚Äì153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 Nov 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockton-Nanson-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Stockton | first1= Eugene D. | last2= Nanson | first2= Gerald C. |date=April 2004 | title= Cranebrook Terrace Revisited | journal= [[Archaeology in Oceania]] | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 59‚Äì60 | jstor=40387277  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 48,000 BCE date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using [[thermoluminescence]].

A large number of sites have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to around 38,000 BCE, leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique. Radiocarbon dating is limited to a maximum age of around 40,000 years. Some estimates have been given as widely as from 30,000 to 68,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6925/abs/nature01383.html Bowler, JM et al., (20 February 2003), "Letters: New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia", ''Nature'' 421, pp. 837‚Äì840]&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier dates are requiring new techniques such as [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) and [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS), and the evidence for an earlier date of arrival is growing.

[[Thermoluminescence dating]] of the Jinmium site in the [[Northern Territory]] suggested a date of 116,000 plus or minus 12,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Early human occupation of northern Australia: archaeology and thermoluminescence dating of Jinmium rock-shelter, Northern Territory by R.L.K. Fullagar, D.M. Price &amp; L.M. Head in Antiquity Vol 70 Number 270, December, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this result received wide press coverage, it is not accepted by most archaeologists. Only Africa has older physical evidence of habitation by [[modern human]]s. There is also evidence of a change in fire regimes in Australia, drawn from reef deposits in Queensland, between 70 and 100,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim "The Future Eaters"&lt;/ref&gt; and the integration of human genomic evidence from various parts of the world also supports a date of before 60,000 years for the arrival of Australian Aboriginal people in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen, (2004),"Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World"(Constable and Robinson; New Ed)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://[www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen "The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa"(Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers)({{ISBN|0-7867-1334-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans reached [[Tasmania]] approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the [[last glacial maximum]]. After the seas rose about 12,000 years ago and covered the land bridge, the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, J. and Kamminga, J., (1999), ''Prehistory of Australia''.

Short statured aboriginal tribes inhabited the [[rainforest]]s of North [[Queensland]], of which the best known group is probably the Tjapukai of the Cairns area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/orig/tindale/hdms/tindaletribes/tjapukai.htm Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes: Tjapukai (QLD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726175601/http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/orig/tindale/HDMS/tindaletribes/tjapukai.htm |date=26 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rainforest people, collectively referred to as Barrineans, were once considered to be a relic of an earlier wave of [[Negrito]] migration to the Australian continent,&lt;ref name="Australian pygmies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Pygmies%20Extinction.htm | title=The extinction of the Australian pygmies | work=[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]], Sydney Line | date=June 2002 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=[[Keith Windschuttle]] and Tim Gillin| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208091225/http://www.sydneyline.com/Pygmies%20Extinction.htm | archivedate= 8 December 2002 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this theory no longer finds much favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-June-2002/groves.html Colin Groves: 'Australia for the Australians']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mungo Man]], whose remains were discovered in 1974 near [[Lake Mungo]] in New South Wales, is the oldest human yet found in Australia. Although the exact age of Mungo Man is in [[Australian archaeology#Lake Mungo dating|dispute]], the best consensus is that he is at least 40,000 years old. Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated, based on [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic association]], to be about 50,000 years old. Since Lake Mungo is in south-eastern Australia, many [[archaeologist]]s have concluded that humans must have arrived in north-west Australia at least several thousand years earlier.

In 2012, the results of large-scale [[Human genome|genotyping]] has indicated that Aboriginal Australians, the [[Papuan people|indigenous peoples of New Guinea]] and the [[Lumad peoples#Mamanwa|Mamanwa]], an indigenous people of the southern [[Philippines]] are closely related, having diverged from a common origin approximately 36,000 years ago. The same studies show that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11% Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia, indicating a substantial gene flow between [[Indian people|Indian populations]] and Northern Australia occurred around 4,230 years ago. Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time, suggesting there may have been migration from [[India]].&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Irina Pugach |author2=Frederick Delfin |author3=Ellen Gunnarsd√≥ttir |author4=Manfred Kayser |author5=Mark Stoneking |title=Genome-wide data substantiate Holocene gene flow from India to Australia |date=14 January 2013 |journal=PNAS |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=1803‚Äì1808 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1211927110 |pmid=23319617 |pmc=3562786|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1803P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm Aboriginal genes suggest Indian migration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820123208/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm |date=20 August 2013 }} [[Australian Geographic]] 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago, as sea levels were rising, showing some of the human archaeological sites]]
When the north-west of Australia, which is closest to Asia, was first occupied, the region consisted of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|open tropical forests]] and [[woodland]]s. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, by which time the Aboriginal people had settled the entire continent, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice age. By the [[Last Glacial Maximum#Australasia|glacial maximum]], 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to around 140 metres below its present level. Australia was connected to New Guinea and the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]] was separated from [[Southeast Asia]] (''[[Wallacea]]'') by a [[strait]] only approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name="Coukell"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Coukell | first =  Allan | year =  May 2001 | title =  Could mysterious figures lurking in Australian rock art be the world's oldest shamans? |magazine=  [[New Scientist]] | volume =  | issue =  |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall was 40% to 50% lower than modern levels, depending on region, while the lower [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;J.G.

The Kimberley, including the adjacent exposed continental [[Sahul Shelf]], was covered by vast grasslands dominated by flowering plants of the family [[Poaceae]], with woodlands and semi-arid scrub covering the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia.&lt;ref name="ENSO"&gt;McGowan H, Marx S, Moss P, Hammond A. Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia. GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 39, L22702, 5 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2012GL053916 http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053916.shtml Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast of the Kimberley, from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to northern Tasmania the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered largely by extreme deserts and [[Dune|sand dunes]]. It is believed that during this period no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah, while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of Queensland.

Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time, and there would seem to have been scattered [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|"refugia"]] in which the modern vegetation types and Aboriginal populations were able to survive. Corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact, and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called "[[Songlines]]" today.&lt;ref name="dodson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dodson | first = J.R. | year = September 2001 | title = Holocene vegetation change in the mediterranean-type climate regions of Australia | journal = The Holocene | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 673‚Äì680 | doi=10.1191/09596830195690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Adams [http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html Australasia during The Last 150,000 Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226170218/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html |date=26 February 2013 }}  Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.H.Monroe  [http://austhrutime.com/glacial_maximum_australia.htm Last Glacial Maximum in Australia] Australia: The Land Where Time Began: A biography of the Australian continent&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the ice age, strong rains returned, until around 5,500 years ago, when the wet season cycle in the north ended, bringing with it a megadrought that lasted 1,500 years.

Following the Ice Age, Aboriginal people around the coast, from [[Arnhem Land]], the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] and the southwest of Western Australia, all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the Ice Age. It was this event that isolated the Tasmanian Aboriginal people on their island, and probably led to the extinction of Aboriginal cultures on the [[Bass Strait]] Islands and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.&lt;ref name="Flood, Josephine 1994"/&gt;  In the interior, the end of the Ice Age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semi-desert areas by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the [[Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages|Pama‚ÄìNyungan]] language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving [[circumcision]]. There has been a long history of contact between [[Papuans|Papuan]] peoples of the [[Papua New Guinea|Western Province]], [[Torres Strait Islanders]] and the Aboriginal people in [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Josephine 1994"&gt;Flood, Josephine (1994), "Archaeology of the Dreamtime" (Angus &amp; Robertson; 2Rev Ed)({{ISBN|0-207-18448-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal Australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment. There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment. One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the [[marsupial]] [[megafauna]] (also see [[Australian megafauna]]). Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna. Others claim that, because the megafauna were large and slow, they were easy prey for human hunters. A third possibility is that human modification of the environment, particularly through the use of fire, indirectly led to their extinction. Oral history demonstrates "the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians" for at least 10,000 years. This is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean [[shoreline]]s; oral records of megafauna; and comets.&lt;ref name=ABC201411&gt;{{cite web

The introduction of the dingo, possibly as early as 3500 BCE, showed that contact with South East Asian peoples continued, as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of Thailand.  This contact was not just one-way, as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates. Dingoes began and evolved in Asia. The earliest known dingo-like fossils are from Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand (dated at 5500 years BP) and from north Vietnam (5000 years BP). According to skull morphology, these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves (prime candidates were the pale footed (or Indian) wolf ''Canis lupus pallipes'' and the Arabian wolf ''Canis lupus arabs'') and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Laurie (1995), "The Dingo: in Australia and Asia"&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of [[fire-stick farming]] that was responsible for these extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim "The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People" (Grove Press)({{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for "at least 17,000 years". Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes: to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey; to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires; to make travel easier; to eliminate pests; for ceremonial purposes; for warfare and just to "clean up country." There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which this burning led to large-scale changes in vegetation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/aboriginal-australians-co-existed-with-the-megafauna-for-at-least-17-000-years-70589|last1=Westaway|first1=Michael|last2=Olley|first2=Jon|last3=Grun|first3=Rainer|title=Aboriginal Australians co-existed with the megafauna for at least 17,000 years|work=The Conversation|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
[[File:Aboriginal grinding stones.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Aboriginal grinding stones - a pestle and mortar - vital in making flours for [[bush bread]]. Aboriginal women were expert at making bread from a variety of seasonal grains and nuts.]]
Aboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, [[boomerang]], or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent [[Aboriginal tracker|trackers]] and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell.

Fish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. The mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region. While Torres Strait Island populations were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods, most Aboriginal Australians were [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights.

This woven basket style is from Northern Australia. Baskets were used for collecting fruits, corms, seeds and even water ‚Äì some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight.]]
In present-day [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]] in the territory of the [[Djab Wurrung]], which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see [[Gunditjmara]]). A primary tool used in hunting is the [[spear]], launched by a [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a [[Throwing Stick]]), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.

On mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo was [[domestication|domesticated]], however domestic pigs were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders. The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, [[kangaroo]], [[emu]], [[wombat]]s, [[goanna]], snakes, birds, many insects such as [[honeypot ant|honey ants]], [[Bogong moth]]s and [[witchetty grub]]s. Many varieties of plant foods such as [[taro]], [[coconut]]s, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.

===Culture===
[[File:Lomandra textiles.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Lomandra'', a plant used by Aboriginal Australians for weaving]]
Permanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were [[semi-nomadic]], moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following [[seasonal food]] sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of [[midden]]s, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. [[Rock painting]] at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent [[Sydney rock engravings|rock paintings found in the Sydney basin]] area which date to around 5,000 years.

[[Harry Lourandos]] has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in [[stone tool]] technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo.

Many Indigenous communities also have a very complex [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship]] structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]]. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as [[corroboree]]s) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented [[inbreeding]] in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups.

==Impact of British colonisation==
{{See also|European exploration of Australia|History of Australia (1788‚Äì1850)|Australian frontier wars}}

===1788‚Äì1900, European settlement===
[[File:Native Encampment by Skinner Prout, from Australia (1876, vol II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|right|A 19th-century engraving of an Aboriginal Australian encampment, showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of Australia at the time of European settlement.]]
In 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast of Australia in the name of the [[United Kingdom]] and named it New South Wales. Cook's declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the  inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788. The most immediate consequence of British settlement ‚Äì within weeks of the first colonists' arrival ‚Äì was a wave of European epidemic diseases such as [[chickenpox]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]] and [[measles]], which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline.

The second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought [[venereal disease]], to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and [[substance abuse]] has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since.  Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers arrived or recorded their existence.

====Diseases====
Deadly [[Infectious disease#Historic pandemics|infectious diseases]] like smallpox, influenza and [[tuberculosis]] were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html Invisible Invaders]&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population.&lt;ref name="Smallpox Through History"/&gt; In 1789, a disastrous smallpox epidemic broke out, killing up to 70% of the Indigenous people of the Sydney region. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the [[First Fleet]], it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive [[hunters and gatherers]] dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve.

Lieutenant [[William Bradley (New South Wales colonial politician)|William Bradley]] recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White who believed they were suffering from "slight inflammatory complaints".&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with Sixty-five Plates of Non Descript Animals, Birds, Lizards, Serpents, Curious Cones of Trees and Other Natural Productions'', London, 1795, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the smallpox epidemic is controversial, and it has been speculated that the surgeons on board the First Fleet brought vials of smallpox matter and either accidentally or intentionally released it as a "[[biological weapon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |title=The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789 |journal=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society |author=Mear, Craig |accessdate=11 May 2013|date=June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, writing in ''Journal of Australian Studies'', Christopher Warren concluded that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox, possibly without informing Governor Phillip but conceded in his conclusion that "today's evidence only provides for a balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Smallpox at Sydney Cover - who, when and why?|last=Warren|first=Christopher|url=https://capitalaintnatural.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/smallpox-sydney-cove.pdf|journal=Journal of Australian Studies |volume=38 |issue=1|date=March 2014|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79,68‚Äì86}}

====Conflicts====
On the mainland, [[Australian Frontier Wars|prolonged conflict]] followed the frontier of European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairnsmuseum.org.au/aboriginal.htm "The War for the land: A Short History of Aboriginal-European relations in Cairns."]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote: "There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 1834.

Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the [[Noongar]] of south-western Australia, led by [[Yagan]], who was killed in 1833. The [[Kalkadoon]] of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at [[Coniston, Northern Territory|Coniston]] in the Northern Territory in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000 - 20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]]. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Windshuttle, The Fabrication of the Aboriginal Death Toll', in Quadrant, November 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 [[white people]] were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html The Statistics of Frontier Conflict]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.

The [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Palawa]], or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a [[genocide|genocidal policy]], in the form of the "[[Black War]]". Other historians dispute this. [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: "Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, Geoffrey : A Land Half Won, Macmillan, South Melbourne, Vic., 1980, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephine Flood]] wrote: "The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones."&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1741148725}}, p89&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803‚Äì47, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, Keith (2002). The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847. Sydney: Macleay Press. {{ISBN|1-876492-05-8}}, pp351-397&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, H. A. Willis, has subsequently disputed Windschuttle's figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 1803‚Äì34 alone, with possibly another 145 killed during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC&amp;dq Josephine Flood, 2006, ''The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People''], Allen &amp; Unwin, ({{ISBN|1-74114-872-3}}) p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, ''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed, but untrue, that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was [[Truganini]], who died in 1876. This belief stems from a distinction between "full bloods" and "[[half-caste|half castes]]" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s set up on the islands of Bass Strait.
[[File:JM Crossland - Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer.jpg|thumb|right|This portrait of a young Indigenous boy was commissioned by a member of a Christian mission station to show the achievements of the mission at "civilising" the Indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=62236 |title=Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer |last=Radford |first=Ron |work=Collection highlights: National Gallery of Australia |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2010 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Nevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the [[Guugu Yimithirr people|Guugu Yimithirr]] people who met James Cook near [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] in 1770. [[Bennelong]] served as [[interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]] between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as [[John King (explorer)|John King]], who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]], an escaped convict, who was with the [[Wautharong]] people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian [[cricket]] team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players.

====Agriculture====
As the European [[transhumance|pastoral]] industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood.

In south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the [[Australian goldrushes]]. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, [[rabbits in Australia|rabbits]] and [[cattle]], all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably [[pearl]]ing, also employed Aboriginal workers.

In many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources.

===1900‚Äì1940s===
[[File:SLNSW 75764 Warriors in Ambush series 49 Aboriginal Mystic Bora Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Aboriginal Bora ceremony (early 20th century)]]
In spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century. In [[World War I|1914]] around 800 Aboriginal people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2008/04/24/aboriginal-anzacs/ |title=Aboriginal ANZACS |publisher=Australian War Memorial |first=Robyn |last=Van Dyk |date=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; answered the call to arms, despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military. As the war continued, these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed. Many enlisted by claiming they were [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] or [[Historical definitions of races in India|Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

By the 1920s, the Indigenous population had declined to between 50,000 and 90,000, and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held, even among Australians sympathetic to their situation. But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of [[penicillin]] to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline.

In the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the [[Caledon Bay crisis]], and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

In the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], the father of modern social anthropology, published his ''Social Organization of Australian Tribes'' in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Cowlishaw|chapter=Australian Aboriginal studies: The anthropologists' accounts|title=The Cultural Construction of Race|editor=M. de Lepervanche|editor2=G.

By the end of World War II, many Indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary. However, Aboriginal workers remained [[unfree labour]]ers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, [[Jack Patten]] led a strike at [[Cummeragunja Mission]] in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meager rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]], and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koorihistory.com/jack-patten/ Koori History: Remembering Jack Patten&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1946, Aboriginal station workers in the [[Pilbara]] region of Western Australia started the [[1946 Pilbara strike]] and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal [[Pastoral Industry Award]] of 1968, which required the payment of a [[minimum wage]] to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became [[refugees]] or [[fringe dwellers]], living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities.

In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections.

All Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] government in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm Australian Electoral Commission - Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians]&lt;/ref&gt; The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in [[Australian federal election, 1963|November 1963]]. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965.

The [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referendums.

In 1971, [[Yolngu]] people at [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] sought an injunction against [[Nabalco]] to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial [[Gove land rights case]], Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been [[terra nullius]] before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the [[Yolngu]] people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|Woodward Commission]], and then to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act]].

In 1972, the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was established on the steps of [[Politics of Australia|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were "strangers in their own country". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site.

In 1975, the [[Whitlam]] government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissal of the Whitlam government]] by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]) was introduced by the coalition government led by [[Malcolm Fraser]]. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant "inalienable" freehold title to some traditional lands.

In 1984, [[Pintupi Nine|a group of Pintupi]] people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the [[Gibson Desert]] in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_1_no_2/exhibition_reviews/colliding_worlds/ Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932‚Äì1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 federal government report described the history of the "Aboriginal Homelands Movement" or "Return to Country movement" as "a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, reserves, missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country."&lt;ref name=RepsCountry&gt;{{cite web|title=RETURN TO COUNTRY THE ABORIGINAL HOMELANDS MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/reports/1987/1987_PP125A.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], declaring the previous legal concept of ''[[terra nullius]]'' to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise [[Native Title]] claims over land in Australia.

In 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see [[Stolen generation]]) from their families, a [[National Sorry Day]] was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]].

In 1999 a [[Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)|referendum]] was held to change the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic.

In 2004, the Australian Government abolished The [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, [[Geoff Clark (politician)|Geoff Clark]], as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been [[mainstream]]ed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The [[Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination]] was established within the then [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs]], and now with the [[Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] to coordinate a "whole of government" effort.

In June 2005, [[Richard Frankland]], founder of the '[[Your Voice]]' political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth-century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians "be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the [[Australian War Memorial]]". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, [[The Age]], said that "Frankland has raised an important question," and asked whether moving "work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history."

In 2008, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] made a formal [[Stolen generations#Australian federal parliament apology|apology for the Stolen Generations]].

{{Humanism}}

'''Humanistic historiography''' is a method in [[historiography]]. This method is based on the principles of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanistic_historiography Articles for Humanistic historiography].&lt;/ref&gt; The new style of (humanistic) historiography was established by the Florentine History of Bruni (published from 1416 to 1449), and certain characteristics of the model still determined the treatment of political history in [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Florentine Histories|Istorie Firoentine]]'', as well as his delimitation of political subject matter at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritzwagner.com/ev/humanistic_historiography.html Humanistic Historiography as War and Personalities].&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us briefly enumerate these characteristics. The humanists used Livy as their model. This choice had certain consequences insofar as the treatment of history had to concentrate on such exciting events as wars and revolutions to the exclusion of the permanent factors and the long-range developments that determine the texture of history.

Moreover, in the interest of rhetorical and dramatic effectiveness, the individual had to become the center of action to such a degree that again the permanent determinants that in fact leave not so much room for heroic freedom were obscured.

The Roman model had, furthermore, the effect of a radical secularization of political problems. The humanistic concentration on the history of the republic in the Roman manner entailed the break with the Christian view of history. The rigidly closed stream of secular state history did not admit a divine Providence governing a universal history. Such problems as the translatio imperii and the speculation of the four world monarchies disappeared without a word of discussion.

In the eighteenth century, when [[Voltaire]] started his secularization of history, the polemic against the Christian position of Bossuet was of absorbing interest. The humanists of the fifteenth century ignored the Christian problem as if it did not exist.

==Organisation==
The 84 mile route was lit by 500 gas beacons, flares and torches at 250m intervals, with the assistance of more than 1000 volunteers. Approximately 120 landowners allowed access onto their lands for the event to take place.

The project was led by [[Hadrian‚Äôs Wall Heritage Ltd]] and supported by several other groups, which form part of North East England‚Äôs programme of festivals and events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.17532&lt;/ref&gt; The event marked the beginning of British Tourism week as supported by the Carlisle Tourism Partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8550000/8550446.stm | work=BBC News | title=Helping to light Hadrian's Wall | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;England's Roman Frontier, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; and the 500 points of light were filmed by a helicopter at dusk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">A '''knowledge society''' generates, shares and makes available to all members of the [[society]] knowledge that may be used to improve the [[human condition]]. A knowledge society differs from an [[information society]] in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action while the latter only creates and disseminates the [[raw data]].&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi"&gt;Castelfranchi, C. (2007).  [https://jcom.sissa.it/sites/default/files/documents/Jcom0604(2007)C03.pdf Six critical remarks on science and the construction of the knowledge society].  ''Journal of Science Communication, 6''(4), 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout [[History of the world|human history.]] However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and [[Science communication|information dissemination]] that results from the [[innovation]] of [[Information technology|information technologies]].&lt;ref name="Vallima"&gt;Vallima, J. &amp; Hoffman, D. (2008).  Knowledge society discourse and higher education.  ''Higher Education, 56''(3), 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2005).  Toward knowledge societies.  ''UNESCO World Report''.  Conde-sur-Noireau, France:  Imprimerie Corlet.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information and communication technology ==

The growth of [[Information and communication technology]] (ICT) has significantly increased the world‚Äôs capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the [[Internet]] delivered unheard-of quantities of [[information]] to people. The [[evolution]] of the internet from [[Web 1.0]] to [[Web 2.0]] offered individuals tools to connect with each other [[World Wide Web|worldwide]] as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and [[mobile device]]s offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform [[education]], [[training]], [[employment]] and access to life-sustaining resources for all members of society.&lt;ref name="VanWeert"&gt;van Weert, T. J. (2006).  Education of the twenty-first century:  New professionalism in lifelong learning, knowledge development and knowledge sharing.  ''Education and Information Technologies, 11''(3), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
However, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in [[knowledge]] creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create [[awareness]], meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind.&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi" /&gt; Absent reflection and [[critical thinking]], information can actually become "non-knowledge", that which is false or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Innerarity"&gt;Innerarity, D. (2012).  Power and knowledge:  The politics of the knowledge society, ''European Journal of Social Theory, 16''(1), 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P.L. (2010).  Applying social systems thinking and community informatics thinking in education.  In Rudestam, K.E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (Eds.), 91-128.  ''Handbook of online learning''.  Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T. (2009, Mar 13).  Tim Berners-Lee:  The next web of open, linked data [Video].  Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social theory ==

The [[social theory]] of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the [[politics]], [[economics]], and culture of [[Modernity|modern society.]] Associated ideas include the [[knowledge economy]] created by economists and the [[learning society]] created by educators.&lt;ref name="Vallima" /&gt; Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, [[individual]]s, [[Community|communities]], and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. [[Peter Drucker]] viewed knowledge as a key [[Economic resources|economic resource]] and coined the term [[knowledge worker]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P.F. (1969).  ''The age of discontinuity:  Guidelines to our changing society''.  New York, NY:  Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; Fast forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Paavola, S. &amp; Hakkarainen, K. (2005).  The knowledge creation metaphor:  An emergent epistemological approach to learning.  Science &amp; Education, 14, 535-557.&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
A knowledge society promotes [[human rights]] and offers equal, inclusive, and [[universal access to all knowledge]] creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society:&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;
*[[Cultural diversity]]	
*Equal access to [[education]]
*[[Universal Access|Universal access]] to information (in the [[public domain]])
*[[Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression]]

However, they acknowledge that the [[digital divide]] is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world‚Äôs population.&lt;ref&gt;Sanou, B. (2013).  The world in 2013:  ICT fact and figures.  Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, [[geography]], age, [[gender]], [[language]], [[education]], social and cultural background, [[employment]] and [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

== Politics ==

To reduce the span of the digital divide, [[Leadership|leaders]] and [[Politician|policymakers]] worldwide must first develop and understanding of knowledge societies and second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for [[decision-making]].  Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact [[human]]kind. [[Science]] is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased [[ignorance]] or non-knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, M. (2010). ''Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, [[probability]], [[risk]] and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt;

To confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and [[observation]] of consequences.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt; Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome versus find the perfect solution.  [[Democratization]] of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.

== Education ==

As technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; For a society where [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[counting]] are a requisite for [[Activities of daily living|daily living]], skills in reading, [[writing]], and [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic]] are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

One marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands [[lifelong learning]], knowledge development, and [[knowledge sharing]]. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education [[professional]]s will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between [[technology]] and [[Education|teaching]].&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the [[W. Edwards Deming]] [[PDCA|Plan-do-check-act cycle]]&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; that promotes [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]]. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.

The '''law of social cycle''' is a [[social cycle theory]] developed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]. It is based on the theory of human historical motivity based on "the ancient spiritual ideas of the [[Vedas]]". The theory was developed in the 1950s and expanded by [[Ravi Batra]] since the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarkar Theory of Social Cycles and Class Hierarchy|url=http://kenketchum.tripod.com/newyorkchristianlawlibrary/id4.html|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]] since the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sarkar's theory of social change | url=http://www.metafuture.org/Articles/IntroductoryChapterfromthebookSituatingSarkar.htm | accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating the experience of social change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-4HTCW30-5&amp;_user=713789&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000039858&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=713789&amp;md5=b6a0cb62db026240a72731b35556b7b0|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visions for Global Justice through the Lens of Sarkar's Social Cycle|url=http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/9-3/A04.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing the neo-humanist game|url=http://www.pspl.com.au/Ideas%20written%20down_files/playing%20the%20neohumanist%20game-1.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human society==
The theory first appeared in [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar|Sarkar's]] book ''Human Society'', Vol. 2 in the late 1950s and has since been reproduced and expanded on in many books. The theory has probably received the widest publication in the West in the many books of Ravi Batra, a disciple of Sarkar, notably ''[[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, a New Study of History]]'', ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]'' and ''[[The New Golden Age|The New Golden Age: The Coming Revolution against Political Corruption and Economic Chaos]]''. Johan Galtung and Sohail Inayatullah have also written about Sarkars' social cycle theory in the book ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians''. The theory owes to the work of [[Sri Aurobindo]], ''[[The Human Cycle]]'', which was published in 1949 but originally written in 1916‚Äì1918 under the title ''The Psychology of Social Development''.

==Four types of people==
The law of social cycle is a theory of [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]], arising out of the Indian [[episteme]] (Inayatullah, 2002). This law states that while people in any society are all relatively similar, they have generally the same goals, desires and ambitions but differ in the way they go about achieving their goals. An individual's specific methods for achieving success depend on his physical and psychological makeup. Essentially, there are four different psychological types of people, warriors, intellectuals, acquisitors and labourers, who find basic fulfillment in four different kinds of ways.

===Warriors===
Warriors, or  ''Kshatriya'' in [[Sanskrit]], have strong bodies, vigorous physical energy and a sharp intellect. Warriors tend to develop the skills that take advantage of their inherent gifts of stamina, courage and vigor. Their mentality is one that is not averse to taking physical risks. Examples of people in our society with the warrior mentality include policemen, firemen, soldiers, professional athletes, skilled carpenters, and tradesmen. They all achieve success through their physical skills and a deep understanding of their profession.

===Intellectuals===
Intellectuals, or ''Vipra'', have a more developed intellect than the warriors, but generally lack the physical strength and vigor. Intellectuals are happiest when they try to achieve success by developing and expressing their intellectual skills and talents. Teachers, writers, professors, scientists, artists, musicians, philosophers, doctors and lawyers, and above all, priests, are professions intellectuals tend to pursue.

===Acquisitors===
Acquisitors, or ''Vaishya'', have a penchant for acquiring money. If money can be made the acquisitors will find a way to make it. They are not considered as bright as the intellectuals, nor as strong as the warriors, but they are keen when it comes to making and accumulating money and material possessions. Such people are the traders, businessmen, managers, entrepreneurs, bankers, brokers, and landlords in our society.

===Laborers===
Laborers, or ''Shudra'', are altogether different from the first three groups. Laborers lack the energy and vigor of the warriors, the keen intellect of the intellectuals, or the ambition and drive of the accumulators. In spite of the fact that their contribution to society is profound ‚Äì in fact, society could not function without them ‚Äì the other groups generally look down upon and tend to exploit them. The laborers are the peasants, serfs, clerks, short order cooks, waiters, janitors, doormen, cabdrivers, garbage collectors, truck drivers, night watchmen and factory workers who keep society running smoothly by working diligently and without complaint.

==Epochs of social classes==
[[File:Law of Social Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of P.R. Sarkar's Law of Social Cycle]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Groups of each type of people make up the social classes in society. Sarkar simplifies society into four classes, divided by inherent traits:
*Warriors defend the nation and keep the peace;
*Intellectuals develop our ideas about the world, in the form of religion, art, law and new inventions;
*Acquisitors manage the practical aspects of life, including farms, factories, financial institutions and stores;
*Laborers do the routine work, waiting tables, collecting trash, and other low-tech, low skill jobs.

==Modern social development==
According to Batra (1978), the West is currently in the age of acquisitors, also known as Capitalism. This age succeeded the 'age of intellectuals', which gave birth to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[British parliamentary system]]. Before that the West went through the 'age of warriors' and the [[age of discovery]]. [[Feudalism]], an earlier 'age of acquisitors', reigned before that. It had replaced the 'age of intellectuals', with restrictions on religious thought and also gave birth to the [[Renaissance|Renaissance period]]. Before that, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] ruled the West under the aegis of warriors.

==Exploitation and breakdown==
To Sarkar, each age would run its course, with the social motivity going too far, causing much grief to the majority of people (Sarkar, 1967). The situation could go on unchecked for a long time, before things got so bad that a spontaneous revolution and overthrow of the system took place. In fact, as this was the reason for social change, it was clear that no single class of people could remain dominant indefinitely. Social power was destined to pass from one class to next in the prescribed order, or cycle. The 'age of warriors', which brings strict order to society and a return to fundamental values, essentially leads to excessive focus on strong man rule and warfare. It is followed by an 'age of intellectuals', which bring a sense of liberation in the mental sphere but soon replace that freedom with the yoke of newer ideas. Over time this age merges into an 'age of acquisitors', which brings progress in the material sphere, but this is soon replaced by increased physical and mental exploitation. The [[Servile Wars]] spelled the doom of the [[Roman Republic]]. Labour conflict could be the undoing of Capitalism, according to this theory. And so the cycle moves on its endless round, until the civilisation ceases to exist or is taken over by a superior or more powerful civilisation.

==Preventing the misery of exploitation==
Sarkar's essential view on the implications of each age was to develop a way to avoid the dynamic of exploitation, when the social motivity of one class goes unchecked and too far (Sarkar, 1967). In such cases, it falls on moralists to accelerate the movement to the next age to shorten the exploitative phase of each age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prout's Theory of Revolution|url=http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/04/prouts_theory_o.html|accessdate=2009-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060117171449/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/04/prouts_theory_o.html|archivedate=17 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
In Sarkar's vision social progress is seen to be established on the basis of a new vision of [[Progressive utilization theory|human progress]]. Sarkar's theory focuses on four basic ages of warriors, intellectuals and acquisitors, as well as a brief age of labourers. During such ages humanity has faced an eternal struggle with each [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] deteriorating into a harmful [[wikt:exploit#Verb|exploitative]] phase. Sarkar devises an [[exit strategy]] from such a development, based on the role of enlightened moralists, the [[Sadvipras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/03/sadvipras.html|title=The Place of Sadvipras in the Social Cycle|accessdate=2009-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707004018/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/03/sadvipras.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is their role, based on their self-less virtues and ideation on the [[Divinity|divine]], to apply energy and accelerate social progress when the evolutionary process is caught up in a [[Stasis (political history)|stasis]] whereby the ruling class has abandoned its original [[virtue]]s and through an intense focus on their [[motivity|social agenda]] inflict [[wiktionary:misery|misery]] on the other sections of society.

==Harmony and cooperation==
For this, Sarkar trained nuns and monks of his ''socio-spiritual movement'' [[Ananda Marga]] and developed the socio-economic [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] (PROUT).

{{Indo-Greek articles}}
The '''legacy of the Indo-Greeks''' starts with the formal end of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] from the 1st century CE, as the Greek communities of central Asia and northwestern India lived under the control of the [[Kushan]] branch of the Yuezhi, apart from a short-lived invasion of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Though the Indo-Greek monarchies seem to have ended in the first century BC, the Greek presence in India and Bactria remained strong", McEvilley, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kushans founded the [[Kushan Empire]], which was to prosper for several centuries. In the south, the Greeks were under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapas]].

It is unclear how much longer the Greeks managed to maintain a distinct presence in the Indian sub-continent.

==Political legacy==

[[File:Couple from Taxila IV.jpg|thumb|Hellenistic couple from [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] (IV).]]
The 36 Indo-Greek kings known through epigraphy or through their coins belong to the period between 180&amp;nbsp;BCE to 10‚Äì20 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Boppearachchi, "Monnaies Indo-Grecques".&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few hints of a later Indo-Greek political presence in the Indian subcontinent.

[[Theodamas]], known from an inscription on a signet, may have been an Indo-Greek ruler in the [[Bajaur]] area in the 1st century CE.

In the 3rd century, the Scythian [[Western Satraps]] seem to have relied on Greeks, such as [[Yavanesvara]] ("Lord of the Greeks"), who may have been organized in more or less independent ''[[poleis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sort of Greek political organization is thought to have existed in the first half of the 4th century after the rule of the [[Satavahanas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pingree]], "The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja", p4. Quotes in McEvilley, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also suggested by the [[Puranas]] (the [[Matsya Purana]], the [[Vayu Purana]], the [[Brahmanda Purana]], the [[Vishnu Purana]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]]) which give a list of the dynasties who ruled following the decline of the [[Satavahanas]]: this list includes 8 [[Yavana]] kings, thought to be some dynasty of Greek descent, although they are not otherwise known.&lt;ref&gt;Comments given in Rapson "Catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc...", Rapson, p LXVIII:&lt;br /&gt;
"These must, no doubt, belong to some dynasty of Greek descent, but it is impossible to determine which dynasty this could have been"&lt;br /&gt;The full list, with comments, is given in Rapson "Catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc...", Rapson, p LXVIII:
:* 7 other Andhras kings (called "Andhrabhrytias", or "Servant of the Andhras", probably the [[Chutus]] in the Western and Southern districts.
:* 10 [[Abhiras|Abhira]] kings, who ruled in the area of [[Nasik]].
:* 7 [[Gardabhilas|Gardabhila]] kings, who ruled in the area of [[Ujjain]]
:* 18 [[Saka]] kings, probably the [[Western Satraps]].
:* 8 [[Yavana]] kings, thought to be some dynasty of Greek descent.
:* 14 [[Tusaras|Tusara]] kings (also called Tuhkara, Tuskara), thought to be the [[Kushans]] (who are called "Turuska" in the Rajatarangini).
:* 13 [[Murundas|Murunda]] or Gurunda kings.
:* 21 [[Hunas|Huna]] kings (also called Maunas), probably the [[Indo-Hephthalites]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to one theory however, the Southern Indian dynasty of the [[Chalukyas]] was named after "[[Seleucia|Seleukia]]" (the [[Seleucids]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lewis Rice, S. R. Sharma and M. V. Krishna Rao {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Gangas of Talkad|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka14.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka. Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; their conflict with the [[Pallava]] of Kanchi being but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and "[[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]", the proposed ancestors of [[Pallavas]]. Dr. Lewis's theory, based on the mere similarity of names, has not found acceptance at all because the Pallavas were in constant conflict with the [[Kadambas]], prior to the rise of Chalukyas.&lt;ref&gt;(2001), "A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present", Jupiter books, MCC (Reprinted 2002), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek cities==

Some Greek cities seem to have remained intact under Parthian rule: [[Isidorus of Charax]] in his 1st century CE "Parthian stations" itinerary described "[[Alexandria of the Arachosians|Alexandropolis]], the metropolis of [[Arachosia]]" as being Greek:
{{quote|"Beyond is Arachosia (Old Persian Hara[h]uvati, Avestan Haraxvaiti)). And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad (Haraxvat) and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus (Harahvati). As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians."|"Parthians stations", 1st century CE. Original text in paragraph 19 of [http://www.parthia.com/doc/parthian_stations.htm#PARTHIAN_STATIONS Parthian stations]}}
Also, the city of [[Alexandria Bucephalus]] on the [[Jhelum River]] is still mentioned in the 1st century [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], as well as in the Roman [[Peutinger Table]].

==Military role==

Greek mercenary soldiers from northwestern India are mentioned in the accounts of the [[Pandyan Kingdom]] in [[Madurai]], and described in admiring terms: "The valiant-eyed Yavanas, whose bodies were strong and of terrible aspect".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Theatre|author1=Pande, L.V.|author2=Varadpande, M.L.|date=1987|volume=1|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170172215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyxOHOCVcVkC|page=235|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 2nd century CE, the Central India [[Satavahana]] king [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] (r. 106‚Äì130 CE) was described as the "Destroyer of [[Saka]]s (''[[Western Kshatrapas]]''), [[Yavana]]s (''[[Indo-Greek]]s'') and [[Pahlava]]s (''[[Indo-Parthians]]'')" in his inscriptions, suggesting a continued presence of the Indo-Greeks until that time.&lt;ref&gt;From Rapson, "Indian coins in the British Museum". Following the above quote, Rapson writes: "The Kashtriyas are the native Indian princes, the Rajputs of Rajputana, Gujarat and Central India; and the Sakas, Yavanas, and Pahavas are respectively Scythian, Greeks and Persian invaders from the north, who established kingdoms in various districts of Northern and Western India", p. xxxvii, Rapson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenInArm4.JPG|thumb|250px|Men in Greek uniform, [[Tillia Tepe]], 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Afghanistan, les tr√©sors retrouv√©s", [[Guimet Museum]], item 79.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Around 200 CE, the [[Manu Smriti]] describes the downfall of the Yavanas, as well as many others:

''"43. But in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites, and of their not consulting [[Brahmana]]s, the following tribes of [[Kshatriya]]s have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of [[Shudra]]s;''&lt;br /&gt;
''44. (Viz.) the [[Paundrakas]], the [[Chodas]], the [[Dravidas]], the [[Kambojas]], the [[Yavanas]], the [[Shakas]], the [[Paradas]], the [[Pahlavas]], the [[Chinas]], the [[Kiratas]], the [[Daradas]] and the [[Khashas]]."'' (Manusmritti, X.43‚Äì44)

There are important references to the warring Mleccha hordes of the Yavanas, Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas, etc. in the Bala Kanda of the [[Valmiki]] [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;(1.54.21-23; 1.55.2-3).

:taih asit samvrita bhuumih Shakaih-Yavana mishritaih || 1.54-21 ||
:taih taih Yavana-Kamboja barbarah ca akulii kritaah || 1-54-23 ||

:yoni deshaat ca Yavanah Shakri deshat Shakah tathaa |
:roma kupesu Mlecchah ca Haritah sa Kiratakah || 1-55-3 ||
:: (Ramayana 1.54.21-23; 1.55.2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Indologists like Dr H. C. Raychadhury, Dr B. C. Law, Satya Shrava and others see, in these verses, the clear glimpses of the struggles of the Hindus with the mixed invading hordes of the barbaric Sakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas, Kambojas, etc. from north-west.&lt;ref&gt;The ≈öakas in India, 1981, p. 12, Satya Shrava; Journal, 1920, p. 175, University of Calcutta. Department of Letters; Political History of India from the Accession of Parikshit to the Coronation of Bimbisara, 1923, Page iii, Hemchandra Raychaudhuri;  Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 4, Raychaudhury;  Indological Studies, 1950, p. 4, Dr B. C. Law.&lt;/ref&gt; The time frame for these struggles is the 2nd century BCE downwards. Dr Raychadhury fixes the date of the present version of the Valmiki Ramayana around/after the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Political History of Ancient India, 1996, pp. 3‚Äì4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invading [[Orda (organization)|horde]]s of the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yavana]]s, [[Pahlava]]s, [[Abhira]]s, etc. from the north-west had entered Punjab, ''United Province'', [[Sindhu]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]] in large numbers, wrested political control of northern India from the [[Indo-Aryans]] and had established their respective kingdoms and principalities in the land of the Indo-Aryans.&lt;ref&gt;Cf also: 'Numerous Hindu references show, that there was a great inflow of foreign nations into India in the centuries before and after the Christian. The incorporation of foreign nations -- the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pahlavas &amp; the Paradas is mentioned in the [[Vishnu Purana]] (Indian Antiquary, IV, 166; Bombay Gazetteer, 1882, p 413, Bombay (India : State), Bombay  (Presidency),  [[Harivamsa]], [[Vayu Purana]]  and numerous other Puranic texts. The invading hordes referenced in the Gazetteer are the Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas, etc. (See: Bombay Gazett. Presidency, 1901, p 448). Mahabharata mentions the great hordes of the Sakas and Yavanas helping the Kambojas (See: Bombay Gazett. Presidency, 1901, p 461, fn 2). In the Army of Nahapana (130 CE), the great Pahlava conqueror of Malwa and north Daccan, the supporting military hordes were the Kshaharatas (i.e. the Kambojas per Dr T. L. Shah), Pahlavas, Sakas and Yavanas' (Cf: Bombay Gazett, 1901, p 461, fn 2; Journal B.B. R.A., Soc., VIII, p 236).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a distinct [[prophecy|prophetic]] statement in the [[Mahabharata]] which says that the Mlechha (Barbaric) kings of the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Abhiras, etc. will rule unrighteously in [[Kaliyuga]].&lt;ref&gt;

:viparite tada loke purvarupa.n kshayasya tat. 28.
:bahavo mechchha rajanah prithivyam manujadhipa.
:mithyanushasinah papa mrishavadaparayanah. 29.
:Andhrah ShakAh Pulindashcha Yavanashcha naradhipah.
:Kamboja Aurnikah Shudrastathabhira narottama. 30.
:: (MBH 23/187/28-30)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr H. C. Ray Chaudhury, ''this is too clear a statement to be ignored'' or explained away.

This statement, couched in the form of [[prophecy]] in true [[puranic]] style, alludes to a historical situation (2nd and 1st century BC downwards) which followed the collapse of [[Maurya]] and [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] dynasties in North India.&lt;ref&gt;''"After the disintegration of Mauryan empire, the insecured frontier region of north-western part of India invited several foreign invaders i.e. Yavasnas, Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas from western and Central Asia who came in India through migrations and invasions. ...The moral and social degradation in the Indian society is indicated due to foreign invasions. Mahabharata states that Andhara, Sakas, Kambojas, Pulinda, Yavans, Vahlikas, Sudras, Abhiras, Mlechchas, will rule over the land and also will be addicted to falsehood"'' (Ref: Social Justice: Problems &amp; Perspectives {Seminar Proceedings of March 5‚Äì7, 1995}, 1996, p. 173, Jhinkoo Yadav, Dr Suman Gupta, Chandrajeet Yadav); See also: ''Ancient Kamboja People and the Country'', 1981, Dr J. L. Kamboj.&lt;/ref&gt;
'
This chaotic situation of [[Aryan]] India is said to have ended with the destruction of these Mlechcha [[Saka]], [[Kambojas|Kamboja]], [[Yavana]] and [[Pahlava|Parsika]] hordes by king [[Vikramaditya]] of [[Ujjain]]i (c. 60&amp;nbsp;BC) as is related by Brihat-Katha-Manjari of the [[Kashmir]]i Pandit [[Kshemendra]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]] of Somadeva, and the establishment of the ''Vikrama era''.&lt;ref&gt;

The "Avaca" Kharosthi inscription, found on a Buddhist relic casket, indicates that the old Greek military title of ''[[strategos]]'' ("commander") had apparently endured the Indo-Scythian invasion and was being used by the Apracarajas of [[Bajaur]] during the 1st century CE (the inscription mentions the dedication date of the casket as "the year 63 of the late Maharaja Aya", Aya being the Indo-Scythian ruler [[Azes I]], who started the [[Samvat (calendar eras)|Vikrama era]] in 58&amp;nbsp;BCE, therefore suggesting a date around 5 CE). The dedication mentions "vaga stratego puyaite viyayamitro ya" i.e. "The Lord Commander (Stratego) Viyayamitra is honored too".&lt;ref&gt;Avaca inscription: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/601111 Journal of the American Oriental Society], Vol. 102, No. 1 (January‚ÄìMarch, 1982), pp. 59‚Äì68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] is related by [[Philostratus]] in ''[[Life of Apollonius Tyana]]'' to have visited India, and specifically the city of [[Taxila]] around 46 CE. He describes constructions of the Greek type,&lt;ref&gt;Description of the Hellenistic urbanism of Taxila:&lt;br /&gt;
* "Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities" [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#¬ß20 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20)]
*"I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above." [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_21.html#¬ß23 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23)]&lt;/ref&gt;
probably referring to [[Sirkap]], and explains that the [[Indo-Parthian]] king of Taxila, named [[Phraotes]], received a Greek education at the court of his father and spoke Greek fluently:

[[File:AGAIGT.jpg|thumb|130px|"Ancient Indian and Indo-Greek theater" by M.L. Varadpande explores the Indo-Greek interaction in the theatrical arts.]]

:"Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place?"&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_26.html#¬ß29 |title=Flavius Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, II 29|author=Jona Lendering|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[...]-"My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves."&lt;ref name="livius2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_31.html#¬ß31 |title=Flavius Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, II 31 |author=Jona Lendering|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, from the [[Rabatak inscription]] we have the following information, tending to indicate that Greek was still in official use until the time of [[Kanishka]] (c. 120 CE):

:"He (Kanishka) issued(?) an edict(?) in Greek and then he put it into the Aryan language". ...but when Kanishka refers to "the Aryan language" he surely means Bactrian, ..."By the grace of Auramazda, I made another text in Aryan, which previously did not exist". It is difficult not to associate Kanishka's emphasis here on the use of the "Aryan language" with the replacement of Greek by Bactrian on his coinage. The numismatic evidence shows that this must have taken place very early in Kanishka's reign, ..." ‚Äî Prof. Nicholas Sims-Williams (University of London).

==Greek era==

A Greek "Yona" calendar era seems to have been in use in Northwestern Indian for several centuries following the foundation of the Indo-Greek kingdom. A recently discovered inscription in Kharoshthi on a Buddhist reliquary gives a relationship between several eras of the period:
:"In the twenty-seventh - 27 - year in the reign of Lord Vijayamitra, the King of the [[Apraca]]; in the seventy-third - 73 - year which is called "of Azes", in the two hundred and first - 201 - year of the Yonas (Greeks), on the eighth day of the month of Sravana; on this day was established [this] stupa by Rukhana, the wife of the King of Apraca, [and] by Vijayamitra, the king of Apraca, [and] by Indravarma (Indravasu?), the commander (stratega), [together] with their wives and sons."&lt;ref&gt;"Afghanistan, carrefour en l'Est et l'Ouest", p. 373. Also Senior, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Azes I|Azes]] era is usually considered identical to the [[Vikrama era]] starting in 58&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Yona era would correspond to 186&amp;nbsp;BCE, which falls in the reign of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]], although dates ranging from 186 to 150&amp;nbsp;BCE are still debated.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.kushan.org/essays/chronology/azesvikrama.htm Chronology of Indian eras]&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription would date to c. 15 CE.

A second inscription, called the Maghera inscription, found in the [[Mathura district]], is dated to the year 116 of the "Era of the Greeks" ("Yavanarajyasya sodasuttare varsasate 100 10 6), which would correspond to 70&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Afghanistan, carrefour en l'Est et l'Ouest", p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macedonian calendar==

[[File:TaxilaCopperPlate.JPG|thumb|The Indo-Scythian [[Taxila copper plate]] uses the Macedonian month of "[[Panemos]]" for calendrical purposes ([[British Museum]]).]]
The names of the months belonging to the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar]] remained in use under the [[Indo-Scythian]]s and the [[Kushan]]s until around the 2nd century CE. For example the Indo-Scythian [[Taxila copper plate]] inscription uses the Macedonian month of "[[Panemos]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Dast-i Nawur inscription mentioning the Kushan king [[Vima Kadphises]] (reigned circa 90‚Äì100 CE) is dated to the 279th year (possibly in the Yona era, which would make it 93 CE, but alternatively in "the Great Arya era" mentioned by [[Kanishka]] in the [[Rabatak inscription]], possibly an era started by [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] which would give 108 CE), and the 15th day of the month of "[[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Gorpaios]]" (ŒìŒøœÅœÄŒπŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ), which is the 11th month of the Macedonian calendar, corresponding to the moon of August.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Bussagli, "L'art du Gandhara", p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy and astrology==

One of the earliest Indian writings on astronomy and astrology (although not the earliest, as the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]'' is dated to around 135&amp;nbsp;BCE{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}), titled the ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' or ''"The Saying of the Greeks"'', is a translation from Greek to Sanskrit made by "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") in 149‚Äì150 CE under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] king [[Rudrakarman I]]. The Yavanajataka contains instructions on calculating astrological charts (horoscopes) from the time and place of one's birth. Astrology flourished in the Hellenistic world (particularly Alexandria) and the Yavanajataka reflects astrological techniques developed in the Greek-speaking world. Various astronomical and mathematical methods, such as the calculation of the 'horoskopos' (the zodiac sign on the eastern horizon), were used in the service of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, pp. 384‚Äì386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of treatises, the [[Paulisa Siddhanta]] and the [[Romaka Siddhantas]], are attributed to later Greco-Roman influence in India. The Paulisa Siddhanta has been tentatively identified with the works of [[Paulus Alexandrinus]], who wrote a well-known astrological hand-book.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Indian astronomy is widely acknowledged to be influenced by the Alexandrian school, and its technical nomenclature is essentially Greek.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Several other Indian texts show appreciation for the scientific knowledge of the "Yavana" Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Indian sources on Yavana learning:&lt;br&gt;
*A comment in "[[Brihat-Samhita]]" by the mathematician [[Varahamihira]] says:&lt;br&gt;"The Greeks, though impure, must be honored since they were trained in sciences and therein, excelled others....." ("mleccha hi yavanah tesu samyak shastram kdamsthitam/ rsivat te 'p i pujyante kim punar daivavid dvijah" (Brihat-Samhita 2.15)).
*Also the [[Mahabharata]] compliments the Greeks as "the all-knowing Yavanas" (sarvajnaa yavanaa):&lt;br&gt;"The Yavanas, O king, are omniscient; the Suras are particularly so. The [[mleccha]]s are wedded to the creations of their own fancy." ("sarvajnaa yavanaa rajan shuraaz caiva vishesatah/ mlecchah svasamjnaa niyataanaanukta itaro janah (Mahabharata VIII ([[Karna Parva]]).[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08045.htm 45.35]))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Indo-Greek coinage==
{{Further|Post-Mauryan coinage|Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara}}

[[File:Western Satrap Coin of Rudrasimha I .jpg|thumb|Coin of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] ruler [[Bhratadarman]] (278‚Äì295), with corrupted Greek legend on the obverse and [[BrƒÅhmƒ´ script|Brahmi]] legend on the reverse.]]

Overall, the coinage of the Indo-Greeks remained extremely influential for several centuries throughout the Indian subcontinent:

*The Indo-Greek weight and size standard for silver [[drachm]]s was adopted by the contemporary Buddhist kingdom of the [[Kuninda]]s in [[Punjab region|Punjab]],{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}&lt;!-- not in given ref this first part --&gt; the first attempt by an Indian kingdom to produce coins that could compare with those of the Indo-Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, pp. 324‚Äì325.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In central India, the [[Satavahana]]s (2nd century BCE- 2nd century CE) adopted the practice of representing their kings in profile, within circular legends.&lt;ref&gt;Rapson, clxxxviFF.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The direct successors of the Indo-Greeks in the northwest, the [[Indo-Scythians]] and [[Indo-Parthians]] continued displaying their kings within a legend in Greek, and on the obverse Greek deities.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Whitehead, ''Indo-Greek Coins'', 1914, pp. 91‚Äì97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*To the south, the [[Western Kshatrapas]] (1st-4th century) represented their kings in profile with circular legends in corrupted Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rapson "A catalogue of Indian coins in the British Museum. p.cix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was their (the Indo-Greek's) commercial success that led the western Satraps to imitate them." Narain, ''The Indo-Greeks'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Kushans]] (1st-4th century) used the Greek language on their coinage until the first few years of the reign of [[Kanishka]], whence they adopted the [[Bactrian language]], written with the Greek script.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, pp. 171‚Äì177.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] (4th-6th century), in turn imitating the [[Western Kshatrapas]], also showed their rulers in profile, within a legend in corrupted Greek, in the coinage of their western territories.&lt;ref&gt;"Evidence of the conquest of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurastra]] during the reign of [[Chandragupta II]] is to be seen in his rare silver coins which are more directly imitated from those of the [[Western Satraps]]... they retain some traces of the old inscriptions in Greek characters, while on the reverse, they substitute the Gupta type (a peacock) for the [[chaitya]] with crescent and star." in Rapson "A catalogue of Indian coins in the British Museum. The Andhras etc...", p. cli.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest use of the Greek script on coins corresponds to the rule of the Turkish [[Shahi]] of [[Kabul]], around 850.

==Genetic contribution==

[[File:HaddaTypes.JPG|thumb|200px|Portraits from the site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 3rd century CE.]]
Limited [[population genetics]] studies have been made on genetic markers such as [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] in the populations of the Indian subcontinent, to estimate the contribution of the Greeks to the genetic pool. Although some of the markers which are present in a large proportion of Greeks today have not been found, the Greek genetic contribution to the [[Punjab region]] has been estimated to be up to 15%:

{{quote|"The political influence of [[Seleucid]] and [[Greco-Bactrian|Bactrian dynastic Greeks]] over northwest India, for example, persisted for several centuries after the invasion of the army of [[Alexander the Great]] (Tarn 1951). However, we have not found, in Punjab or anywhere else in India, Y chromosomes with the M170 or M35 mutations that together account for 30% in [[Greeks]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonians]] today (Semino et al. 2000). Given the sample size of 325 Indian Y chromosomes examined, however, it can be said that the Greek homeland (or European, more generally, where these markers are spread) contribution has been 0%‚Äì3% for the total population or 0%‚Äì15% for Punjab in particular. Such broad estimates are preliminary, at best. It will take larger sample sizes, more populations, and increased molecular resolution to determine the likely modest impact of historic gene flows to India on its pre-existing large populations."|Kivisild et al. "Origins of Indian Casts and Tribes".&lt;ref&gt;Greek impact on the genetics of India (last paragraph):[http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Kivisild2003b.pdf Text]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some pockets of Greek populations probably remained for some time, and to this day, some communities in the [[Hindu Kush]] claim to be descendants of the Greeks, such as the [[Kalash people|Kalash]] and [[Hunza people|Hunza]] in [[Pakistan]], and the neighbouring [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2007}} &lt;!-- Kalasha and Nuristani not mentioned. Also book noted one person who likes to note his facial similiarities. IT did not say the general popn --&gt;

==Greco-Roman exchanges with India==

{{main|Roman trade with India}}
Although the political power of the Greeks had waned in the north, mainly due to nomadic invasions, trade relations between the Mediterranean and India continued for several centuries. The trade started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130&amp;nbsp;BCE kept on increasing, and according to [[Strabo]] (II.5.12), by the time of [[Augustus]], up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] to India. So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the Kushans for their own coinage, that [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India. In practice, this trade was still handled by Greek middlemen, as all the recorded names of ship captains for the period are Greek.

Also various exchanges are recorded between India and Rome during this period. In particular, embassies from India, as well as several missions from "[[Sramana]]s" to the Roman emperors are known (see [[Buddhism and the Roman world]]). Finally, Roman goods and works of art found their way to the Kushans, as archaeological finds in [[Begram]] have confirmed.

Greek representations and artistic styles, with some possible admixtures from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, continued to maintain a strong identity down to the 3rd‚Äì4th century, as indicated by the archaeological remains of such sites as [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, pp. 141‚Äì144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greco-Buddhist]] image of the Buddha was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 19).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous elements of Greek [[mythology]] and iconography, introduced in northwestern India by the Indo-Greeks through their coinage at the very least, were then adopted throughout Asia within a Buddhist context, especially along the [[Silk Road]]. The Japanese Buddhist deity [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the Silk Road. The image of [[Herakles]] was introduced in India with the coinage of Demetrius and several of his successors, used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]] the protector of the Buddha, and was then used in Central Asia, China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]])." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual and religious legacy==

{{main|Greco-Buddhism}}
[[File:VajrapaniAndMonks.jpg|thumb|The [[Zeus]]-like [[Vajrapani]] was chosen as a protector of the Buddha, art of [[Gandhara]], [[Guimet Museum]].]]
The impact of the Indo-Greeks on Indian thought and religion is unknown, although many influences have been suggested. Scholars believe that [[Mahayana Buddhism]] as a distinct movement began around the 1st century BCE in the North-western Indian subcontinent, corresponding to the time and place of Indo-Greek florescence. Intense multi-cultural influences have indeed been suggested in the appearance of Mahayana. According to [[Richard Foltz]], "Key formative influences on the early development of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Pure Land]] movements, which became so much part of [[East Asia]]n [[civilization]], are to be sought in Buddhism's earlier encounters along the [[Silk Road]]".&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road", p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Mahayana]] Buddhism emerged, it received "influences from popular Hindu devotional cults ([[bhakti]]), [[Persia]]n and [[Greco-Roman]] theologies which filtered into India from the northwest".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Lowenstein]], ''The Vision of the Buddha'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early Mahayana theories of reality and knowledge can be related to Greek philosophical schools of thought: Mahayana Buddhism has been described as "the form of Buddhism which (regardless of how Hinduized its later forms became) seems to have originated in the Greco-Buddhist communities of India, through a conflation of the Greek [[Democritus|Democritean]]-[[Sophism|Sophistic]]-[[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptical]] tradition with the rudimentary and unformalized empirical and skeptical elements already present in early Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, "The Shape of Ancient Thought", p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this view can hardly explain the origin of the bodhisattva ideal, already delineated in the Aagamas, which also already contained a well-developed theory of selflessness (anaatman) and emptiness (shunyaata), none of these essential Mahayaana tenets being traceable to Greek roots.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-71043-0003, Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolsheviks]]]]
'''Leninism''' is the [[political theory]] for the organisation of a [[revolution]]ary [[vanguard party]] and the achievement of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as political prelude to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999) pp. 476‚Äì477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by and named for the Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories, developed from [[Marxism]] and Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theories, for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the [[Russian Empire]] of the early 20th century. Functionally, the Leninist vanguard party was to provide the working class with the [[political consciousness]] (education and organisation) and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in Imperial Russia.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt; After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia and in establishing [[soviet democracy]] the Bolshevik r√©gime suppressed socialists who opposed the revolution, such as the [[Mensheviks]] and factions of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1,558.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Civil War]] (1917‚Äì1922) thus included [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] (1918‚Äì1924) that were suppressed in the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (RSFSR) before incorporation to the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) in 1922.

Leninism was composed as and for revolutionary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and originally was neither a rigorously proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. After the Russian Revolution and in ''[[History and Class Consciousness|History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics]]'' (1923), [[Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs]] developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices and ideology into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution (Leninism). As a political-science term, "Leninism" entered common usage in 1922 after infirmity ended Lenin's participation in governing the Russian Communist Party. At the Fifth Congress of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] in July 1924, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] popularized the term "Leninism" to denote "vanguard-party revolution". From 1917 to 1922, Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the [[Bolsheviks]], the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the [[working class]].  In the 1925‚Äì1929 period, [[Joseph Stalin]] established Leninism as the official and only legitimate form of Marxism in Russia by amalgamating the political philosophies as [[Marxism‚ÄìLeninism]], which then became the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state ideology of the Soviet Union]].

== Historical background ==
[[File:Luk√°cs Gy√∂rgy.jpg|thumb|200px|Hungarian philosopher [[Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs]] (c. 1952) codified the theory and practice of Leninism in ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923)]]
In the 19th century, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], called for the international political unification of the European [[working class]]es in order to achieve a [[communist revolution]] and proposed that because the socio-economic organization of [[communism]] was of a higher form than that of [[capitalism]], a workers' [[revolution]] would first occur in the economically advanced, industrialized countries. Marxist [[social democracy]] was strongest in Germany throughout the 19th century and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] inspired Lenin and other Russian Marxists.&lt;ref name=lih1&gt;{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Lars|title=Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in Context|year=2005|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-13120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721‚Äì1917)‚Äîuneven and combined economic development‚Äîfacilitated rapid and intensive industrialization, which produced a united, working-class [[proletariat]] in a predominantly rural, agrarian, peasant society. Moreover, because the industrialization was financed mostly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary [[bourgeoisie]] with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants (as occurred in the [[French Revolution]], 1789). Although Russia's [[political economy]] principally was agrarian and [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]], the task of democratic revolution therefore fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only [[social class]] capable of effecting land reform and democratization, in view that the Russian propertied classes would attempt to suppress any revolution, in town and country.

In April 1917, Lenin published the [[April Theses]], the political strategy of the [[October Revolution]] (7‚Äì8 November 1917), which proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event, but a fundamentally international event‚Äîthe first world socialist revolution. Thus Lenin's practical application of Marxism and working-class urban revolution to the social, political and economic conditions of the agrarian peasant society that was [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] Russia sparked the "revolutionary nationalism of the poor" to [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] the [[absolute monarchy]] of the three-hundred-year [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty (1613‚Äì1917).&lt;ref&gt;''Faces of Janus'' p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
In the course of developing the Russian application of [[Marxism]], the pamphlet ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916) presented Lenin's analysis of an economic development predicted by Karl Marx, namely that capitalism would become a [[global financial system]], wherein advanced industrial countries export [[financial capital]] to their [[Colonialism|colonial]] countries, to finance the exploitation of their natural resources and the labour of the native populations. Such [[Superprofit|superexploitation]] of the poor (undeveloped) countries allows the wealthy (developed) countries to maintain some homeland workers politically content with a slightly higher standard of living and so ensure peaceful labour‚Äìcapital relations in the capitalist homeland (see [[labour aristocracy]] and [[globalization]]). Hence, a [[proletarian revolution]] of workers and peasants could not occur in the developed capitalist countries while the imperialist global-finance system remained intact; thus an underdeveloped country would feature the first proletarian revolution; and in the early 20th century, [[Imperial Russia]] was the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system.&lt;ref name=tomasic&gt;Tomasic, D. "The Impact of Russian Culture on Soviet Communism" (1953), ''The Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 6, No. 4 December, pp. 808‚Äì809.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''United States of Europe Slogan'' (1915), Lenin said: {{quotation|[[Workers of the world, unite!]]‚ÄîUneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible, first in several, or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world.|''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V. I., ''United States of Europe Slogan'', ''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

In ''[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920), Lenin said: {{quotation|The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skillful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest, rift between the enemies, any conflict of interests among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest, opportunity of winning a mass ally, even though this ally is temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern [[scientific socialism]] in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies equally to the period before and after the proletariat has won political power.|''Collected Works'', vol. 31, p. 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder|chapter=No Compromises?|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1920|place=[[Soviet Union]]|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/index.htm|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch08.htm|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

== Leninist praxis ==
{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=all}}

=== The vanguard party ===
In Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), Marx and Engels presented the idea of the vanguard party as solely qualified to politically lead the proletariat in revolution: {{quotation|The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.}}

Hence, the purpose of the Leninist [[vanguard party]] is to establish a democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]; supported by the [[working class]], the vanguard party would lead the revolution to depose the incumbent [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government; and then transfer power of government to the working class, which change of ruling class‚Äîfrom [[bourgeoisie]] to [[proletariat]]‚Äîmakes possible the full development of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789‚Äì1945''. London:1994. pp. 462‚Äì464.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin proposed that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign because it was the only way that the [[proletariat]] could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties; and later by the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the "economic campaign" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the "political campaign" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive revolutionary leadership of the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik vanguard party]].

; Democratic centralism
As epitomised in the slogan "Freedom in Discussion, Unity in Action", Lenin followed the example of the [[First International]] (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864‚Äì1876) and organised the Bolsheviks as a [[Democratic centralism|democratically centralised]] vanguard party, wherein free political-speech was recognised legitimate until policy consensus. Afterwards, every member of the party would be expected to uphold the official policy established in consensus. In the pamphlet ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'' (1905), Lenin said: {{quotation|Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. [...] The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1905) ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, 1965, Moscow, Volume 10, pages 442-443. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/may/20c.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Full, inner-party democratic debate was Bolshevik Party practice under Lenin, even after the banning of party factions in 1921. Although a guiding influence in policy, Lenin did not exercise absolute power and continually debated and discussed to have his point of view accepted. Under Stalin, the inner-party practice of democratic free debate did not continue after the death of Lenin in 1924.

; Revolution
Before the Revolution, despite supporting political reform (including Bolsheviks elected to the [[Duma]], when opportune), Lenin proposed that [[capitalism]] could ultimately only be overthrown with revolution, not with gradual reforms‚Äîfrom within ([[Fabian Society|Fabianism]]) and from without ([[social democracy]])‚Äîwhich would fail because the ruling [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist social class]], who hold economic power (the [[means of production]]), determine the nature of political power in a bourgeois society.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1917) ''[[The State and Revolution]]'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 25, pp. 381-492. Available online at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/index.htm "The State and Revolution"]. ''Marxists.org''. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As epitomised in the slogan "For a Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry", a revolution in the underdeveloped [[Russian Empire]] required an allied proletariat of town and country (urban workers and peasants) because the urban workers would be too few to successfully assume power in the cities on their own. Moreover, owing to the [[Middle class|middle-class]] aspirations of much of the peasantry, [[Leon Trotsky]] proposed that the proletariat should lead the revolution as the only way for it to be truly socialist and democratic. Although Lenin initially disagreed with Trotsky's formulation, he adopted it before the [[Russian Revolution]] in October 1917.

=== Dictatorship of the proletariat ===
{{Soviet Union sidebar|history}}
{{main|Dictatorship of the proletariat}}
In the Russian socialist society, government by [[direct democracy]] was effected by elected [[soviet (council)|soviets]] (workers' councils), which "soviet government" form Lenin described as the manifestation of the Marxist "democratic dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, 1954. The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As political organisations, the soviets would comprise representatives of factory workers' and trade union committees, but would exclude capitalists as a social class in order to ensure the establishment of a proletarian government, by and for the working class and the peasants. About the political disenfranchisement of the Russian capitalist social classes, Lenin said that "depriving the exploiters of the franchise is a purely Russian question, and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in general. [...] In which countries [...] democracy for the exploiters will be, in one or another form, restricted [...] is a question of the specific national features of this or that capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky", from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, Moscow, Volume 28, 1974, pages 227‚Äì325. Available online at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/ Marxists.org]. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter five of ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' (1917), Lenin describes the dictatorship of the proletariat as such: {{quotation|[...] the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors. [...] An immense expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich [...] and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people‚Äîthis is the change which democracy undergoes during the 'transition' from capitalism to communism.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher. ''Lenin and the Russian Revolution'' (1971). Penguin Books. London p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About democracy, Lenin further stated the following in ''The State and Revolution'': {{quotation|Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, of the [[Exploitation of labour|exploiters]] and oppressors of the people‚Äîthis is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.|''Collected Works'', vol. 25, pp. 461‚Äì462&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx Engels Lenin on Scientific Socialism|publisher=Novosti Press Ajency Publishing House|place=Moscow|year=1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmeHGAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soviet constitutionalism was the collective government form of the Russian dictatorship of the proletariat, the opposite of the government form of the dictatorship of capital (privately owned means of production) practised in bourgeois democracies. In the soviet political system, the (Leninist) vanguard party would be one of many political parties competing for elected power.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution From Lenin to Stalin: 1917-1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the circumstances of the Red vs. White [[Russian Civil War]] and terrorism by the opposing political parties and in aid of the [[White Army|White Armies']] counter-revolution led to the Bolshevik government banning other parties, thus the vanguard party became the sole, legal political party in Russia. Lenin did not regard such political suppression as philosophically inherent to the dictatorship of the proletariat, yet the Stalinists retrospectively claimed that such factional suppression was original to Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. Lenin's Last Struggle. (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution, from Lenin to Stalin: 1917‚Äì1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
The Soviet Union nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive co-ordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted [[War Communism]] (1918‚Äì1921) as a necessary condition‚Äîadequate supplies of food and weapons‚Äîfor fighting the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917‚Äì1923).&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"/&gt; Later in March 1921, he established the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP, 1921‚Äì1929), which allowed measures of private commerce, internal free trade and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax under the management of state banks. The purpose of the NEP was to resolve food-shortage riots among the peasantry and allowed measures of private enterprise, wherein the [[profit motive]] encouraged the peasants to harvest the crops required to feed the people of town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many men (workers) to the counter-revolutionary Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' Chris Cook, editor (1983) Peter Bedrick Books:New York p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. ''The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Departments'', Report to the Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Departments, 17 October 1921, from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', 2nd English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 33, pp. 60‚Äì79. Available at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With the NEP, the socialist nationalisation of the economy could then be developed to industrialise Russia, strengthen the working class and raise standards of living, thus the NEP would advance socialism against capitalism. Lenin regarded the appearance of new socialist states in the developed countries as necessary to the strengthening Russia's economy and the eventual development of socialism. In that, he was encouraged by the [[German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919]], the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920 and industrial unrest in Britain, France and the United States.

=== National self-determination ===
Lenin recognized and accepted the existence of [[nationalism]] among oppressed peoples, advocated their national rights to [[self-determination]] and opposed the ethnic chauvinism of "[[Eurasianism|Greater Russia]]" because such [[ethnocentrism]] was a [[Cultural hegemony|cultural]] obstacle to establishing the proletarian dictatorship in the territories of the deposed [[Russian Empire]] (1721‚Äì1917).&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

[...] The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness. [...] Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

The internationalist philosophies of [[Bolshevism]] and of [[Marxism]] are based upon [[class struggle]] transcending nationalism, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[religion]], which are [[intellectualism|intellectual]] obstacles to class consciousness because the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ruling classes manipulated said cultural ''status quo'' to politically divide the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] working classes. To overcome the political barrier of nationalism, Lenin said it was necessary to acknowledge the existence of nationalism among oppressed peoples and to guarantee their national independence as the right of secession; and that based upon national self-determination, it was natural for socialist states to transcend nationalism and form a federation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. ''Lenin's Last Struggle'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Question of Nationalities, or "Autonomisation"'' (1923), Lenin said the following: {{quotation|[...] nothing holds up the development and strengthening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice; "offended" nationals are not sensitive to anything, so much as to the feeling of equality, and the violation of this equality, if only through negligence or jest‚Äîto the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

=== Socialist culture ===
The role of the Marxist vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal [[false consciousness]] of religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural ''status quo'' taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of peasant and worker. Influenced by Lenin, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party]] stated that the development of the socialist workers' culture should not be "hamstrung from above" and opposed the ''[[Proletkult]]'' (1917‚Äì1925) organisational control of the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Central Committee, ''On Proletcult Organisations'', ''Pravda'' No. 270, 1 December 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leninism after 1924 ==
{{Marxism‚ÄìLeninism sidebar|related}}
In post-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] Russia, [[Stalinism]] ([[socialism in one country]]) and [[Trotskyism]] ([[Permanent revolution|permanent world revolution]]) were the principal philosophies of [[communism]] that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism, thus within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], each ideological faction denied the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of the opposing faction.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000) p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Lenin vs. Stalin
Until shortly before his death, Lenin worked to counter the disproportionate political influence of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Communist Party and in the bureaucracy of the Soviet government, partly because of abuses he had committed against the populace of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and partly because the autocratic Stalin had accumulated administrative power disproportionate to his office of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. ''Lenin's Last Struggle''. (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1979"&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution From Lenin to Stalin: 1917-1929''. (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-action against Stalin aligned with Lenin's advocacy of the right of [[self-determination]] for the national and ethnic groups of the former Tsarist Empire, which was a key theoretic concept of Leninism.&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1979"/&gt; Lenin warned that Stalin has "unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution" and formed a factional bloc with [[Leon Trotsky]] to remove Stalin as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"&gt;Deutscher, Isaac 1959. ''The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921-1929'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. 1923-24 ''"Last Testament" Letters to the Congress'', in ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 36 pp. 593‚Äì611. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/testamnt/congress.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end followed proposals reducing the administrative powers of party posts in order to reduce bureaucratic influence upon the policies of the Communist Party. Lenin advised Trotsky to emphasize Stalin's recent bureaucratic alignment in such matters (e.g. undermining the anti-bureaucratic workers' and peasants' Inspection) and argued to depose Stalin as General Secretary. Despite advice to refuse "any rotten compromise", Trotsky did not heed Lenin's advice and General Secretary Stalin retained power over the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the soviet government.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

; Trotskyism vs. Stalinism
After Lenin's death (21 January 1924), Trotsky ideologically battled the influence of Stalin, who formed ruling blocs within the Russian Communist Party (with [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], then with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and then by himself) and so determined soviet government policy from 1924 onwards. The ruling blocs continually denied Stalin's opponents the right to organise as an opposition faction within the party‚Äîthus the re-instatement of democratic centralism and free speech within the Communist Party were key arguments of Trotsky's [[Left Opposition]] and the later Joint Opposition.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, Leon 1927. ''Platform of the Joint Opposition''. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1927/opposition/index.htm Marxists.rog]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leon Trotsky]] was exiled from Russia after losing to [[Joseph Stalin]] in the factional politics of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]]]
In the course of instituting government policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]] (adopted 1925), wherein the Soviet Union would establish [[socialism]] upon Russia's economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). Conversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the Soviet Union and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries that had arisen in the developed world‚Äîwhich was essential for maintaining Soviet democracy‚Äîin 1924 much undermined by [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and [[White Army|counter-revolution]]. Furthermore, Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]] proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would go further towards dismantling [[Feudalism|feudal]] r√©gimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should politically ally with peasant political organisations, but not with capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where communists were too few. However, said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the [[Northern Expedition]] portion of the Chinese Revolution (1925‚Äì1927), wherein it resulted in the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Kuomintang]]'s massacre of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. Despite the failure, Stalin's policy of mixed-ideology political alliances nonetheless became [[Communist International|Comintern]] policy.

; The Oppositionists
[[File:Stalin-Lenin-Kalinin-1919.jpg|thumb|The "[[Old Bolshevik]]s" (Stalin, Lenin and [[Mikhail Kalinin]], pictured in 1919) were members of the Bolshevik Party before the [[Russian Revolution]]]]
Until exiled from Russia in 1929, Trotsky helped develop and led the Left Opposition (and the later Joint Opposition) with members of the Workers' Opposition, the Decembrists and (later) the Zinovievists.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt; Trotskyism ideologically predominated the political platform of the Left Opposition, which demanded the restoration of soviet democracy, the expansion of democratic centralism in the Communist Party, national industrialisation, international permanent revolution and socialist internationalism. The Trotskyist demands countered Stalin's political dominance of the Russian Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the "[[Cult of personality|cult of Lenin]]", the rejection of permanent revolution and the doctrine of socialism in one country. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing capitalist [[kulak]] interests in the countryside and destroying them. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia, but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of the policy towards the kulak social class of wealthy peasants and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described the vacillating Stalinist policy as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, L.D. (1938) ''The Revolution Betrayed''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and of the Trotskyists in Russia, by means of slander, [[antisemitism]], programmed [[censorship]], expulsions, exile (internal and external) and imprisonment. The anti‚ÄìTrotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the [[Moscow Trials]] (1936‚Äì1938), which were part of the [[Great Purge]] of [[Old Bolshevik]]s (who had led the Revolution).&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin, Vadim Z. ''Stalin's Terror of 1937-1938: Political Genocide in the USSR''. (2009) translated to English by Frederick S. Choate, from the Russian-language ''Party of the Executed'' by Vadim Z. Rogovin.&lt;/ref&gt; Once established as ruler of the Soviet Union, General Secretary Stalin re-titled the official socialism in one country doctrine as [[Marxism‚ÄìLeninism]] to establish ideologic continuity with Leninism whilst opponents continued calling it Stalinism.

== Philosophic successors ==
In political practice, Leninism ([[Vanguard party|vanguard-party]] revolution), despite its origin as communist revolutionary praxis, was adopted throughout the political spectrum.
* In China, the [[Communist Party of China]] is organised as a Leninist vanguard party, based upon [[Maoism]] (Mao Zedong Thought), the Chinese practical application of [[Marxism‚ÄìLeninism]], that is [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]].&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Yongnian, ''The Chinese Communist Party as Organizational Emperor'' (2009) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Singapore, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) was organised as a Leninist political party featuring internal democracy. The PAP initiated single-party dominance in the government and popular politics of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wilson, ''Economic growth and development in Singapore'' (2002) p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, the practical application of Maoism to the socio-economic conditions of  [[Third World]] countries produced revolutionary vanguard parties, such as the [[Communist Party of Peru ‚Äì Red Fatherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Roberts, ''Deepening Democracy?: The Modern Left and Social Movements  in Chile and Peru'' (1988) pp 288‚Äì289.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In ''The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution'' (1918), Marxist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] criticized the Bolsheviks and their policies for: the suppression of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|All Russian Constituent Assembly]] (January 1918); the [[Partition (politics)|partitioning]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal estates]] to the peasant communes; and the right of self-determination of every national people of the Russias. Luxemburg said that the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create great dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratisation]] that would arise to administrate the oversized country that was Bolshevik Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg|title=The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution (Rosa Luxemburg, 1918)|publisher=Libcom.org|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of expedient revolutionary practise, Lenin criticised  in ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920) the political and ideological complaints of the anti-Bolshevik critics who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the political-left of Lenin.

In Marxist philosophy, the term "[[left communism]]" identifies a range of communist political perspectives that are left-wing among communists. Left communism criticizes the ideology that the [[Bolshevik Party]] practiced as a revolutionary vanguard at certain periods of their history. Ideologically, left communists present their perspective and approach as more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and more oriented to the [[proletariat]] than it is the Leninism of the [[Communist International]] at their first (1919) and second (1920) congresses. Proponents of left communism include [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek]], [[Otto R√ºhle]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Advance Without Authority': Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals'' by Chamsy Ojeili, Democracy &amp; Nature, vol. 7, no. 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Left communism#Dutch‚ÄìGerman left communism until 1933|Dutch‚ÄìGerman communist left]] has been most critical of Lenin and Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/gorter/1920/open-letter/index.htm "Herman Gorter, Open Letter to Comrade Lenin, 1920"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1938/lenin/ "Anton Pannekoek: Lenin As Philosopher (1938)"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1939/ruhle01.htm "R√ºhle: Struggle Against Bolshevism (Intro)"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Left communism#Italian left communism 1926‚Äì1939|Italian communist left]] instead still identified as Leninists; Bordiga said: "All this work of demolishing opportunism and "deviationism" (Lenin: ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'') is today the basis of party activity. The party follows revolutionary tradition and experiences in this work during these periods of revolutionary reflux and the proliferation of opportunist theories which had as their violent and inflexible opponents Marx, Engels, Lenin and the Italian Left.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1951/fundamental-theses.htm "Fundamental Theses of the Party by Amadeo Bordiga 1951"].&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Mattick continues in the [[Council communism|council communist]] tradition which begun by the Dutch‚ÄìGerman left and so is also critical of Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1935/lenin-legend.htm "The Leninn Legend by Paul Mattick"].&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary left-communist organisations, such as the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]] and the [[International Communist Current]], view Lenin as an important and influential theorist, but remain critical of Leninism as political praxis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2017-10-06/the-significance-of-the-russian-revolution-for-today "The Significance of the Russian Revolution for Today"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2015-01-21/lenin-s-legacy "Lenin's Legacy"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.internationalism.org/ir/96/leninists "Have we become "Leninists"? - part 1"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bordigism|Bordigist]] ideology of the [[International Communist Party]] follow Bordiga's strict adherence to Leninism. The recent [[communisation]] current has been influenced by left communism and is critical of Lenin and Leninism, being more ideologically aligned with the Dutch‚ÄìGerman left than the Italian left, wherein the theorist of communisation [[Gilles Dauv√©]] criticised Leninism as a "by-product of [[Kautskyism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/files/Gilles%20Dauv%C3%A9-%20The%20Renegade%20Kautsky%20and%20his%20Disciple%20Lenin.pdf "Gilles Dauv√© - The Renegade Kautsky and his Disciple Lenin"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Soviet Union Versus Socialism'' (1986), [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that [[Stalinism]] was a logical extension of Leninism, and not an ideological deviation from Lenin's policies. It resulted in [[collectivization]] and enforced the law with a [[police state]], functions of the state continually supported with a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/the-other-killing-machine.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Other Killing Machine|author=Steven Merritt Miner|date=11 May 2003|publisher=''The New York Times''|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm|author=Noam Chomsky|title=The Soviet Union Versus Socialism|publisher=Our Generation|date=Spring‚ÄìSummer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0703-021, Schwerin, Indianistiktreffen.jpg|thumb|Eastern German Living history at an "Indianistikmeeting" 1982 in [[Schwerin]]]]
[[File:Gu√©delon - mai 2014 - 24.JPG|thumb|The [[Gu√©delon Castle]] in France is a castle currently built using only medieval construction techniques, tools, costumes and local materials.]]
Living history approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),&lt;ref Name="Ban"&gt;Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem H√§kelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer √úberblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, K√∂ln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beitr√§gen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander H√§usler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt;

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. ‚Äì 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Landshut Wedding]] or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt; started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: 2008, S. 35‚Äì39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Borries, Jens-Uwe Fischer: ''Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/ Main 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Br, Gabriele Wilczek 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is as well part of western Germany folklore and tries for a high level of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/zu-besuch-bei-deutschen-indianern/a-16716293 Zu Besuch bei deutschen "Indianern"] Deutsche Welle 07.05.2013, Ananda Grade&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
[[File:Vikingtent.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Viking encampment.]]

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In education==
[[File:Highlander-actor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A reenactor from a living history group.]]
[[File:Lincoln living.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Abraham Lincoln in present time.]]
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history ‚Äì the school ‚Äì with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  ‚ÄúInterpreters‚Äù are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual‚Äôs personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered ‚Äúfolk artifacts,‚Äù which are grouped under the heading of ‚Äúmaterial culture.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Experiential learning]], "About"&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], ‚ÄúThat the Future May Learn from the Past,‚Äù proclaims the site‚Äôs commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled ‚ÄúApplied History,‚Äù in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.&lt;ref&gt;James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, it was thought that the Long Peace was a unique result of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Saperstein1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaddis1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=John Lewis|title=The Cold War, the Long Peace, and the Future|journal=Diplomatic History|volume=16|issue=2|year=1992|pages=234‚Äì246|issn=0145-2096|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1992.tb00499.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffield2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffield|first1=John S.|title=Explaining the Long Peace in Europe: the contributions of regional security regimes|journal=Review of International Studies|volume=20|issue=04|year=2009|pages=369|issn=0260-2105|doi=10.1017/S0260210500118170}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Cold War ended the same trends continued in what has also been called the "New Peace".&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423‚Äì451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period has exhibited more than a quarter of a century of even greater stability and peacefulness, and has also shown continued improvements in related measurements such as the number of coups, the amount of repression, and the durability of peace settlements.&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"/&gt; Though [[civil war]]s and lesser military conflicts have occurred, there has been a continued absence of direct conflict between any of the largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP economies]]; instead, wealthier countries have fought limited small-scale regional conflicts with poorer countries. Conflict involving smaller economies have also gradually tapered off.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; Overall, the number of international wars decreased from a rate of six per year in the 1950s to one per year in the 2000s, and the number of fatalities decreased from 240 reported deaths per million to less than 10 reported deaths per million.&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors cited as reasons for the Long Peace have included the [[Nuclear deterrence|deterrence effect]] of [[nuclear weapons]], the economic incentives towards cooperation caused by [[globalization]] and [[international trade]], the [[Democratic peace theory|worldwide increase in the number of democracies]], the [[World Bank]]'s efforts in [[poverty alleviation|reduction of poverty]], and the effects of the [[UN Women|empowerment of women]] and [[United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping by the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"/&gt; However, none of these are sufficient explanations on their own, so additional or combined factors are likely. Other proposed explanations have included the proliferation of [[human rights]], increasing [[education]] and [[quality of life]], changes in the way that people view conflicts (such as the presumption that [[wars of aggression]] are unjustified), the success of [[non-violent action]], and demographic factors such as the reduction in birthrates.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InglehartPuranen2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inglehart|first1=Ronald F|last2=Puranen|first2=Bi|last3=Welzel|first3=Christian|title=Declining willingness to fight for one‚Äôs country|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=52|issue=4|year=2015|pages=418‚Äì434|issn=0022-3433|doi=10.1177/0022343314565756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', [[Steven Pinker]] says that this is part of a trend that has continued since the beginning of recorded history,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined|date=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=9780670022953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other experts have made similar arguments.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua S. Goldstein|title=Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-e9vDwAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-29859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is general agreement among experts that we are in a Long Peace and that wars have declined since the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; Pinker's broader thesis has been contested.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; Critics have also said that we need a longer period of relative peace in order to be certain, or have emphasized minor reversals in specific trends, such as the increase in battle deaths between 2011 and 2014 due to the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"/&gt; While Pinker's work has received some publicity, most information about the Long Peace and related trends remains outside public awareness, and some data demonstrates a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt;

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizi√®me si√®cle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450‚Äì1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II

New York: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; and "a recognized category of [[History of literature|literary history]]", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slu.edu/Documents/arts_sciences/english/Long%2019th%20Century.pdf |title=Long 19th Century |publisher=slu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering, "French Society: 1589‚Äì1715 ‚Äì  the long seventeenth century", E. Anthony Wrigley, "British population during the ‚Äòlong‚Äô eighteenth century, 1680‚Äì1840", or D. Blackbourn, "The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780‚Äì1918".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treasedademin.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/26032413.pdf |title=French Society: 1589‚Äì1715 |publisher=treasedademin |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/wrigley/ |title=Department of Geography, Cambridge ¬ª Tony Wrigley ‚Äì British population during the 'long' eighteenth century, 1680-1840 |publisher=Geog.cam.ac.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2349 |title=H-Net Reviews - David Blackbourn.

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789‚Äì1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848‚Äì1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875‚Äì1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801‚Äì1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914‚Äì1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B. Schwartz|author4=Marc Jason Gilbert|authorlink=Peter Stearns|authorlink2=Michael Adas|authorlink3=Stuart B. Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">The '''Mark Lynton History Prize''' is an annual award in the amount of $10,000 given to a book "of history, on any subject, that best combines intellectual or scholarly distinction with felicity of expression".&lt;ref name=Lukas&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/Awards/AwardsAtAGlance/JAnthonyLukasPrizeProject.aspx|publisher=Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is one of three awards given as part of the [[J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize]] administered by the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=http://nieman.harvard.edu/awards/j-anthony-lukas-prize-project/|website=Neiman Foundation|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Columbia University School of Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=https://journalism.columbia.edu/lukas|website=Columbia Journalism School|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is named in honor of [[Mark Lynton]], a refugee from [[Nazi Germany]], Second World War officer, and automobile industry executive. In 1939 Lynton was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] German-born student, studying history at Cambridge when he and other German nationals were rounded up and interned in detention camps in England and Canada as [[enemy alien]]s, suspected of being Nazi sympathizers. When Lynton was released he joined the [[British Army]], became a tank commander, and was later promoted to Major in the occupying force, [[British Army of the Rhine|Army of the Rhine]], where he helped interrogate high-ranking Nazi officers. Lynton memorialized his odyssey in his memoir, ''Accidental Journey: A Cambridge Internee's Memoir of World War II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynton|first1=Mark|title=Accidental journey : a Cambridge internee's memoir of World War II|date=1995|publisher=Overlook Press|location=Woodstock [u.a.]|isbn=978-0879515775|pages=276|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was established by his wife, Marion, children, Lili and [[Michael Lynton|Michael]], and grandchildren, Lucinda, Eloise Lynton and Maisie Lynton, to honor Lynton who was an avid reader of history. The Lynton family has underwritten the Lukas Prize Project since its inception in 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29785">{{About|the modern myth that medieval Europeans believed that Earth was flat|mythologies involving the actual belief in a Flat Earth|Flat Earth}}
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|270px|The famous "Flat Earth" [[Flammarion engraving]] originates with Flammarion's 1888 ''L'atmosph√®re: m√©t√©orologie populaire'' (p. 163)]]

The '''myth of the flat Earth''' is a modern misconception that Earth was widely believed to be [[flat Earth|flat]] rather than [[spherical Earth|spherical]] during the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.{{sfn|Russell|1991|p=3}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint, which had been first expressed by the Ancient Greeks. From at least the 14th century, belief in a flat Earth among educated Europeans was almost nonexistent, despite fanciful depictions in art, such as the exterior of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s famous triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', in which a disc-shaped Earth is shown floating inside a transparent sphere.{{sfn|Gombrich|1969|pp=162‚Äì170}}

According to [[Stephen Jay Gould]], "there never was a period of 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars (regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now). Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology."{{sfn|Gould|1997}} Historians of science [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] point out that "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference".{{sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|pp=338‚Äì354}}

Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] says the flat-Earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over biological evolution. Russell claims "with extraordinary few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat", and ascribes popularization of the flat-Earth myth to histories by [[John William Draper]], [[Andrew Dickson White]], and [[Washington Irving]].{{sfn|Russell|1997}}{{sfn|Russell|1991}}{{sfn|Russell|1993}}

== History ==
In ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth|Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians]]'', Jeffrey Russell describes the Flat Earth theory as a fable used to [[wikt:impugn|impugn]] pre-modern civilization and [[creationism]].{{sfn|Russell|1991}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}}

James Hannam wrote:

{{bq|1=The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the Earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching.  But it gained currency in the 19th century, thanks to inaccurate histories such as John William Draper's ''History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science'' (1874) and Andrew Dickson White's ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896). Atheists and agnostics championed the [[conflict thesis]] for their own purposes, but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;James Hannam. [http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Science-Versus-Christianity.html "Science Versus Christianity?"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early modern period===
French dramatist [[Cyrano de Bergerac (writer)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] in chapter 5 of his ''[[Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon]]'' (published 2 years posthumously in 1657) quotes [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] as saying "that in his day and age the Earth was as flat as a stove lid and that it floated on water like half of a sliced orange."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue29/cyrano5.html The Other World The Societies and Governments of the Moon], translated by Donald Webb&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in his ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''&lt;ref name=burton&gt;Second Partition, Section 2, Member 3 "Air Rectified. With a Digression of the Air" [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt The Anatomy of Melancholy]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:
{{bq|1=[[Vergilius of Salzburg|Virgil]], sometime bishop of Salzburg (as Aventinus ''anno'' 745 relates), by [[Saint Boniface|Bonifacius]], bishop of [[Mainz|Mentz]], was therefore called in question, because he held antipodes (which they made a doubt whether Christ died for) and so by that means took away the seat of hell, or so contracted it, that it could bear no proportion to heaven, and contradicted that opinion of Austin [St. Augustine], Basil, Lactantius, that held the Earth round as a [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]] (whom [[Jos√© de Acosta|Acosta]] and common experience more largely confute) but not as a ball.}}

Thus, there is evidence that accusations of Flatearthism, though somewhat whimsical (Burton ends his digression with a legitimate quotation of St. Augustine: "Better doubt of things concealed, than to contend about uncertainties, where Abraham's bosom is, and hell fire"&lt;ref name=burton/&gt;) were used to discredit opposing authorities several centuries before the 19th. Another early mention in literature is [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s comedy ''Erasmus Montanus'' (1723). Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants hold it to be flat. He is not allowed to marry his fianc√©e until he cries "The earth is flat as a pancake". In Thomas Jefferson's book ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784), framed as answers to a series of questions (queries), Jefferson uses the "Query" regarding religion to attack the idea of state-sponsored official religions. In the chapter, Jefferson relates a series of official erroneous beliefs about nature forced upon people by authority. One of these is the episode of [[Galileo]]'s struggles with authority, which Jefferson erroneously frames in terms of the shape of the globe:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson, Thomas]]. [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/notes-on-the-state-of-virginia-query-xvii-religion/ Notes on the State of Virginia, Query regarding RELIGION]. Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|1=Government is just as infallible too when it fixes systems in physics. Galileo was sent to the inquisition for affirming that the Earth was a sphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]], and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, the Earth became a globe, and Descartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|vortex]].}}

===19th century===
The 19th century was a period in which the perception of an antagonism between religion and science was especially strong. The disputes surrounding the [[Reaction to Darwin's theory|Darwinian revolution]] contributed to the birth of the [[conflict thesis]],{{sfn|Gould|1997}} a view of history according to which any interaction between [[religion]] and [[science]] would almost inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Wilson writes about the development of the conflict thesis in "The Historiography of Science and Religion" {{Harvnb|Wilson|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irving's biography of Columbus====
In 1828, Washington Irving's highly romanticised biography, ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'',{{sfn|Irving|1861}} was published and mistaken by many for a scholarly work.{{sfn|Russell|1991|pp=51‚Äì56}} In Book II, Chapter IV of this biography, Irving gave a largely fictional account of the meetings of a commission established by the Spanish sovereigns to examine [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s proposals. One of his more fanciful embellishments was a highly unlikely tale that the more ignorant and bigoted members on the commission had raised scriptural objections to Columbus's assertions that the Earth was spherical.{{sfn|Irving|1861|p=90}}

The issue in the 1490s was not the shape of the Earth, but its size, and the position of the east coast of Asia, as Irving in fact points out. Historical estimates from [[Ptolemy]] onwards placed the coast of Asia about 180¬∞ east of the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, ''Geography'', book 1:14.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus adopted an earlier (and rejected) distance of 225¬∞, added 28¬∞ (based on [[Marco Polo|Marco Polo's]] travels), and then placed [[Japan]] another 30¬∞ further east. Starting from [[Cape St. Vincent]] in [[Portugal]], Columbus made [[Eurasia]] stretch 283¬∞ to the east, leaving the [[Atlantic]] as only 77¬∞ wide. Since he planned to leave from the Canaries (9¬∞ further west), his trip to Japan would only have to cover 68¬∞ of longitude.{{sfn|Morison|1942|page=65}}{{sfn|Nunn|Edwards|1924|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n40/mode/1up 27‚Äì30]}}

Columbus mistakenly assumed that the mile referred to in the Arabic estimate of 56‚Öî miles for the size of a degree was the same as the actually much shorter Italian mile of {{convert|1,480|m|mi}}.  His estimate for the size of the degree and for the circumference of the Earth was therefore about 25% too small.{{sfn|Nunn|Edwards|1924|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n14/mode/1up 1‚Äì2], [https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n30/mode/1up 17‚Äì18]}} The combined effect of these mistakes was that Columbus estimated the distance to Japan to be only about 5,000&amp;nbsp;km (or only to the eastern edge of the [[Caribbean]]) while the true figure is about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km. The Spanish scholars may not have known the exact distance to the east coast of Asia, but they believed that it was significantly further than Columbus's projection; and this was the basis of the criticism in Spain and Portugal, whether academic or amongst mariners, of the proposed voyage.

The disputed point was not the shape of the Earth, nor the idea that going west would eventually lead to Japan and China, but the ability of European ships to sail that far across open seas. The small ships of the day (Columbus's three ships varied between 20.5 and 23.5 m ‚Äì or 67 to 77 feet ‚Äì in length and carried about 90 men) simply could not carry enough food and water to reach Japan. The ships barely reached the eastern Caribbean islands. Already the crews were mutinous, not because of some fear of "sailing off the edge", but because they were running out of food and water with no chance of any new supplies within sailing distance. They were on the edge of starvation.{{sfn|Morison|1942|pp=209, 211}} What saved Columbus was the unknown existence of the Americas precisely at the point he thought he would reach Japan. His ability to resupply with food and water from the Caribbean islands allowed him to return safely to Europe. Otherwise his crews would have died, and the ships foundered.

====Advocates for science====

In 1834, a few years after the publication of Irving's book, [[Jean Antoine Letronne]], a French academic of strong antireligious ideas, misrepresented the [[church fathers]] and their medieval successors as believing in a flat earth in his ''On the Cosmographical Ideas of the Church Fathers''.{{sfn|Russell|1997}}{{sfn|Letronne|1883}} Then in 1837, the English philosopher of science [[William Whewell]], in his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', identified [[Lactantius]], author of ''Institutiones Divinae'' (c. 310), and [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], author of ''[[Christian Topography]]'' (c. 548), as evidence of a medieval belief in a Flat Earth. Lactantius had been ridiculed much earlier by [[Copernicus]] in ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' of 1543 as someone who "Speaks quite childishly about the Earth's shape, when he mocks those who declared that the Earth has the form of a globe".

Other historians quickly followed Whewell, although they could identify few other examples.{{sfn|Gould|1997|p=42}} The American chemist [[John William Draper]] wrote a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), employing the claim that the early Church fathers thought the Earth was flat as evidence of the hostility of the Church to the advancement of science.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=10‚Äì11}} The story of widespread religious belief in the flat Earth was repeated by [[Andrew Dickson White]] in his 1876 ''The Warfare of Science''{{sfn|White|1876|pp=10‚Äì22}} and elaborated twenty years later in his two-volume ''History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'', which exaggerated the number and significance of medieval flat Earthers to support White's model of warfare between dogmatic theology and scientific progress.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=12‚Äì13}}  As Draper and White's metaphor of ongoing warfare between the scientific progress of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the religious obscurantism of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" became widely accepted, it spread the idea of medieval belief in the flat Earth.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=13‚Äì14}}

The widely circulated engraving of a man poking his head through the firmament surrounding the Earth to view the [[Empyrean]], executed in the style of the 16th century, was published in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s ''L'Atmosph√®re: M√©t√©orologie Populaire'' (Paris, 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;163).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/kvmagruder/flatEarth/source.html|title=History_of_Science_Collections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving illustrates the statement in the text that a medieval missionary claimed that "he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met". In its original form, the engraving included a decorative border that places it in the 19th century. In later publications, some of which claimed that the engraving dates to the 16th century, the border was removed.

=== 20th century and onward ===

[[File:Boorstin discoverers.jpg|thumb|right|Front Cover of Daniel Boorstin's ''[[The Discoverers]]'' (1983), bearing a copy of the Flammarion engraving]]
Since the early 20th century, a number of books and articles have documented the flat earth error as one of a number of widespread misconceptions in popular [[Medievalism|views of the Middle Ages]]. Both E.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Tillyard's book ''The Elizabethan World Picture'' and C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis' ''The Discarded Image'' are devoted to a broad survey of how the universe was viewed in Renaissance and medieval times, and both extensively discuss how the educated classes knew the world was round. Lewis draws attention to the fact that in Dante's [[Divine Comedy|''The Divine Comedy'']] about an epic voyage through hell, purgatory, and heaven, the earth is spherical with gravity being towards the center of the earth. As the Devil is frozen in a block of ice in the center of the earth, Dante and Virgil climb down the Devil's torso, but up from the Devil's waist to his feet, as his waist is at the center of the earth.

[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] rebutted the prevalence of belief in the flat Earth in a monograph{{sfn|Russell|1991}} and two papers.{{sfn|Russell|1993}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}} Louise Bishop states that virtually every thinker and writer of the 1000-year medieval period affirmed the spherical shape of the Earth.{{sfn|Bishop|2008|p=99}}

Although the misconception was frequently refuted in historical scholarship since at least 1920, it persisted in popular culture and in some school textbooks into the 21st century. An American schoolbook by Emma Miller Bolenius published in 1919 has this introduction to the suggested reading for [[Columbus Day]] (12 October):
{{bq|1=When Columbus lived, people thought that the earth was flat. They believed the Atlantic Ocean to be filled with monsters large enough to devour their ships, and with fearful waterfalls over which their frail vessels would plunge to destruction. Columbus had to fight these foolish beliefs in order to get men to sail with him. He felt sure the earth was round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bolenius|1919}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Garwood|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Previous editions of [[Thomas A. Bailey|Thomas Bailey]]'s ''[[The American Pageant]]'' stated that "The superstitious sailors [of Columbus's crew]&amp;nbsp;... grew increasingly mutinous&amp;nbsp;... because they were fearful of sailing over the edge of the world"; however, no such historical account is known.{{sfn|Loewen|1996|p=56}} &lt;!-- Can someone confirm whether the 13th edition of The American Pageant (2006) still contains this sentence? --&gt;

A 2009 survey of schoolbooks from Austria and Germany showed that the Flat Earth myth became dominant in the second half of the 20th century and persists in most historical textbooks for German and Austrian schools.{{sfn|Bernhard|2014}}

As recently as 1983 [[Daniel Boorstin]] published a historical survey, ''[[The Discoverers]]'', which presented the Flammarion engraving on its cover and proclaimed that "from AD 300 to at least 1300&amp;nbsp;... Christian faith and dogma suppressed the useful image of the world that had been so&amp;nbsp;... scrupulously drawn by ancient geographers."{{sfn|Boorstin|1983|p=100}} Boorstin dedicated a chapter to the flat earth, in which he portrayed [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] as the founder of Christian geography.{{sfn|Boorstin|1983|pp=108‚Äì109}}  The flat earth model has often been incorrectly supposed to be church doctrine by those who wish to portray the Catholic Church as being anti-progress or hostile to scientific inquiry.  This narrative has been repeated even in academic circles, such as in April 2016, when [[Boston College]] theology professor and ex-priest [[Thomas Groome]] erroneously stated that "the Catholic Church never said the earth is round, but just stopped saying it was flat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-long-awaited-document-on-the-family-pope-francis-offers-hope-to-divorced-catholics-says-no-to-gay-marriage/2016/04/07/87be6dae-fb42-11e5-813a-90ab563f0dde_story.html|title=Pope Francis offers hope to divorced Catholics, says no to gay marriage|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/anthony.faiola|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1937 popular song [[They All Laughed (song)|''They All Laughed'']] contains the couplet "They all laughed at Christopher Columbus/When he said the world was round". In the Warner Bros. ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon ''[[Hare We Go]]'' (1951) Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand the Catholic quarrel about the shape of the Earth; the king states the Earth is flat. In Walt Disney's 1963 animation ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', wizard [[Merlin]] (who has traveled into the future) explains to [[King Arthur|a young Arthur]] that "man will discover in centuries to come" that the Earth is round, and rotates.

==Historiography of the flat Earth myth==

[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Columbus Before the Council of Salamanca (1487) CropEnh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Columbus Doors|Ornamental door]] (1871) at the US Capitol depicting the Council at Salamanca]]
Historical writers have identified a number of historical circumstances that contributed to the origin and widespread acceptance of the flat-earth myth. American historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] traced the nineteenth-century origins of what he called the Flat Error to a group of anticlerical French scholars, particularly to [[Antoine-Jean Letronne]] and, indirectly, to his teachers [[Jean-Baptiste Gail]] and [[Edme Mentelle]]. Mentelle had described the Middle Ages as twelve ignorant centuries of "profound night", a theme exemplified by the flat-earth myth in Letronne's "On the Cosmological Opinions of the Church Fathers".{{sfn|Russell|1993|pp=344‚Äì345}}

[[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Edward Grant]] saw a fertile ground for the development of the flat-Earth myth in a more general assault upon the Middle Ages and upon scholastic thought, which can be traced back to [[Francesco Petrarch]] in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Grant|2001|pp=329‚Äì345}}  Grant sees "one of the most extreme assaults against the Middle Ages" in [[John William Draper|Draper's]] ''History of the Intellectual Development of Europe'',{{sfn|Grant|2001|p=335}} which appeared a decade before Draper presented the flat-Earth myth in his ''History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science''.{{sfn|Draper|1874|pp=63‚Äì65, 154‚Äì5, 160‚Äì161}}

Andrew Dickson White's motives were more complex.  As the first president of [[Cornell University]], he had advocated that it be established without any religious ties but be "an asylum for science".  In addition, he was a strong advocate for Darwinism, saw religious figures as the main opponents of the Darwinian evolution, and sought to project that conflict of theology and science back through the entire Christian Era.{{sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|pp=338‚Äì352}}  But as some historians have pointed out, the nineteenth-century conflict over Darwinism incorporated disputes over the relative authority of professional scientists and clergy in the fields of science and education.{{sfn|Turner|1978}}  White made this concern manifest in the preface to his ''History of the Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom'', where he explained the lack of advanced instruction in many American colleges and universities by their "sectarian character".{{sfn|White|1917|p=vii}}

The flat-Earth myth, like other myths, took on artistic form in the many works of art displaying Columbus defending the sphericity of the Earth before the Council of [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]]. American artists depicted a forceful Columbus challenging the "prejudices, the mingled ignorance and erudition, and the pedantic bigotry" of the churchmen.  Abrams sees this image of a Romantic hero, a practical man of business, and a Yankee go-getter as crafted to appeal to nineteenth-century Americans.{{sfn|Abrams|1993|p=89}}

Russell suggests that the flat-earth error was able to take such deep hold on the modern imagination because of prejudice and [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]].  He specifically mentions "the Protestant prejudice against the Middle Ages for Being Catholic&amp;nbsp;... the Rationalist prejudice against Judeo-Christianity as a whole", and "the assumption of the superiority of 'our' views to those of older cultures".{{sfn|Russell|1993|p=347}}

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854‚Äì1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646‚Äì1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800‚Äì1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000‚Äì1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html –ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –±–æ—Ä—å–±—ã —Å –ª–∂–µ–Ω–∞—É–∫–æ–π (–æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–∏—É–º–µ –†–ê–ù)] ‚Äî {{Interlanguage link multi|–í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—É–∫|ru}} 1999, —Ç–æ–º&amp;nbsp;69, ‚Ññ&amp;nbsp;10, —Å.&amp;nbsp;879‚Äî904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM –ß–µ–º —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞–µ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É –ª–∂–µ–Ω–∞—É–∫–∞?

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities‚Äîin short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt.

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = –ê.–¢.–§–æ–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ | author2 = –ì.–í.–ù–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π | title = –î–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞ –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–æ–π XII –≤–µ–∫–∞ | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = –§–æ–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ê.–¢. |author2=–ù–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ì.–í.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494‚Äì1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317‚Äì347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis P√©tau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its ‚Äúastronomical component‚Äù is not simply exceptionally important ‚Äì it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30‚Äì50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don‚Äôt allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187‚Äì194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808‚Äì09). Fomenko says that Blair‚Äôs tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of ‚ÄúScaligerite activity‚Äù which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth‚ÄìMoon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179‚Äì200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700‚Äì1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (¬±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (¬±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]‚Äîtwo horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]‚Äîand comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30‚Äì40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm –ù–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ì. –ö–∞—Å–ø–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –ø–æ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–µ ¬´–ù–æ–≤–æ–π –•—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏¬ª]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html "Garry Kasparov and New Chronology"] ''Chess Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; Billington writes that the theory "might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that [[Dark Ages (historiography)#Modern popular use|art and culture died during the Dark Ages]] and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317‚Äì347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:–ê–Ω—Ç–∏–ø—Ä–µ–º–∏—è ¬´–ê–±–∑–∞—Ü¬ª|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

Reimer, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume46/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v46_n3_1029_1058_v.pdf "INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon Age Calibration, 0‚Äì26 Cal Kyr BP"], ''Radiocarbon'' 46 (2004): 1029-1058; data online at http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal04%20files/intcal04.14c .&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, K√ºppers M (2004).

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—è –∏ —Å–∏–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–º ‚Äú–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏‚Äù] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã —Å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π (–≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—è –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∏ –ê–ª—å–º–∞–≥–µ—Å—Ç–∞)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos‚Äô Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1‚Äì71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny''''' is a 1999 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author argues that [[biological evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]] are shaped and directed first and foremost by "non-zero-sumness" [[i.e.]], the prospect of creating new interactions that are not [[zero-sum]].&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-01/&gt;

== Thesis ==
The principal argument of ''Nonzero'' is to demonstrate that natural selection results in increasing complexity within the world and greater rewards for cooperation.  Since, as Wright puts it, the realization of such prospects is dependent upon increased levels of [[globalization]], communication, cooperation, and trust, what is thought of as human intelligence is really just a long step in an evolutionary process of organisms (as well as their networks and individual parts) getting better at processing information.&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-01/&gt;

Through this lens, and an overview of human and global history, Wright typifies the argument against the views of noted paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]].  Gould wrote that "Humans are here by the luck of the draw."  Wright acknowledges one aspect of Gould's argument‚Äîthat the evolutionary process was not such that it would inevitably create humans as we know them today ("five fingers, five toes, and so on") but that evolution would almost certainly result in the creation of highly intelligent, communicating organisms, who would in turn develop tools and advanced technologies.

Evidence for natural selection driving improvements in information processing is given throughout, including the case of the [[bombardier beetle]], an insect that developed the ability to spray its attackers with harsh chemicals.  This, in turn, favored predators via natural selection who had techniques to avoid the spray.  As Wright puts it, "complexity breeds complexity."  This is the often referred to evolutionary phenomenon of the "[[Evolutionary_arms_race|arms race]]," wherein competing organisms stack up their developments in competition with one another.

Via this increasing complexity, according to ''Nonzero'', higher intelligence was thus destined to happen, perhaps even "inevitable" (see discussion of inevitability below).  Though the stated thesis is that evolution is headed in the direction of "non-zero-sumness," Wright argues that the realization of such prospects is dependent upon improvements in information processing, thus neatly carving out a reason for the creation and cultural evolution of the human species.

== Complexity and zero-sum solutions in human society ==
Wright argues that as complexity in human society increases, the ability to reap "non-zero-sum gains" increases.  For example, electronic communications enable trade at a global level, and allow various societies to trade in items they could not produce or obtain otherwise, resulting in benefits for everyone: new goods.  Similarly, global governments allow global solutions to common problems.  Were aliens to attack, or the Arctic glaciers to melt, the world would be able to use its communicative technologies to band societies together and defend itself at large.  In fact, this view of the world as an organic entity itself is touched upon in the penultimate chapter of the book, and is similar to that of [[Gaia theory]].

Of course, when societies band together to fight a common enemy, that enemy is not always an Arctic glacier, but rather, other human societies.  Wright discusses this as well, arguing that war between nations often resulted in technological and cultural evolution.  For example, [[World War II]] spurred the development of the [[Manhattan Project]] and, in turn, [[nuclear power]] and related research‚Äîa technology that may ultimately benefit the world at large.  Further, societies with advanced governments were more likely to succeed in war, spreading government systems as a technology in and of itself.

== Structure ==
The book is composed in three sections, each one more or less independent, but contributing to the development of his overall thesis.

=== Part I: A brief history of Humankind ===
This section is a sound summary of human cultural development, fairly conventional, except for his references to game theory and the occasional interjection of metaphysical speculation.

=== Part II: A brief history of Organic Life ===
This section is again a broadly conventional overview of current understanding of the development of life on earth. He argues from game-theory that increasing complexity is inevitably going to result from the operation of evolution by natural selection.  More controversially, he argues that intelligence, social co-operation and cultural development are also bound to emerge sooner or later.

=== Part III: From Here to Eternity ===
This brief section is the most controversial part of the book, which he admits is speculative and presents with a degree of humility.  The main thrust of his argument is that we may be on the threshold of a new phase of development involving the creation of a unified global consciousness, along the lines suggested in the writings of Jesuit [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

== Corollaries and criticism ==
Even the development of weapons systems themselves (and Wright's discussion of their increasing complexity over time) left him open to criticism, put into words by [[Steven Pinker]], a linguist/cognitive scientist specializing in [[evolutionary psychology]]:

:"Natural selection has the "goal" of enhancing replication, period. An increase in complexity and cooperation is just one of many subgoals that help organisms attain that ultimate goal. Other subgoals include increases in size, speed, [[motor coordination]], weaponry, energy efficiency, perceptual acuity, parental care, and so on. All have increased over evolutionary time, but none is the "natural end" of the evolutionary process. Would anyone single out lethal weaponry as "highly likely" or our "destiny," just because weapons have become more lethal over organic and human history?"  -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

Similarly, the idea of greater and greater non-zero-sum gains benefitting the world at large is also debated, as such technologies allow the injury of ever larger numbers of people.  While Wright believes that the goal of natural selection is increasing non-zero-sum gains, it is also clear that these gains might not benefit everyone.  Though this does not in any way invalidate Wright's thesis, it does dampen the optimism Wright appears to hold for non-zero-sum dynamics.  Indeed, in a world of separated, village-like units, atrocities within [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union or [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]] could not have occurred.  (Of course, life within those village-like units had its own inherent problems, and the question of which point in history was better is addressed by arguments within [[teleology]]‚Äîwhether history has a direction, and thus if history has shown consistent progress.)  Wright believes that overall there has been net progress (with some exceptions), and further, that this progress will continue.  In response to Wright's assumption that cooperation and communication will continue to increase, Pinker writes:

:"...global cooperation and moral progress will not increase toward some theoretical maximum or Teilhardesque [[Omega Point]], but will level off at a point where the pleasures resulting from global cooperation (having more stuff than you had before) are balanced by the pleasures resulting from non-cooperation (having more stuff than your neighbors, or the warm glow of ethnic chauvinism)." -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

Pinker also challenges Wright's core thesis, echoing the case made by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], that human-like organisms are no more than a coincidence:

:"A species with humanlike intelligence was no more "in the cards" than a species with an elephantlike trunk--both are just handy biological gadgets. (Of course, given enough time, humanlike intelligence is near-certain to evolve; but given enough time, anything with nonzero probability is near-certain to evolve, including an elephantlike trunk.) A brain with the intelligence necessary for cooperation and specialization is metabolically expensive and biomechanically hazardous, and evolves only when the evolutionary precursor and current ecosystem make the benefits exceed the costs. Most lineages (e.g., of plants) never got smart, and all lineages of animals on earth except ours were stuck well beneath the subgenius level." -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

== Wright's response to criticism ==
Wright acknowledges several of these criticisms within ''Nonzero'' itself and in turn responds with his purpose in writing the book‚Äîthat by acknowledging options to reap non-zero-sum gains, societies might work to decrease zero-sum losses, like the loss of resources used in the pursuit of armed conflict.

In response to Pinker's comments regarding the inevitability of human-like intelligence (as versus to the elephant trunk), Wright replies:

{{quote|A human level of intelligence--unlike an elephant's trunk--is a key step in [the march of evolution], for it gives rise to a rapid and powerful kind of cultural evolution, an evolution that increasingly, in a sense, takes on a life of its own, and has gotten us from the stone age to now... The modern world, it seems to me, features a second kind of validation of my emphasis on the biological evolution of intelligence, and my insistence that biological and cultural evolution have important parallels. A number of observers have noted that the Internet (defined broadly, to include the people who communicate over it) strikingly resembles a giant global brain. No one has claimed that it resembles a giant elephant's trunk.|[[Robert Wright (journalist)]]|[http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com]}}

There is also question of whether non-zero-sum gains will&amp;mdash;or even should&amp;mdash;benefit all members of society under any system of [[egalitarianism]].  Wright does argue that increased levels of communication will inevitably lead to a decrease in enmity between some populations.  Still, this does not answer the question of whether some members of society will ever "catch-up" in terms of technological connectedness, or if some might be barred entirely by some kind of oppressive (but still productive) political system.  Wright states on p.&amp;nbsp;329 of ''Nonzero'' (Vintage Paperback edition) that "one can well imagine, as the Internet nurtures more and more communities of interest, true friendships more and more crossing the most dangerous fault lines&amp;mdash;boundaries of religion, of nationality, of ethnicity, of culture."  Wright then states in his endnote to the section, "a big question is whether boundaries of social class will be so easily crossed &amp;mdash; or whether, on the other hand, differences of social class within a society might sharpen as people invest more of their energy in virtual communities consisting of like-minded people."

Though Wright clearly does not posit an answer to the question of struggles among economic classes&amp;mdash;whether they be because of or in spite of natural selection&amp;mdash;some argue it is relevant to Wright's treatment of evolution as resulting in greater and greater moral progress, and thus strangely ignored, given that Wright is the author of another book examining human morality ''[[The Moral Animal]]''.

== Wright and creationists ==
Wright argues for the possibility of divine purpose (and thus for the concept of [[God]] as a creating entity) but is against [[creationism]], and theories on [[intelligent design]]. He argued against the concepts in articles related to ''Nonzero''.

Like most biologists, Wright firmly rejects the notion of divine biological manipulation.  But Wright does leave open the possibility of divine intervention in the case of human consciousness, which he does not see as being easily explained by natural selection. [[Consciousness]]&amp;mdash;humans' ability to ponder their own existence&amp;mdash;seems a strange outgrowth of the evolutionary process for Wright. He describes the alternative as humans that are devoid of consciousness and behave like [[Philosophical zombie|zombies]] that form romantic relationships, eat, sleep, and have discussions only because they are programmed to via cultural and genetic transmission.

Wright argues that consciousness is still a mystery in terms of evolutionary purpose, and leaves open the possibility that a divine entity introduced the phenomenon of consciousness. Wright also debates whether or not entities aside from humans possess consciousness. Wright does not explain how a biological entity could evolve a level of intelligence like that existing in humans without the intelligence inherently including consciousness.&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-02/&gt;

Wright also briefly questions the possibilities regarding what created natural selection, but Wright himself refers to his comments as highly speculative.

Wright's idea of ''[[divinity]]'' is further explored in his follow-up book, ''The Evolution of God''.  He does not argue that an intelligent being is behind it all, but that the existence of a process that could be called ''divine'' is suggested, much the way the existence of electrons is suggested by the inner workings of a computer (despite no one ever seeing one).

[[File:TamaRe.jpg|thumb|300px|The "[[Tama-Re]]" compound as it stood in 2002]]

The '''Nuwaubian Nation''' or '''Nuwaubian movement''' ({{IPAc-en|n|uÀê|Àà|w|…îÀê|b|iÀê|…ôn}}) was an American [[Cult|religious cult]] founded and led by [[Dwight York]]. York began founding [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslim groups]] in New York in 1967. He changed his teachings and the names of his groups many times, incorporating concepts from Judaism, Christianity, and many esoteric beliefs.

In the late 1980s, he abandoned the Muslim theology of his movement in favor of [[Kemetism]] and [[UFO religion]]. In 1991 he took his community to settle in upstate New York; then they moved near to [[Eatonton, Georgia|Eatonton]], the county seat of [[Putnam County, Georgia|Putnam County]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. His followers built an [[Ancient Egyptian race controversy#Afrocentrism|ancient Egypt-themed]] compound called [[Tama-Re]] and changed their name to the "United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors."&lt;ref&gt;"Nuwaubians Arrested in Common-Law Scam" [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=143 Southern Poverty Law Center] (Winter 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, the "United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors" had some 500 adherents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adherents.com]] reports an estimated 550 adherents as of 1999 [http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_650.html], citing Copeland, Larry (''USA Today''). "Race, Religion, Rhetoric Simmer in Georgia Town", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]],'' 18 September  1999.&lt;/ref&gt; They drew thousands of visitors for "Savior's Day" (York's birthday). Adherence declined steeply after York was convicted of numerous counts of child molestation and financing violations, and sentenced to 135 years in federal prison in April 2004. The Tama-Re compound was sold under government forfeiture and demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965708086|title=The Nuwaubian Nation : black spirituality and state control|last=Palmer|first=Susan|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781351884716|location=England|pages=156|oclc=965708086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] described York as a "black supremacist cult leader",&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Bob. "[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/united-nuwaubian-nation-moors-meets-its-match-georgia United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors Meets Its Match in Georgia]". [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] ''Intelligence Report''. Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and has designated the organization as a "hate group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nuwaubian-nation-moors|title=Nuwaubian Nation of Moors|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has taken numerous names, including Ansaru Allah Community, Holy Tabernacle Ministries, United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors (after the move to Georgia), Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation (also used in Georgia when York claimed indigenous ancestry via Egyptian migration and intermarriage with the ancient [[Olmec]]) and Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.

== Founder ==
{{Main|Dwight York}}
The Nuwaubian Nation was centered exclusively on the person of its founder, Malachi (Dwight) York, who legally changed his name several times, and has used dozens of aliases.

York was born on June 26, 1935 (also reported as 1945).&lt;ref name="moser"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002063127/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=88 Moser, Bob. "Savior in a Strange Land: A black supremacist cult leader meets his match in rural Georgia," ''Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report'' 107 (Fall, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philips1"&gt;Philips, Abu Ameenah Bilal. ''The Ansar Cult in America,'' Tawheed Publications, 1988, p. 1 . Philips shows that in 1975, York's publications changed his declared birth year from 1935 to 1945, to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Muhammad Ahmad|The Mahdi]], who is popularly believed to have been born in 1845. See also [http://www.nuwaubian-hotep.net/images/york_birthcertificate.jpg York's birth certificate] as shown on then uwaubian-hotep.net website.&lt;/ref&gt; He began his ministry in the late 1960s, from 1967 preaching to a group he called the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] "Nubians" (viz. African Americans) in [[Brooklyn]].

York founded numerous esoteric or quasi-religious fraternal orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s, at first along pseudo-[[Islam]]ic lines, later moving to a loose Afrocentric ancient Egypt theme, eclectically mixing ideas taken from [[Black nationalism]], [[cryptozoology]] and UFO religions and popular [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].
During the 1980s, he was also active as a musician, as "Dr. York" publishing under the "Passion Records" label.

York published some 450 booklets (dubbed "scrolls") under numerous pseudonyms. During the late 1990s, he styled himself a messianic founder-prophet of his movement, sometimes claiming divine status or extraterrestrial origin, appearing on his Savior's Day celebrations at Tama-Re.

York was arrested in May 2002, and in 2003 he pleaded guilty to [[child sexual abuse]] after being indicted on 197 counts of child molestation, including charges of [[sex trafficking]] of minors across state lines. He was imprisoned.&lt;ref name="SPLC109" /&gt;  In 2004, he was convicted to a 135-year sentence for transporting minors across state lines in the course of sexually molesting them, racketeering, and financial reporting charges. His convictions were upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Dwight D. York, a.k.a. Malakai Z. York, etc.'' 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C. Docket No. 02-00027-CR-CAR-5-1, October 27, 2005 {{cite web |url=http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200412354.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103105819/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200412354.pdf |archivedate=November 3, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents. The case was described in the book ''Ungodly: A True Story of Unprecedented Evil'' (2007) by Bill Osinski, a reporter who had covered the Nuwaubians in Georgia during the late 1990s.

Some factions of the [[Black supremacism in the United States|Black supremacist subculture in the United States]] appeared to continue to support York as of 2010, portraying his conviction as a conspiracy by the "White Power Structure". [[Malik Zulu Shabazz]], chairman of the [[New Black Panther Party]] and York's lawyer, described York as "a great leader of our people [‚Ä¶ and] victim of an open conspiracy by our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During the 1970s, the group set up bookstores and chapters in Trinidad; [[Baltimore]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]]. According to former follower Saadik Redd, York had between 2,000 and 3,000 followers during the 1970s. Its headquarters was in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]], until 1983. A portion of the community moved to [[Sullivan County, New York]], to a site they called Camp Jazzir Abba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peecher|first1=Rob|title=York's accusers describe years of sexual abuse: Nuwaubian leader promised 'ritual' would ensure eternal life, teen says|url=http://nuwaubianfacts.com/articles/09-01-02%20B.htm|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Macon Telegraph|date=1 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=wZuoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT103&amp;lpg=PT103&amp;dq=Camp+Jazzir+Abba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vmZldQuV77&amp;sig=VAnBvtZQJqSiUmY_OluVi1VImKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixnPfb39nRAhWqv1QKHYKODmYQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Camp%20Jazzir%20Abba&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; More people stayed in Brooklyn until about 1991.

A Muslim cleric, [[Bilal Philips]], published ''The Ansar Cult in America'' in 1988, denouncing the movement as un-Islamic. Phillips relied heavily on testimonies of former adherents in describing the group's beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2010), pp. xv‚Äìxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, York borrowed from numerous religious and esoteric traditions beyond Islam, creating the "Nuwaubian" movement. York styled his movement in a mixture of Ancient Egypt and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] themes. York changed his legal name again, from "Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi" to "Malachi York," effective March 12, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;According to a scan of a court document presented at [http://www.nuwaubianfacts.com/legalnamechange.htm nuwaubianfacts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former follower Robert J. Rohan had a critical view of York's changes, as noted in this interview:

{{quote|"Malachi York came up with the idea to move down South ... because he was under FBI investigation," Rohan said. "He provided us as his followers the bogus rationale that we were moving down South to meet our spiritual parents. (He) always was quick to forget that he gave more than one reason for many changes that he introduced throughout the organization."

After moving to Georgia, York and his followers claimed affiliation with Masons and with the Jewish, Christian and Egyptian faiths.
"Once he started changing religious ideas, the older followers became skeptical and left the group," Rohan said. "That was what happened to me."&lt;ref name="crawford"&gt;[http://www.newagefraud.org/smf/index.php?topic=433.0 Sharon E. Crawford, "Former Nuwaubian writes book, tells how York duped followers," ''The Macon Telegraph,'' 14 March 2005], posted at New Age Fraud website; accessed 26 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among its themes, the Nuwaubians borrowed a claim to indigenous ancestry, perhaps from the [[Washitaw Nation]] (a Louisiana Black separatist group led by an eccentric 'empress'). They claimed to be indigenous people, named [[Yamasee]] (claiming affiliation with the confederation of Muscogee (Creek) Native American nations in the Georgia area) as well as "Moors." They claimed a [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories|prehistoric migration to America]] "before the continents drifted apart". At this point, the group called itself "Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew I. Pinzur, [http://www.culteducation.com/reference/nuwaubians/nuwaubians11.html "Nuwaubians, Who Are These People?"], ''The Macon Telegraph,'' May 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 2000s, York presided at Tama-Re styled as "Our Own Pharoah NETER A'aferti Atum-Re", leader and chief mystagogue of "The Ancient Egiptian Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gallagher|first=Eugene V.|authorlink=Eugene V.

== Reception ==

=== Political influence in Georgia ===
Initially the Nuwaubians were considered eccentric but tolerable. But tensions increased locally when they distributed leaflets attacking whites and claiming racial persecution in a zoning conflict. They had set up a nightclub in a warehouse on their property. They alienated many residents of the area, both black and white.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;

Tensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.&lt;ref name="moser2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050301090734/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=41&amp;printable=1 Moser, Bob. "'Savior' in a Strange Land: A black supremacist cult leader meets his match in rural Georgia"], ''Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report'' 107 (Fall, 2002), as archived by the Internet Archive March 2005; {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6eMwiPZsW?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050301090734/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid%3D41%26printable%3D1 |date=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the [[NAACP]] chapter. But outside, they appealed to national activists, claiming to be racially persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores "in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad," and continued to gain revenues from them.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt; York purchased a $557,000 mansion for his own use in [[Athens, Georgia]], about 60 miles away, where the University of Georgia is located.&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;

In 2001, the group put up their own candidates, associated with the Republican Party, for public office, including sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan. "Cult Fighting in Middle Georgia," ''Religion in the News''. Summer 2006, Vol. 9, No. 1. Quote: "In 2001, the Nuwaubians put up their own (Republican) candidates for public office [in Putnam County, Georgia] ‚Äì including sheriff. Prior to the primary, the county Board of Registrars declared 196 Nuwaubians ineligible to vote because they had not established residence in the county."&lt;/ref&gt; Their candidates were defeated.

In conjunction with a Nuwaubian Nation parade held in [[Augusta, Georgia]] in February 2001, the office of Augusta mayor [[Bob Young (mayor)|Bob Young]] (1999‚Äì2005) published a proclamation written by the Nuwaubian organization, stating the group's beliefs. Quotes include "the Nuwbuns were the dark, brown-to-black-skin, wooly-hair original Eygyptians." "[T]he Black race's greatness has been accepted in America and many books as people of Timbuktu Africa or the Olmecians from Uganda, Africa, who migrated and walked here to North and South America to set up colonies way before the continental drift."&lt;ref name="augusta"/&gt;

In an interview with a reporter from ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]],'' Mayor Young said that he had not personally read the statement prior to its release. He explained that his office customarily releases proclamations drafted and submitted for publication by civic groups without subjecting them to substantial content review.&lt;ref name="augusta"/&gt; He suggested that such proclamations do not constitute official positions of the mayor's office or statements of the mayor's views.&lt;ref name="augusta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eckenrode|first1=Vicky|title=Mystery circles Georgia's clan of Nuwaubians|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2001/02/25/met_308857.shtml|work=The Augusta Chronicle|date=February 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2002, Tama-Re was raided by a joint force of FBI and ATF agents, state police, and local law enforcement. Although there were fears that the raid would end in violence, no shots were fired during the operation, although tear gas was used by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team. 

York, along with his wife, was arrested outside of the property the same day on federal charges of child molestation and racketeeering, including transport of minors for sexual use. He was convicted in 2004 by a jury in federal court and sentenced to 135 years in federal prison. His appeal failed, and the US Supreme Court declined to hear the last appeal. Tama-Re was sold in asset forfeiture under the verdict, and the new owners demolished the structures. With the revelations of York's conduct, many followers abandoned the group, although some factions of the Nuwaubian Nation still exist.
 
York is currently incarcerated in [[ADX Florence]], a maximum-security federal prison in [[Florence, Colorado]]. He will be eligible for parole in 2122.

In 2004, seven officers of the [[Macon, Georgia]] police department resigned from their jobs in protest against the prosecution of York. Five of those officers were later hired by the [[Clarke County, Georgia]] jail as guards. Four of them were fired in 2006 (the fifth resigned) in the wake of charges that they were smuggling Nuwaubianist literature into the jail, corresponding with the prisoner York, encouraging inmates to rebel against white guards, and showing favoritism to Nuwaubian prisoners. The jail commander was fired after he began an investigation of Nuwaubianist influence at the jail. He has said he believes that he was fired because he undertook this investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=4 deputies fired after jail probe|url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/112306/news_20061123088.shtml|work=Athens Banner-Herald|date=November 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Joe|title=Fired jailer sues sheriff: Probe of cult influence at issue|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/18535/nuwaubians-8|work=Athens Banner-Herald|date=June 22, 2007|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence upon hip-hop ===
As "Dr. York," the movement leader was active as a vocalist and music producer in Brooklyn before leaving the area. During this time, his Nuwaubian teachings had an effect upon [[hip hop]] and Black culture in New York. Journalist Adam Heimlich of the ''New York Press'' suggested the following were influenced by York: [[Jaz-O]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Kelvin Mercer]] (Posdnuos) from [[De La Soul]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] from [[Mobb Deep]], and [[MF Doom]].&lt;ref name="nypress.com"/&gt;

In his article on York's cult, Heimlich reviewed some of the leader's published works. He wrote that York had borrowed from a variety of sources for his ideas:

{{quote|A partial list, from my notes, of places I'd encountered Nuwaubian notions before includes ''[[Chariots of the Gods?|Chariots of the Gods]]'' and the [[Ra√´l|Rael]]'s embellishments on that book, conspiracy lit, UFO lit, the [[Human Potential Movement|human potential movement]], [[Buddhism]] and [[New Age|new-age]], [[astrology]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]], [[Leonard Jeffries]] and other [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentrics]], [[Edgar Cayce|Cayce]], [[Lyndon LaRouche|LaRouche]], [[alternative medicine]], [[self-help]] lit, [[Satanism]], the [[Atkins diet]], [[numerology]] and [[yoga]]. Many of these York mentions by name. There are also extensive discourses on the [[Torah]], [[Gospel]]s and [[Quran|Koran]], as well as on [[Rastafari]]anism, the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[Five-Percent Nation]].&lt;ref name="nypress.com"&gt;Heimlich, Adam. "Black Egypt: A Visit to Tama-Re," ''New York Press'', 8 November 2000 {{cite web |url=http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109152729/http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036 |archivedate=November 9, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the [[Independent music|indie]] hip hop ranks, there are Nuwaubians who perform what they call Nu-wop, such as [[Daddi Kuwsh]], [[Twinity]], [[Nefu Amun Hotep]], [[9thScientist]], [[Scienz of Life]], [[Ntelek]], [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], Aslaam Mahdi, 720 Pure Sufi, Tos El Bashir and [[The Lost Children of Babylon]].&lt;ref name="imarisha"/&gt; On Where Light's "Swords of Malachai", Rasul lets loose: 'When my tongue swings in the form of a double-edged sword, it brings forth Nuwaubu, which is right Knowledge, wisdom and understanding.'"&lt;ref name="imarisha"&gt;[http://www.citypaper.net/articles/020801/mus.lost.shtml [[Walidah Imarisha|Imarisha, Walidah]].

In an article for ''Honor Nation,'' [[A. L. JakeAl Reum]] speculated that the controversial [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[kitsch]] costumes and props from [[OutKast]]'s [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] performance in 2004 were inspired by the Nuwaubian belief about the Native Americans being "Moors" in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Reum, A.L. JakeAl. "American Indian Identity: Tea Parties and Outkast," ''Honor Nation'', 2004 {{cite web |url=http://www.honornation.org/TeaParty.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306222416/http://www.honornation.org/TeaParty.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] described the Nuwaubianism belief system as "mix[ing] black supremacist ideas with worship of the Egyptians and their pyramids, a belief in UFOs and various conspiracies related to the Illuminati and the Bilderbergers" and quoted York's letter dated Nov. 10, 2004 as: "The Caucasian has not been chosen to lead the world. They lack true emotions in their creation. We never intended them to be peaceful. They were bred to be killers, with low reproduction levels and a short life span."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nuwaubian-nation-moors Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]" [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation has Caucasians descend from Cain: "Adam and Eve were sent to the [[Aegean Islands]] between Asia and Europe, where they started having children, and each couple's first born child was an Albino and those Albinos are called [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] in the Bible, and Cain is short for Caucasian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Palmer|first=Susan J.|authorlink=Susan J.

In 1994 Ghazi Y. Khankan, director of the New York office of the [[Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations]], commented about York and his group based on their history in Brooklyn. He said, "It's a cult, in my opinion, and in Islam there are no cults. They consider their leader a prophet, which means they have deviated from the Islamic way."&lt;ref name="nyt.ghazi"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/muslims-leave-bushwick-the-neighbors-ask-why.html DENNIS HEVESI, "Muslims Leave Bushwick; The Neighbors Ask Why"], ''New York Times,'' 24 April 1994, accessed 26 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The superficial similarity of York's beliefs to those of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]] led to some worried newspaper articles after that group's [[mass suicide]] during the appearance of [[Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp]] in 1997, in which the cult was reported to have said that a spacecraft was following the comet.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Lasseter, Tom. "Tensions Simmer Around a Black Sect in Georgia," ''New York Times'' June 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudo-language ==
[[File:nuwaubic.png|frame|right|One simple form of Nuwaubic is a simple [[substitution cipher]]]]

York taught a number of "revealing" [[False etymology|pseudo-etymologies]] of English words, for instance:

; Caucasian: from "Carcass-Asian" meaning "Degenerated Asian"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The evolutionary emergence of language in the [[human|human species]] has been a subject of speculation for several centuries. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of direct evidence. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of language must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the [[human evolution|fossil record]], archaeological evidence, contemporary language diversity, studies of [[language acquisition]], and comparisons between human [[language]] and systems of communication existing [[Animal communication|among animals]] (particularly [[Great ape language|other primates]]). Many argue that the origins of language probably relate closely to the origins of [[behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]], but there is little agreement about the implications and directionality of this connection.

This shortage of [[empirical evidence]] has led many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the western world until late in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. Inquiries into the origins of language. New York: [[Harper and Row]], p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are various hypotheses about how, why, when, and where language might have emerged.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie | last2 = Gibson | first2 = Kathleen Rita. | title = The Oxford handbook of language evolution | year = 2012 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford  ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954111-9 | oclc = 724665645 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, there is scarcely more agreement today than a hundred years ago, when [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]] provoked a rash of armchair speculation on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;M√ºller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), The Origin of Language. Bristol: [[Thoemmes Press]], pp. 7‚Äì41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1990s, however, a number of [[linguist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have attempted to address with new methods what some consider one of the hardest problems in science.&lt;!--Unbalanced opinion to call it the hardest problem in science.

==Approaches==
One can sub-divide approaches to the origin of language according to some underlying assumptions:&lt;ref name="Ulb√¶k 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ulb√¶k | first1 = Ib | title = The origin of language and cognition|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | pages = 30‚Äì43 | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Continuity theories" built on the idea that language exhibits so much complexity that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form; therefore it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our primate ancestors. 
* "Discontinuity theories" take the opposite approach‚Äîthat language, as a unique trait which cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans, must have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of [[human evolution]]. 
* Some theories see language mostly as an [[innate]] faculty‚Äîlargely genetically encoded.
* Other theories regard language as a mainly [[cultural]] system‚Äîlearned through social interaction.

[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single chance mutation occurred in one individual in the order of 100,000 years ago, installing the language faculty (a component of the mid-brain) in "perfect" or "near-perfect" form.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1996. ''Powers and Prospects. Reflections on human nature and the social order.'' London: Pluto Press, p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A majority of linguistic scholars {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} hold continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they envision language development. Among those who see language as mostly innate, some‚Äînotably [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref name="Pinker 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = S. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Natural language and natural selection | url = http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 707‚Äì784 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00081061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051123085422/http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | archivedate = 2005-11-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîavoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved in the usual gradual way.&lt;ref name="Pinker 1994"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Others in this intellectual camp‚Äînotably Ib Ulb√¶k&lt;ref name="Ulb√¶k 1998"/&gt;‚Äîhold that language evolved not from primate communication but from primate cognition, which is significantly more complex.

The time range for the evolution of language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of ''[[Homo]]'' (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full [[behavioral modernity]] some 50,000‚Äì150,000 years ago. Few dispute that ''[[Australopithecus]]'' probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of [[great ape]]s in general,&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = AC. | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 205‚Äì23 |date=Aug 2000 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.2000.0415 | pmid = 10968929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (''[[proto-language]]'') as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', while others place the development of [[symbolic communication]] only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with ''[[Homo sapiens]],'' currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, [[Johanna Nichols]]‚Äîa linguist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]‚Äîargued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998.

Atkinson&lt;ref name="Atkinson 2011"/&gt; suggests that successive population bottlenecks occurred as our African ancestors migrated to other areas, leading to a decrease in genetic and phenotypic diversity. Atkinson argues that these bottlenecks also affected culture and language, suggesting that the further away a particular language is from Africa, the fewer [[phonemes]] it contains. By way of evidence, Atkinson claims that today's African languages tend to have relatively large numbers of phonemes, whereas languages from areas in [[Oceania]] (the last place to which humans migrated), have relatively few.  Relying heavily on Atkinson's work, a subsequent study has explored the rate at which phonemes develop naturally, comparing this rate to some of Africa's oldest languages. The results suggest that language first evolved around 50,000‚Äì150,000 years ago, which is around the time when modern ''Homo sapiens'' evolved.&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135 | pmc = 3338724| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological and much other evidence indicates that language probably emerged somewhere in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] during the [[Middle Stone Age]], roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Botha 2009"&gt;

==Language origin hypotheses==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries.|Charles Darwin, 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1861, historical linguist [[Max M√ºller]] published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;M√ºller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7‚Äì41.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''bow-wow'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which M√ºller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''pooh-pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise, etc.
* '''Ding-dong'''. M√ºller suggested what he called the ''ding-dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory claims language emerged from collective rhythmic labor, the attempt to synchronize muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho.''
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max M√ºller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget.&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong‚Äîthey occasionally offer peripheral insights‚Äîas na√Øve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964.

New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols‚Äîarbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings‚Äîare unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 340 | issue = 1292 | pages = 227‚Äì230 |date=May 1993 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 | pmid = 8101657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="Smith 1994"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Smith| first1=J.Maynard|title=Must reliable signals always be costly?|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=47|issue=5|year=1994|pages=1115‚Äì1120|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, M√ºller or the other early evolutionary theorists.

Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. We trust the signal, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason‚Äîbecause they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primate social intelligence is "[[Machiavellian]]"‚Äîself-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to [[deception|deceive]] each other, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref name="Byrne 1988"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Byrne | first1 = Richard W. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew. | title = Machiavellian intelligence : social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans | year = 1988 | publisher = Clarendon Press  | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-852175-4 | oclc = 17260831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "de Waal (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1360010306 | last1 = de Waal | first1 = Frans B.

Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favor of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111‚Äì129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "[[displacement (linguistics)|displaced reference]]", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

====The 'mother tongues' hypothesis====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| chapter = Kin selection and "mother tongues": a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | title = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275‚Äì296 |url= http://homepage.univie.ac.at/tecumseh.fitch/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FitchKin2004_large.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of '[[kin selection]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1‚Äì52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 | pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîthe convergence of genetic interests between relatives‚Äîmight be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally 'mother tongues'. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals‚Äîwords‚Äîto become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie| title = Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage? | editors =  Rudolf P Botha, Martin Everaert| work = The evolutionary emergence of language : evidence and inference | year = 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 978-0-19-965485-7 | oclc = 856795812| pages = 77‚Äì96  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other primate mothers also share genes with their progeny, as do all other animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with more distant relatives. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited 'mother tongue' networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"/&gt;  Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal [[encephalization|growth of the human brain]] give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"/&gt;

====The 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' hypothesis====
Ib Ulb√¶k&lt;ref name="Ulb√¶k 1998"/&gt; invokes another standard Darwinian principle‚Äî'[[reciprocal altruism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35‚Äì57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîto explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you''. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulb√¶k points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulb√¶k concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' could possibly have been enforced.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to [[Signalling theory|advertise to the world]] their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen.&lt;ref name="Dessalles 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Dessalles| first1 =  Jean L. |title = Altruism, status and the origin of relevance|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 130‚Äì147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The gossip and grooming hypothesis====

Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]] in his book ''[[Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language]]'', does for group-living humans what [[social grooming|manual grooming]] does for other primates‚Äîit allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this problem, humans developed 'a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming'‚Äî''vocal grooming''. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to 'groom' them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language‚Äîinitially in the form of 'gossip'.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"/&gt; Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the structure of language shows adaptations to the function of narration in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus|year=2014|contribution=Language evolved for storytelling in a super-fast evolution|editor=R.

Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of 'vocal grooming'‚Äîthe fact that words are so cheap‚Äîwould have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Power, C.|year=1998|contribution=Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editor=J.

====Ritual/speech coevolution====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport 1999"/&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Jerome| title = As Well as Words: Congo Pygmy Hunting, Mimicry, and Play,| editors = Rudolf P Botha; Chris Knight| work = The cradle of language | year = 2009 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5| oclc = 804498749| pages = 236‚Äì256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a 'theory of the origins of language'. This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider‚Äînamely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Knight 2010"/&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognized within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society‚Äîone where electronic communications technology and digital computers have already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for a nonhuman ape communicating with others in the wild. Not even the cleverest nonhuman ape could make language work under such conditions.

As digital hallucinations{{Clarification needed|date=May 2018}}, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction‚Äîthose they actually use‚Äîare unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Language consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world ‚Äî they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"/&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society‚Äînamely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called 'institutional facts') can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J.

Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205‚Äì239.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.

Critics of the theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the 'non-existence' hypothesis‚Äîa denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 |title=Language and Other Cognitive Systems.

===Tool culture resilience and grammar in early Homo===

While it is possible to imitate the making of tools like those made by early Homo under circumstances of demonstration, research on primate tool cultures show that non-verbal cultures are vulnerable to environmental change. In particular, if the environment in which a skill can be used disappears for a longer period of time than an individual ape's or early human's lifespan, the skill will be lost if the culture is imitative and non-verbal. Chimpanzees, macaques and capuchin monkeys are all known to lose tool techniques under such circumstances. Researchers on primate culture vulnerability therefore argue that since early Homo species as far back as Homo habilis retained their tool cultures despite many climate change cycles at the timescales of centuries to millennia each, these species had sufficiently developed language abilities to verbally describe complete procedures, and therefore grammar and not only two-word "proto-language".&lt;ref&gt;The multiple roles of cultural transmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution, Alex Mesoudi, Andrew Whiten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution, William Clement McGrew&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that early Homo species had sufficiently developed brains for grammar is also supported by researchers who study brain development in children, noting that grammar is developed while connections across the brain are still significantly lower than adult level. These researchers argue that these lowered system requirements for grammatical language make it plausible that the genus Homo had grammar at connection levels in the brain that were significantly lower than those of Homo sapiens and that more recent steps in the evolution of the human brain were not about language.&lt;ref&gt;New Frontiers in Language Evolution and Development: Introduction to the topics Volume, D. Kimbrough Oller, Rick Dale, Ulrike Griebel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birdsong, speech, and language: exploring the evolution of mind and brain, JJ Bolhuis, M Everaert&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structuralist theory===

[[Structural linguistics]] is an approach to the study of language founded by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and popularised through his posthumously published book ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' (1916).

According to [[Structural anthropology|structural anthropologist]] [[Claude L√©vi-Strauss]], language and meaning‚Äîin opposition to "knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively"‚Äîmust have appeared in an instant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance in the ascent of animal life, language can only have arisen all at once. Things cannot have begun to signify gradually. In the wake of a transformation which is not a subject of study for the social sciences, but for biology and psychology, a shift occurred from a stage when nothing had a meaning to another stage when everything had meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=L√©vi-Strauss |first1=Claude |title=Introduction to the work of Marcel Mauss |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |isbn=0-7100-9066-8 |pages=59‚Äì60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

L√©vi-Strauss's hypothesis is a necessary consequence of Saussure's view of language as a formal system of differential elements: if a signifier only acquires meaning through its difference from other signifiers, then a hypothetical "first signifier" always already implies another signifier ("everything else" or "the rest of the universe") from which the first signifier is different. Thus, language, according to [[structuralism]], must have appeared all at once and not gradually since a semi-language is impossible.

===Chomsky's single step theory===

According to Chomsky's single mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with [[digital infinity]] as the [[seed crystal]] in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once [[Universal Darwinism|evolution]] added a single small but crucial keystone.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (2004). ''Language and Mind: Current thoughts on ancient problems.'' Part I &amp; Part II. In Lyle Jenkins (ed.), ''Variation and Universals in Biolinguistics.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 379‚Äì405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three factors in language design"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1‚Äì22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst some suggest it follows from this theory that language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution, Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C. Berwick, suggests it is completely compatible with modern biology. They note "none of the recent accounts of human language evolution seem to have completely grasped the shift from conventional Darwinism to its fully [[stochastic]] modern version‚Äîspecifically, that there are stochastic effects not only due to sampling like directionless drift, but also due to directed stochastic variation in fitness, migration, and heritability‚Äîindeed, all the "forces" that affect individual or gene frequencies. ...  All this can affect evolutionary outcomes‚Äîoutcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language's emergence."

Citing evolutionary geneticist [[Svante P√§√§bo]] they concur that a substantial difference must have occurred to differentiate ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from [[Neanderthal]]s to "prompt the relentless spread of our species who had never crossed open water up and out of Africa and then on across the entire planet in just a few tens of thousands of years. ... What we do not see is any kind of "gradualism" in new tool technologies or innovations like fire, shelters, or figurative art." Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the arrival of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa, and the last exodus from Africa, respectively). "That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000‚Äì6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred‚Äîbut neither is it on the scale of geological eons. It's time enough‚Äîwithin the ballpark for what Nilsson and Pelger (1994) estimated as the time required for the full evolution of a [[vertebrate]] eye from a single cell, even without the invocation of any 'evo-devo' effects."&lt;ref name="Berwick and Chomsky 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berwick | first = Robert | last2 = Chomsky |first2= Noam | title = Why Only Us: Language and Evolution | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780262034241 | oclc = 934433881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from [[gesture]]s that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that [[oral communication|verbal language]] and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1993"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kimura | first1 = Doreen. | title = Neuromotor mechanisms in human communication | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-505492-7 | oclc = 26396505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J. |year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76‚Äì80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arbib MA, Liebal K, Pika S |title=Primate vocalization, gesture, and the evolution of human language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1053‚Äì63; discussion 1063‚Äì76 |date=December 2008  |pmid=19391445 |doi=10.1086/593015|last2=Liebal |last3=Pika }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is also the fact that, from infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/015) |pmid=15072537 |title=Gesture Development |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=173‚Äì86 |year=2004 |last1=Capone |first1=Nina C. |last2=McGregor |first2=Karla K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oz√ßali≈ükan S, Goldin-Meadow S |title=Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development |journal=Cognition |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=B101‚Äì13 |date=July 2005  |pmid=15996556 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|last2=Goldin-Meadow }}&lt;/ref&gt; This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that we use despite being able to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it.

Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rizzolatti, G. (2008). Giacomo Rizzolatti on the Evolution of Language. Retrieved from http://gocognitive.net/interviews/evolution-language-gestures{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which supports the gestural theory:
# Language developed from the calls of our ancestors.
# Language was derived from gesture.
The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of our ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the center that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans. In monkeys, this center is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate‚Äîwithout emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, we resort to the idea that language was derived from gesture (we communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later).

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed: 
# Our ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.&lt;ref name="Corballis 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Corballis | first1 = Michael C. | editors = Alison Wray| title = The transition to language | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-925066-0 | oclc = 48532303 | pages = 161‚Äì179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact‚Äîfor example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal [[mimesis]] (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal's reliability. The suggestion is that only once community-wide contractual understandings had come into force&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6), Rome, Italy, 12‚Äì15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; could trust in communicative intentions be automatically assumed, at last allowing ''Homo sapiens'' to shift to a more efficient default format. Since vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose, it was only at this point‚Äîwhen intrinsically persuasive body-language was no longer required to convey each message‚Äîthat the decisive shift from manual gesture to our current primary reliance on ''spoken'' language occurred.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris |  title = Play as precursor of phonology and syntax| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic for | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 99‚Äì1119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A comparable hypothesis states that in 'articulate' language, gesture and vocalisation are intrinsically linked, as language evolved from equally intrinsically linked dance and song.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Humans still use manual and facial gestures when they speak, especially when people meet who have no language in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Ian Q. Whishaw  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |edition=5th |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, a great number of [[sign languages]] still in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities. These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} (Compare the [[motor theory of speech perception]].)

Critics of gestural theory note that it is difficult to name serious reasons why the initial pitch-based [[vocal]] communication (which is present in primates) would be abandoned in favor of the much less effective non-vocal, gestural communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} However, [[Michael Corballis]] has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the "gesture-first" theory have been presented by researchers in [[psycholinguistics]], including [[David McNeill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Tool-use associated sound in the evolution of language===

Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. The ''Tool-use sound hypothesis'' suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly ''incidental sound of locomotion'' (''ISOL'') and ''tool-use sound'' (''TUS'').&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Tool-use-associated sound in the evolution of language | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 993‚Äì1005 | doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0885-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ''ISOL''. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1‚Äì14 | doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z| pmc = 3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, ''TUS'', and mimicry of ''TUS'', might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing ([[motor neuron]]s, hearing, [[proprioception]], touch, vision), and ''TUS'' stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor-processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of ''TUS'' may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use.&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"/&gt; A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage. A gradual change in acoustic properties and/or meaning could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to ''TUS'' over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

===Mirror neurons and language origins===

In humans, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey [[mirror neuron]] system in the [[frontal lobe|inferior frontal cortex]], close to [[Broca's area]], one of the language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, John R.]], ''Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness'', Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by some [[Cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitectonic]] homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.&lt;ref name="Petrides 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petrides | first1 = M. | last2 = Cadoret | first2 = G. | last3 = Mackey | first3 = S. | title = Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1235‚Äì8 |date=Jun 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03628 | pmid = 15988526 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1235P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of [[vocabulary]] expansion link to the ability of [[children]] to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations.

Analysis of the data using [[Granger Causality]] revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system.&lt;ref name=Schippers&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001791107 |last=Schippers |first=MB |last2=Roebroeck |first2=A |last3=Renken |first3=R |last4=Nanetti |first4=L |last5=Keysers |first5=C |title=Mapping the Information flow from one brain to another during gestural communication |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=20 |pages=9388‚Äì93 |pmid=20439736 |pmc=2889063 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9388S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Putting the baby down theory===
According to [[Dean Falk]]'s 'putting the baby down' theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Falk | first1 = D. | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early hominins: whence motherese? | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 491‚Äì503; discussion 503‚Äì83 |date=Aug 2004 | url = http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS260/Falk2004.pdf | pmid = 15773427 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing 'motherese'‚Äîan infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"/&gt;

In ''[[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]]'', psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. "No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K.|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ.

=== From where to what theory ===
[[File:Language processing in the brain.png|thumb|Language is processed in 2 pathways in the human brain: the auditory ventral stream and auditory dorsal stream. The auditory ventral stream begins in the anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), which projects to the anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS), middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and Temporal pole (TP). These regions then project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound recognition. The auditory dorsal stream begins in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), which projects to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), Sylvian parieto-temporal junction (Spt), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These regions then also project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound localization and for the articulation of speech. Modified with permission from: Poliva, O.

[[File:From where to what.png|thumb|The 'from where to what' model of language evolution hypotheses 7 stages of language evolution: 1. The origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls between mothers and offspring used to relocate each other in cases of separation. 2. Offspring of early Homo modified the contact calls with intonations in order to emit two types of contact calls: contact calls that signal low level of distress and contact calls that signal high-level of distress. 3. The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation. In this scenario, the offspring emits a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother responds with a low-level distress call to enable the interaction or high-level distress call to prohibit it. 4. The use of intonations improved over time, and eventually, individuals acquired sufficient vocal control to invent new words to objects. 5. At first, offspring learned the calls from their parents by imitating their lip-movements. 6. As the learning of calls improved, babies learned new calls (i.e., phonemes) through lip imitation only during infancy. After that period, the memory of phonemes lasted for a lifetime, and older children became capable of learning new calls (through mimicry) without observing their parents' lip-movements. 7. Individuals became capable of rehearsing sequences of calls. This enabled the learning of words with several syllables, which increased vocabulary size. Further developments to the brain circuit responsible for rehearsing poly-syllabic words resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing lists of words (phonological working memory), which served as the platform for communication with sentences.

The ‚Äòfrom where to what‚Äô model argues that the co-localization of sound localization, audio-visual integration and discrimination of voices is evidence that speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls (stage 1 in figure). These calls are used by con-specifics in order to announce to the troop of their presence or location. In this scenario, speech could have began when a mother and offspring accidentally separated in the forest, and the two took turns emitting contact calls until they were re-united.

A possible transition from contact call to speech is that due to a mutation in the auditory dorsal stream, early hominans (i.e., Homo habilis) became capable of modifying the contact calls with intonations (stage 2 in figure). This enabled infants to emit two types of contact calls, one that signals the mother the infant is safe but desires her attention and another that signals immediate danger. Such a development would have provided the mother with an advantage as it informs her whether she needs to drop everything she carries and rush to the baby, or she can take her time. As generations passed and vocal control improved, mothers and offspring became capable of communicating with very simple yes-no question answer conversations (stage 3 in figure). In such a scenario, a baby is emitting a low-level distress call to signal desire to eat berries, and the mother responding with a low-level distress call to permit the activity or high-level distress call to prohibit it. This use of intonations in order to emit two types of calls, one for low level of distress and another for high level of distress could explain why humans today use intonations to transform words into questions or commands (for example, converting the word ‚Äòfood‚Äô into a question or command with different intonations).

In accordance with the model, as generations passed, vocal control increased from just modifying calls with intonations to emitting novel calls (stage 4 in figure). During this time, infants learned these call by imitating their parents‚Äô lip-movements (stage 5 in figure). This hypothesis explains the role of the auditory dorsal stream in many studies of lip-speech integration as occurs in lip-reading&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. A role for reading lips as a mean for the acquisition of novel calls can also explain the distinctive large human lips, which are not found with other apes. Supporting the model are studies¬†of patients with damage to the auditory dorsal stream that were reported with impaired ability to repeat sentences and nonsense words ([[conduction aphasia]])&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, or impaired ability to name objects ([[Anomic aphasia|anomia]])&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

Learning calls by offspring imitating the lip-movements of their parents eventually reached a maximum limit of efficiency. At this point, the offspring were able to learn new vocalizations soon after hearing them, and the memory lasted for their entire life (stage 6 in figure). Such a transition could explain the tendency of babies, at their first year, to mimic their parents by imitating their lip-movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tenenbaum|first=Elena J.|last2=Shah|first2=Rajesh J.|last3=Sobel|first3=David M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|last5=Morgan|first5=James L.|date=2012-06-20|title=Increased Focus on the Mouth Among Infants in the First Year of Life: A Longitudinal Eye-Tracking Study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|journal=Infancy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=534‚Äì553|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|issn=1525-0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubicek|first=Claudia|last2=de Boisferon|first2=Anne Hillairet|last3=Dupierrix|first3=Eve|last4=L≈ìvenbruck|first4=H√©l√®ne|last5=Gervain|first5=Judit|last6=Schwarzer|first6=Gudrun|date=2013-02-25|title=Face-scanning behavior to silently-talking faces in 12-month-old infants: The impact of pre-exposed auditory speech|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0165025412473016|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=106‚Äì110|doi=10.1177/0165025412473016|issn=0165-0254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewkowicz|first=David J.|date=2010|title=Infant perception of audio-visual speech synchrony.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015579|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=66‚Äì77|doi=10.1037/a0015579|issn=1939-0599}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that after the first year this mimicry process ends&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|date=November 2004|title=Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1533|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=En|volume=5|issue=11|pages=831‚Äì843|doi=10.1038/nrn1533|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The development of a memory store for vocalizations in the parietal lobe of the auditory dorsal stream could have provided the neurological infra-structure for rehearsing lists of calls, thus resulting with poly-syllabic words (stage 7 in figure). Eventually the rehearsal of lists of syllables enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which made the communication with sentences possible. 

===Grammaticalisation theory===
'[[Grammaticalization|Grammaticalisation]]' is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially 'incorrect' usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, D. and D. Wilson 1986. ''Relevance. Communication and cognition.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, we can legitimately infer similar principles at work among our distant ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | year = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, P.

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, we need to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying [[metaphor]]s rooted in shared bodily experience.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"&gt;Lakoff, G. and M. Johnson 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as 'belly' or 'back' to convey abstract meanings such as 'inside' or 'behind'. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. For example, English speakers might say 'It is going to rain,' modeled on 'I am going to London.' This can be abbreviated colloquially to 'It's gonna rain.' Even when in a hurry, we don't say 'I'm gonna London'‚Äîthe contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples we can see why grammaticalization is consistently unidirectional‚Äîfrom concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;

Grammaticalization theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;111&lt;/sup&gt; Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what would realistically have prevented people from using, say, 'spear' as if it were a verb ('Spear that pig!'). People might have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Heine

Creativity drives grammatical change.&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"/&gt; This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritize imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity‚Äîemitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example‚Äîis not the kind of behavior which, say, [[vervet monkey]]s would appreciate or reward.&lt;ref name="Cheney Seyfarth 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Dorothy L.|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M.|title=Constraints and preadaptations in the earliest stages of language evolution|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2‚Äì4| pages = 135‚Äì59|year=2005|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~seyfarth/Publications/LinguisticReview.pdf|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability.&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signals | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852684-1 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If humans escape these constraints, it is because in our case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions‚Äîinhabitants of the imagination‚Äîas potentially informative and interesting. Take the use of metaphor. A metaphor is, literally, a false statement.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, R. D. 1979. What metaphors mean. In S. Sacks (ed.), ''On Metaphor.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 29‚Äì45.&lt;/ref&gt; Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!' Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalization is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. and R. N√∫√±ez 2000. ''Where mathematics comes from.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge‚Äîexplaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as we know it. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: "Grammaticalization requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another".&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt; Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail.

=== Evolution-Progression Model ===

Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound, i.e., language. Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Gallup, GG Jr.| title = Chimpanzees: Self recognition| journal = Science

===Self-domesticated ape theory===
According to a study investigating the song differences between [[white-rumped munia]]s and its domesticated counterpart ([[society finch|Bengalese finch]]), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference‚Äî[[sexual selection]]‚Äîand remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song sintax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363‚Äì370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[bird vocalization]], brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor center, called the robust nucleus of [[arcopallium]], connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song syntax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363‚Äì370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to think about human evolution is that we are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches‚Äîmate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers‚Äîso might our cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of our primate behavioral traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop‚Äîthey basically construct themselves "bottom up", with one set of neuronal interactions setting the stage for the next round of interactions‚Äîdegraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterizes human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Graham Ritchie|author2=Simon Kirby|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2005|title=Selection, domestication, and the emergence of learned communication systems|journal=Second International Symposium on the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication|volume=|pages=|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121153322/http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech and language for communication ==
{{See also|Animal communication|Animal language|Origin of speech}}
A distinction can be drawn between [[speech]] and [[language]]. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

Some scholars view language as an initially cognitive development, its 'externalisation' to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is [[recursion]],&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hauser | first1 = MD. | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = N. | last3 = Fitch | first3 = WT. | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569‚Äì79 | date = Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars‚Äînotably [[Daniel Everett]]‚Äîdeny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. [[Pirah√£ language|Pirah√£]]) which allegedly lack this feature.&lt;ref name="Everett 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Daniel L.|title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Piraha Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=46| issue=4|year=2005| pages=621‚Äì646| doi=10.1086/431525|url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhordania | first = I. M. | title = Who asked the first question : the origins of human choral singing, intelligence, language and speech | publisher = Logos Tbilisi Ivane Javakhishvili State University | location = Tbilisi, Georgia | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789994031818 | oclc= 224993377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some captive primates (notably [[bonobos]] and [[chimpanzees]]), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. {{Citation needed|reason=The chimp Washoe, pointing first doll, and then the mouth was able to ask the simple question: Time to eat?|date=January 2014}} Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception‚Äîtonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented‚Äîuse similar rising "question intonation" for [[yes‚Äìno question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bolinger, Dwight L. (Editor) 1972. ''Intonation''. Selected Readings. Harmondsworth: Penguin, pg.314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruttenden 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cruttenden | first1 = Alan | title = Intonation | year = 1986 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-26028-2 | oclc = 12103838| pages = 169‚Äì174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of [[question intonation]]. In general, according to some authors, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==Cognitive development and language==
One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level [[reference]] (or [[deixis]]), the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:

* [[Theory of mind]]
* Capacity to acquire non-linguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* [[Numerical cognition|Number representation]]&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

===Theory of mind===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Call and Tomasello's research on [[chimpanzees]] supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Number representation===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1‚Äì9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [[A-Ha! moment|"a-ha!" moment]] and understand that the value of any integer ''n'' is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings.&lt;ref name="Carey 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Susan|title=Cognitive Foundations of Arithmetic: Evolution and Ontogenisis|journal=Mind and Language| volume=16|issue=1|year=2001| pages=37‚Äì55 |doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00155|url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/carey2001c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the "open-ended generative property" of language in human numeral cognition.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

==Linguistic structures==

===Lexical-phonological principle===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F.|title=The Origin of Speech|journal=Scientific American| volume=203| issue=3|year=1960|pages=88‚Äì96|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88|url=http://www.gifted.ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Hockett60.pdf|bibcode=1960SciAm.203c..88H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:

* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
*Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific [[phonotactic]] rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few coexist within the same species. Bird-song, singing nonhuman apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures apparently devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain other primate species do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates' systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a "boom", the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Pidgins and creoles===
{{Main|Creole language|pidgin}}
Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed [[word order]] and the words have no [[inflection]].&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Jared M. | title = The third chimpanzee : the evolution and future of the human animal |chapter = Bridges to human language | year = 1992 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-06-018307-3 | oclc = 24246928| pages = 141‚Äì167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a [[creole language]], which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not share any common language origins. In addition, creoles share similarities despite being developed in isolation from each other. [[Language bioprogram theory|Syntactic similarities]] include [[subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject]] word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt;

===Primate communication===
Field primatologists can give us useful insights into [[great ape]] communication in the wild.&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"/&gt; An important finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signalers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalizations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"/&gt; In captivity, nonhuman apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use [[lexigrams]]‚Äîsymbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words‚Äîon computer keyboards. Some nonhuman apes, such as [[Kanzi]], have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.&lt;ref name="Savage-Rumbaugh 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first1 = E. Sue | last2 = Lewin | first2 = Roger. | title = Kanzi : the ape at the brink of the human min | year = 1994 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-471-58591-6 | oclc = 30112573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage-Rumbaugh 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first1 = E.

The [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make "vocal calls", and these calls are generated by circuits in the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron., ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education, Inc. (2007), {{ISBN|0-13-227584-8}} pages 789‚Äì90&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wild, the communication of [[vervet monkey]]s has been the most extensively studied.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt; They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a "leopard call", a "snake call", and an "eagle call".&lt;ref name="Seyfarth Cheney 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyfarth|first1=Robert M.|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.| last3=Marler| first3=Peter| title=Vervet monkey alarm calls: Semantic communication in a free-ranging primate|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=28| issue=4| year=1980| pages=1070‚Äì1094 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80097-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys who hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds. Other vocalizations may be used for identification. If an infant monkey calls, its mother turns toward it, but other vervet mothers turn instead toward that infant's mother to see what she will do.&lt;ref name="Arnold Zuberb√ºhler 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnold|first1=Kate|last2=Zuberb√ºhler|first2=Klaus|title=Language evolution: Semantic combinations in primate calls| journal=Nature| volume=441|issue=7091| year=2006|pages=303‚Äì303| doi=10.1038/441303a| pmid=16710411|bibcode=2006Natur.441..303A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/science/23lang.html |title=Nigerian Monkeys Drop Hints on Language Origin |author=Wade, Nicholas |date=2006-05-23 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different "words" in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalizations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1173219994 | title=The referentiality of chimpanzee vocal signaling: behavioral and acoustic analysis of food barks |author=Gibbons, Christopher M.| year=2007 |publisher=[[Ohio State University]]| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slocombe Zuberb√ºhler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slocombe|first1=Katie E.|last2=Zuberb√ºhler|first2=Klaus|title=Functionally Referential Communication in a Chimpanzee|journal=Current Biology|volume=15| issue=19|year=2005| pages=1779‚Äì1784|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.068|pmid=16213827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ardipithecus ramidus''===

A study published in ''Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology'' in 2017 claims that ''A. ramidus'',  a hominin dated at approximately 4.5Ma, shows the first evidence of an anatomical shift in the hominin lineage suggestive of increased vocal capability.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |volume=68 |pages=101‚Äì121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study compared the skull of ''A. ramidus'' with twenty nine chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features ''A. ramidus'' clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Significantly, such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture was argued may have resulted in greater vocal capability. This assertion was based on the notion that the chimpanzee vocal tract ratios that prevent speech are a result of growth factors associated with puberty‚Äîgrowth factors absent in ''A. ramidus'' ontogeny.  ''A. ramidus'' was also found to have a degree of cervical lordosis more conducive to vocal modulation when compared with chimpanzees as well as cranial base architecture suggestive of increased vocal capability.

What was significant in this study was the observation that the changes in skull architecture that correlate with reduced aggression are the same changes necessary for the evolution of early hominin vocal ability. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity.

While the skull of ''A. ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A. ramidus''‚Äîbased on similar vocal tract ratios‚Äîmay have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

{{quote|We propose that as a result of paedomorphic morphogenesis of the cranial base and craniofacial morphology ''Ar. ramidus'' would have not been limited in terms of the mechanical components of speech production as chimpanzees and bonobos are. It is possible that ''Ar. ramidus'' had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability. In this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin. However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

===Early ''Homo''===
Regarding articulation, there is considerable speculation about the language capabilities of early ''[[Homo]]'' (2.5 to 0.8 million years ago). Anatomically, some scholars believe features of [[bipedalism]], which developed in [[australopithecine]]s around 3.5 million years ago, would have brought changes to the skull, allowing for a more L-shaped vocal tract. The shape of the tract and a larynx positioned relatively low in the neck are necessary prerequisites for many of the sounds humans make, particularly vowels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Other scholars believe that, based on the position of the larynx, not even [[Neanderthals]] had the anatomy necessary to produce the full range of sounds modern humans make.&lt;ref name="Aronoff 2001"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Aronoff | first1 = Mark. | last2 = Rees-Miller | first2 = Janie. | title = The handbook of linguistics | year = 2001 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-631-20497-8 | oclc = 43115110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258‚Äì267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier proposed that differences between ''Homo sapiens'' and Neanderthal vocal tracts could be seen in fossils, but the finding that the Neanderthal [[hyoid bone]] (see below) was identical to that found in ''Homo sapiens'' has weakened these theories.  Still another view considers the lowering of the larynx as irrelevant to the development of speech.&lt;ref name="Ohala 2000"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Ohala | first = John J. | title = The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech | url = http://confs.infres.enst.fr/evolang/actes/_actes51.html | publisher = Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications Paris ‚Äì France | year = 2000 | accessdate = 4 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic ''Homo sapiens''===
{{Further|Archaic humans}}
[[Steven Mithen]] proposed the term ''Hmmmmm'' for the pre-linguistic system of communication used by archaic ''[[Homo]].'' beginning with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' and reaching the highest sophistication in the [[Middle Pleistocene]] with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]].'' ''Hmmmmm'' is an acronym for ''h''olistic (non-compositional), ''m''anipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), ''m''ulti-''m''odal (acoustic as well as gestural and facial), [[origin of music|''m''usical]], and ''m''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Mithen | first1 = Steven J. | title = The singing neanderthals : the origins of music, language, mind, and body | year = 2006 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-02192-1 | oclc = 62090869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Homo heidelbergensis''====
{{See also|Homo_heidelbergensis#Language|l1=Homo heidelbergensis: Language}}
''Homo heidelbergensis'' was a close relative (most probably a migratory descendant) of ''[[Homo ergaster]].'' Some researchers believe this species to be the first hominin to make controlled vocalizations, possibly mimicking animal vocalizations,&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006"/&gt; and that as ''Homo heidelbergensis'' developed more sophisticated culture, proceeded from this point and possibly developed an early form of symbolic language.

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, [[Richard G. Klein]] in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. For 2 million years following the emergence of ''Homo habilis,'' the stone tool technology of hominins changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final aesthetic form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed.&lt;ref name="kleinbio"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402190101 |pmid=15079069 |pmc=395972 |title=Biography of Richard G.

Based on computer simulations used to evaluate that evolution of language that resulted in showing three stages in the evolution of syntax, Neanderthals are thought to have been in stage 2, showing they had something more evolved than proto-language but not quite as complex as the language of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0959774303000040 |title=Pleistocene Exchange Networks as Evidence for the Evolution of Language |journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal |volume=13 |pages=67‚Äì81 |year=2003 |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still much debate as to whether behavioural modernity emerged in Africa at around the same time, a growing number of archaeologists nowadays invoke the southern African Middle Stone Age use of red ochre pigments‚Äîfor example at [[Blombos Cave]]‚Äîas evidence that modern anatomy and behaviour co-evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

===The descended larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch. WT 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The phonetic potential of nonhuman vocal tracts: comparative cineradiographic observations of vocalizing animals | journal = Phonetica | volume = 57 | issue = 2‚Äì4 | pages = 205‚Äì18  | year = 2000  | doi = 10.1159/00002847 | pmid = 10992141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | last2 = Reby | first2 = D. | title = The descended larynx is not uniquely human. | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 268 | issue = 1477 | pages = 1669‚Äì75 |date=Aug 2001 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2001.1704 | pmid = 11506679 | pmc = 1088793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weissengruber | first1 = GE. | last2 = Forstenpointner | first2 = G. | last3 = Peters | first3 = G. | last4 = K√ºbber-Heiss | first4 = A. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = WT. | title = Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyxjubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus). | journal = J Anat | volume = 201 | issue = 3 | pages = 195‚Äì209 |date=Sep 2002 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x | pmid = 12363272 |pmc = 1570911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Philip|title=The Evolution of Human Speech: Its Anatomical and Neural Bases|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=48| issue=1| year=2007 |pages=39‚Äì66| url=http://www.cog.brown.edu/people/lieberman/pdfFiles/Lieberman%20P.%202007.%20The%20evolution%20of%20human%20speech,%20Its%20anatom.pdf| doi=10.1086/509092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244‚Äì54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs‚Äîincreasing the risk of choking while swallowing food‚Äîwe are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit‚Äîso it is claimed‚Äîmust have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"/&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech, thus not excluding that it was selected for e.g. improved singing ability.

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"‚Äîgiving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171‚Äì172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21‚Äì45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonemic diversity===
In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of [[phoneme]]s from 500 different languages as well as [[language families]] and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa.  The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and [[Oceanic languages|Oceania]] and South America had the smallest number.  After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations.  Atkinson's "best fit" model is that language originated in central and southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.  This predates the hypothesized [[Coastal migration|southern coastal peopling]] of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia.  It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=Quentin |title=Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa |url=http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/prelims/2011/Atkinson-346-9.pdf |work=Science Magazine |volume=332 |pages=346‚Äì349 |date=2011 |access-date=9 July 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.1199295 |pmid=21493858|bibcode=2011Sci...332..346A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In religion and mythology===
{{Main|Mythical origins of language}}
{{See also|Divine language|Adamic language}}
The search for the origin of language has a long history rooted in [[mythology]]. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a [[divine language]] predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the [[language of the birds]], are also common, and were of particular interest during the [[Renaissance]].

[[VƒÅc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As [[Brahman]]'s "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s". The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begat many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]], were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (11) says that God prevented the [[Tower of Babel]] from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages.  After this, they migrated to other regions, grouped together according to which of the newly created languages they spoke, explaining the origins of languages and nations outside of the fertile crescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert T. |last=Pennock |title=Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism |publisher=Bradford Books |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aC1OccYnX0sC&amp;dq=Tower+of+Babel:+The+Evidence+Against+the+New+Creationism|isbn=9780262661652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical experiments===
{{main|Language deprivation experiments}}
History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2.2). He relates that Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably [[Psammetichus I]], 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried "bekos" with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for "bread". From this, Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King [[James V of Scotland]] is said to have tried a similar experiment; his children were supposed to have spoken [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Both the medieval monarch [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and [[Akbar]] are said to have tried similar experiments; the children involved in these experiments did not speak. The current situation of [[deaf people]] also points into this direction.

===History of research===
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Modern linguistics does not begin until the late 18th century, and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[animism#Philosophy|animist]] theses of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to [[historical linguistics]] developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of [[Karl Brugmann]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as [[universal grammar]], [[mass comparison]] and [[glottochronology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The "origin of language" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in [[neurolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[human evolution]]. The ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' introduced "Origin of language" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of [[evolutionary linguistics]] are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''Parametric determinism''' is a [[Marxist]] interpretation of the course of history. It was formulated by [[Ernest Mandel]] and can be viewed as one variant of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]] or as a [[philosophy of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Die Dialektik von Produktivkraften, Produktionsverhaltenissen und Klassenkampf neben Kategorien der Latenz und des Parametrischen Determinismus in der Materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung". In: ''Die Versteinerten Verhaltenisse zum tanzen Bringen. Beitrage zur Marxistischen Theorie Heute''. Berlin: Dietz Verlag, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article critical of the [[analytical Marxism]] of [[Jon Elster]], Mandel explains the idea as follows:
{{Quotation|Dialectical determinism as opposed to mechanical, or formal-logical determinism, is also parametric determinism; it permits the adherent of [[historical materialism]] to understand the real place of human action in the way the historical process unfolds and the way the outcome of social crises is decided. Men and women indeed make their own history. The outcome of their actions is not mechanically predetermined. Most, if not all, historical crises have several possible outcomes, not innumerable fortuitous or arbitrary ones; that is why we use the expression 'parametric determinism' indicating several possibilities within a given set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1989/xx/nosense.htm Ernest Mandel, "How To Make No Sense of Marx" (1989) in: ''Analyzing Marxism. New essays on Analytical Marxism'', edited by Robert Ware &amp; Kai Nielsen, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 15, 1989, The University of Calgary Press, pp. 105‚Äì132.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formal rationality and dialectical reason==

In formal-logical determinism, human action is considered ''either'' rational, and hence logically explicable, ''or else'' arbitrary and random (in which case human actions can be comprehended at best only as patterns of statistical distributions, i.e. as degrees of variability relative to some constants). But in dialectical determinism, human action may be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''determinate'', hence reasonable, even although it is ''not'' explicable exclusively in terms of deductive inference. The action selected by people from a limited range of options may not be the "most logical" or "most optimal" one, but it can be shown to be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''reasonable'' under the circumstances, if the total context is considered.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs, ''Evolutionary explanation in the social sciences: an emerging paradigm.'' Totown (New Jersey): Rowman and Littlefield, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

What this means is that, in human situations, typically ''several "logics" are operating at the same time'' which together determine the outcomes of those situations:

*the logic of the actors themselves, in their consciousness and actions.
*the logic of the given parameters constraining their behaviour.
*the logic of the interactive (reflexive) relationship between actors and their situation.

If one considered only one of these aspects, one might judge people's actions "irrational", but if all three aspects are taken into account, what people do may appear "very reasonable". [[Dialectical]] theory aims to demonstrate this, by linking different "logical levels" together as a total picture, in a non-arbitrary way. "Different logical levels" means that particular determinants regarded as irrelevant at one level of analysis are excluded, but are relevant and included at another level of analysis with a somewhat different (or enlarged) set of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Partially independent variables and internal logic in classical Marxist economic analysis‚Äô", in ''Social Science Information'', vol. 24 no. 3 (1985), pp. 487‚Äì88 (reprinted in Ulf Himmelstrand, ''Interfaces in Economic &amp; Social Analysis'', London 1992).[gesd.free.fr/mandel85.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîdepending on the kind of problem being investigated.

For example, faced with a situation, the language which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well that at least some of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can  coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people do it all the time, and think it perfectly "reasonable". For another example, people will say "you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself" or "on the ground." What they mean is that the meaning of the totality of interacting factors involved can only be understood by experiencing them. Standing outside the situation, things seem irrational, but being there, they appear very reasonable.

Dialectical theory does not mean that, in analyzing the complexity of human action, inconvenient facts are simply and arbitrarily set aside. It means, rather, that those facets of the subjectmatter which are not ''logically required'' at a given stage of the analysis are set aside. Yet, and this is the point, as the analysis progresses, the previously disregarded aspects are integrated step by step into the analysis, in a consistent way. The proof of the validity of the procedure is that, at the end, the theory has made the subjectmatter fully self-explanatory, since all salient aspects have been given their appropriate place in the theory, so that all of it becomes comprehensible, without resort to shallow tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This result can obviously be achieved only after the research has already been done, and the findings can be arranged in a convincing way. A synthesis cannot be achieved without a preceding analysis. So dialectical analysis is not a "philosopher's stone" that provides a quick short-cut to the "fount of wisdom", but a mode of presenting findings of the analysis after knowledge has been obtained through inquiry and research, and dialectical relationships have been verified. Because only then does it become clear where the story should begin and end, so that all facets are truly explained. According to Ernest Mandel, "Marx's method is much richer than the procedures of ' successive concretization' or 'approximation' typical of academic science."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mainstream social theory, the problem of "several logics" in human action is dealt with by [[game theory]], a kind of modelling which specifies the choices and options which actors have within a defined setting, and what the effects are of their decisions. The main limitation of that approach is, that the model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based, while the choice of assumptions is often eclectic or fairly arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun P. Hargreaves-Heap and Yanis Varoufakis, ''Game theory. A critical introduction.'' (2nd ed.). London: Routledge, 2004. Steve Keen, "My Friend Yanis, The Greek Minister Of Finance." ''Forbes'', 31 january 2015.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/01/31/my-friend-yanis-the-greek-minister-of-finance/]&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectical theory attempts to overcome this problem, by paying attention to the sources of assumptions, and by integrating the assumptions in a consistent way.

==Making history==

One common problem in [[history|historical analysis]] is to understand to what extent the results of human actions can be attributed to free choices and decisions people made (or [[free will]]), and to what extent they are a product of social or natural forces beyond their control.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sherman, "Marx and determinism". ''Journal of Economic Issues'', Vol. 15 No. 1, 1981, pp. 61‚Äì71.&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve this problem theoretically, Mandel suggests that in almost any human situation, some factors ("[[parameter]]s") are beyond the control of individuals, while some other conditions are under their control (arguably, one group of people could "impose parameters" on another, analogous to parents imposing constraints on children). Some things can under the circumstances be changed by human action, according to [[choice]], but others cannot or will not be, and can thus be regarded as constants. A variable can vary, yet it cannot vary in any direction whatever but only within the given parameters. In a general sense, a "parameter" is a given condition imposed on a situation, or a controlled variable, but more specifically it refers to a condition which, in some way, ''limits the amount and type of variability there can be''.

Those given, objective parameters which are beyond people's control (and thus cannot normally be changed by them) ''limit'' the realm of possibilities in the future; they ''rule out'' some conceivable future developments or alternatively make them ''more likely to happen''. In that sense human action is "determined" and "determinate". If that wasn't so, then it would be impossible to predict anything much about human behaviour.

Some of these parameters refer to limits imposed by the physical world, others to limits imposed by the social set-up or [[social structure]] that individuals and groups operate within. The dominant [[ideology]] or [[religion]] could also be a given parameter. If for example most people follow a certain faith, this shapes their whole cultural life, and is something to be reckoned with that isn't easily changed.

At the same time, however, the given parameters cannot usually determine ''in total'' what an individual or group will do, because they have at least some (and sometimes a great deal) of personal or behavioural autonomy. They can think about their situation, and make some free choices and decisions about what they will do, within the framework of what is objectively possible for them (the choices need not be ''rational'' or ''fully conscious'' ones, they could just be ''non-arbitrary'' choices influenced by emotions and desires). Sentient (self-aware) organisms, of which human beings are the most evolved sort, are able to vary their own response to given situations according to internally evaluated and decided options.

In this sense, [[Karl Marx]] had written:

{{Quotation|"People make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm Karl Marx, ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The past" (what really happened before, as distinct from its results in the present) is not something which can be changed at all in the present, only reinterpreted, and therefore the past is a given constant which delimits what can possibly happen in the present and in the future. If the future seems relatively "open-ended" that is just because in the time-interval between now and the future, new options and actions could significantly alter what exactly the future will be. Yet the variability of possible outcomes in the future is not infinite, but delimited by what happened before.

==Ten implications==
Ten implications of this view are as follows:
*At any point in time, the outcomes of an historical process are partly predetermined, and partly uncertain because they depend on what human choices and decisions will be made in the present. Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.
*While the past and the present rule out some courses of action, a human choice is always possible between a finite number of realistic options, which often enables the experienced analyst to specify the "most likely scenarios" of what could happen in the future. Some things cannot happen, and some things are more likely to happen than others.
*Once an important choice has been made and acted upon, this will have an effect on the realm of possibilities; in particular, it will shift to a greater or lesser extent the parameters delimiting what can happen in the future. Thus, once "a train of events has been set in motion", it will foreclose other possibilities, and also it might open up some new ones. If masses of people make important new choices, whether in response to circumstances or in response to a new idea, a ''qualitative change'' occurs; in that case, most people begin to behave differently.
*The process of history is both determined, in that the given parameters delimit the possible outcomes, but also open-ended, insofar as human action (or inaction) can change the historical outcomes within certain limits. Human history-making is therefore a reciprocal interaction between what people do, and the given circumstances.
*To some extent at least, it is possible to predict with useful accuracy what will happen in the future, if one has sufficient experience, knowledge, and insight into the relevant causal factors at work as well as how they are related. This may be a work of science or sustained practical experience. In turn, future perspectives can importantly influence human action in the present.
*In historical analysis and portrayals, the analytical challenge is to understand what part of a course of events is attributable to conscious human actions and decisions, what part is shaped by the combination of given circumstances in which the human actors had to act, and what exactly is the relationship between them (the link between the "part" and the "whole").
*Because the ability to prove historical assessments scientifically is limited, [[ideology]], a [[mind-set]] or a social [[mentality]] about the state of the world typically plays an important role in the perspectives people develop (Mandel refers here to an idea by [[Lucien Goldmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The role of the individual in history: the case of world war two", in: ''New Left Review'' I-157, May‚ÄìJune 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With hindsight, it may be possible to trace out accurately why events necessarily developed in the way that they did, and not otherwise. But at the time they are happening, this is usually not, or not completely possible, and the [[hope]] (or [[fear]]) for a particular future may play an important role (here Mandel refers to the philosophy of [[Ernst Bloch]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, " Anticipation and Hope as Categories of Historical Materialism", in: ''Historical materialism'', Volume 10, Number 4 / December, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ideology influences whether one looks upon past events as ''failures'' or ''successes'' (as many historians have noted, history is often rewritten by the victors in great historical battles to cast themselves in an especially positive light). There is no "non-partisan" history-writing in this sense, at best we can say the historian had full regard for the known facts pertaining to the given case and frankly acknowledges his biases.
*"History" in general cannot be simply defined as "the past", because it is also "the past living in the present" and "the future living in the present". Historical thinking is not just concerned with what past events led to the present, but also with those elements from the past which are contained in the present and elements that point to the future. It involves both antecedents and consequents, including future effects. Only on that basis can we define how people can "make history" as a conscious [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].
*The main reason for studying history is not because we{{Who|date=April 2017}} should assign praise or blame, or simply because it is interesting, but because we need to study past experience ''to understand the present and the future''. History can be seen as a "laboratory", the lab-record of which shows how, under given conditions, people tried to achieve their goals, and what the results of their experimentations were. This can provide insight into what is likely or unlikely to succeed in future. At the very least, each generation has to come to grips with the experience of the previous generation, as well as educating the future generation.
*The theory of [[historicism]] according to which the historical process as a whole has an overall purpose or [[teleology]] (or "grand design") is rejected. With [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Mandel thought that "'History does nothing... It is people, real, living people who do all that... ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is not, as it were, a person apart, using people as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of people pursuing their aims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#history|title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, with the proviso that people did so within given parameters not of their own making, allowing us to identify broad historical movements as determinate processes. The historical process is also not a matter of linear progress according to inevitable stages‚Äîboth progress and regress can occur, and different historical outcomes are possible depending on what people do.

==Perceptions and illusions==
According to the theory of parametric determinism, the "human problem" in this context is usually not that human beings lack free choice or free will, or that they cannot in principle change their situation (at least to some extent), but rather is their ''awareness'' of the options open to them, and their ''belief'' in their own ability to act on them‚Äîinfluenced as they may be, by their ideology, experience and emotions.

Perceptions of what people can change or act upon may vary a great deal, they might overestimate it, or underestimate it. Thus it may take [[science|scientific inquiry]] to find out what perceptions are realistic. By discovering what the determinism is, we can learn better how we can be free. Simply put, we could "bang our head against a wall", but we could also go over the wall, through a door in the wall, or around the wall. At crucial points, humans can "make history" actively with a high awareness of what they are doing, changing the course of history, but they can also "be made by history" to the extent that they passively conform to (or are forced to conform to) a situation which is mostly not of their own making and which they may not understand.

As regards the latter, Mandel referred to the condition of [[Social alienation|alienation]] in the sense of a diminished belief in the ability to have control over one's own life, or feeling estranged from one's real nature and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The Marxist theory of alienation", in: ''International Socialist Review'', Vol. 3, No. 31, 1970, pp.19-23, 49-50.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/xx/alien.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; People might [[reification (Marxism)|reify]] aspects of their situation. They might regard something as inevitable ("God's will") or judge "nothing could be done to prevent it" when the real point is that, for specific reasons, nobody was prepared to do anything about it‚Äîsomething could have been done, but it wasn't. Thus "historical inevitability" can also be twisted into a convenient apology to justify a course of events.

In this process of making choices within a given objective framework of realistic options, plenty of illusions are also possible, insofar as humans may have all kinds of gradations of (maybe false) awareness about their true situation. They may, as Mandel argues, not even be fully aware of what motivates their own actions, quite aside from not knowing fully what the consequences of their actions will be. A revolutionary seeking to overthrow the old order to make way for a new one obviously faces many "unknowns".

Therefore, human action can have ''[[unintended consequence]]s'', including effects which are completely opposite to what was intended.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz D. Kurz, "Das Problem der nichtintendierten Konsequenzen; Zur Politischen √ñkonomie von Karl Marx". ''Marx-Engels Jahrbuch'' 2012-13, Internationale Marx-Engels-Stiftung, Berlin: Akademie Verlag GmbH, 2013, pp. 75‚Äì122.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that popular illusions can also shape the outcomes of historical events. If most people believe something to be the case, even although it is not true, this fact can also become a parameter limiting what can happen or influencing what will happen.

==Skeptical reply==

Because terrible illusions can occur, some historians are [[skepticism|skeptical]] about the ability of people to change the world for the better in any real and lasting way. [[Postmodernism]] casts doubt on the existence of progress in history as such‚Äîif e.g. Egyptians built the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in 2500&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] landed on the [[moon]] in 1969, this represents no progress for humanity.

However, Mandel argued that this skepticism is itself based on perceptions of what people are able to know about their situation and their history. Ultimately, the skeptic believes that it is impossible for people to have sufficient knowledge of a kind that they can really change the human condition for the better, except perhaps in very small ways. It just is what it is. This skeptical view does not necessarily imply a very "deterministic" view of history however; history could also be viewed as an unpredictable [[wikt:Chaos|chaos]] or too complex to fathom.

However, most [[politician]]s and [[political activism|political activists]] (including Mandel himself) at least do not believe that history generally is an unpredictable chaos, because in that case their own standpoints would be purely arbitrary and be ''perceived'' as purely arbitrary. Usually, they would argue, the chaos is limited in space and time, because in perpetual chaos, human life can hardly continue anyway; in that case, people become reactive beasts. Since people mostly do want to [[wiktionary:survival|survive]], they need some order and predictability. One can understand what really happened in history reasonably well, if one tries. Human beings can understand human experience because they are human, and the more relevant experience they obtain, the better they can understand it.

Conscious human action, Mandel argues, is mainly non-arbitrary and practical, it has a certain "logic" to it even if people are not (yet) fully aware of this. The reality they face is ''ordered'' in basic ways, and therefore can be meaningfully understood. Masses of people might go into a "mad frenzy" sometimes that might be difficult to explain in rational terms, but this is the exception, not the rule. What is true is that a situation of chaos and disorder (when nothing in society seems to work properly anymore) can powerfully accentuate the irrational and non-rational aspects of human behaviour. In such situations, people with very unreasonable ideas can rise to power. This is, according to Mandel, part of the explanation of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, Introduction to Leon Trotsky, ''The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany'', Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1971, pp. 9‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical latency and the possibilities for change==

The concept of parametric determinism has as its corollary the concept of ''historical latency''. It is not just that different historical outcomes are possible, but that each epoch of human history contains quite a few different developmental ''potentials''. The indications of these potentials can be empirically identified, and are not simply a speculation about "what could conceivably happen".

But they are ''latent'' factors in the situation, insofar as they will not necessarily be realised or actualised. Their realisation depends on human action, on the recognition of the potential that is there, and the decision to do something about it. Thus, Mandel argues that both [[socialism]] and [[barbarian|barbarism]] exist as broad "latent" developmental possibilities within modern capitalist society, even if they are not realised, and whether and which of these will be realised, depends on human choices and human actions.

Effective action to change society, he argues, has to set out from the real possibilities there are for an alternative way of doing things, not from abstract speculations about a better world. Some things are realistically possible, but not just "anything" is possible. The analytical challenge‚Äîoften very difficult‚Äîis therefore to understand correctly what the real possibilities are, and which course of action would have the most fruitful effect. One can do only what one is able to do and no more, but much depends on choices about how to spend one's energies.

Typically in [[war]]s and [[revolution]]s, when people exert themselves to the maximum and have to improvise, it is discovered that people can accomplish far more than they previously thought they could do (also captured in the saying "necessity is the mother of invention"). The whole way people think is suddenly changed. But in times of [[cultural pessimism]], general exhaustion prevails and people are generally skeptical or cynical about their ability to achieve or change very much at all. If the bourgeoisie beats down the workers and constrains their freedom, so that workers have to work more and harder for less and less pay, pessimistic moods can prevail for quite some time. If, on the other hand, the bourgeois economy is expanding, the mood of society can become euphoric, and people believe that just about anything is possible. A famous leftwing slogan in [[May 1968]] was "tout est possible" ("anything is possible"). Similarly, in the boom of the later 1990s, many people in rich countries believed that all human problems could finally be resolved.

That is just to say that what is possible to achieve can be both pessimistically underestimated and optimistically exaggerated at any time. Truly conservative people will emphasize how little potential there is for change, while rebels, visionaries, progressives and revolutionaries will emphasize how much could be changed. An important role for [[social science|social scientific inquiry]] and [[historiography]] is therefore to relativise all this, and place it in a more objective perspective by looking at the relevant facts.

==Criticisms==

While Mandel himself made some successful predictions about the future of world society (for instance, he is famous for predicting at the beginning of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The economics of neocapitalism". ''The Socialist Register 1964''. London: Merlin Press, 1964, pp. 56-67.[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/download/5928/2824]&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Milton Friedman]] did, that the [[postwar economic boom]] would end at the close of the decade), his [[Trotskyist]] critics (including his biographer Jan Willem Stutje) argue, with the benefit of hindsight, that he was far too optimistic and hopeful about the possibility of a workers' revolution in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era and after‚Äîand more generally, that his historical optimism distorted his political perspectives, so that he became too "certain" about a future that he could not be so certain about, or else crucially [[ambivalence|ambivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Willem Stutje, ''Ernest Mandel: a rebel's dream deferred''. London: Verso, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is arguably a rather shallow criticism insofar as the situation could well have developed in different directions, which is precisely what Mandel himself argued;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, introduction to ''Beyond Perestroika: The Future of Gorbachev's USSR''. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in politics, one could only try to make the most of the situation at the time, and here pessimism was not conducive to action. But the more substantive criticism is that many of Mandel's future scenarios were simply not realistic, and that in reality things turned out rather differently from what he thought. This raises several questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=1 |issue=6 |year=1936 |pages=894‚Äì904 [pp. 895‚Äì896] |jstor=2084615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*whether the theory of parametric determinism in history is faulty
*whether Mandel's ''application'' of the theory in his analyses was faulty
*how much we can really foresee anyway, and what distinguishes forecast from prophecy.
*whether and how much people learn from history anyway.

In answering these criticisms, Mandel himself would probably have referred to what he often called the "laboratory of history". That is, we can check the historical record, to see who predicted what, the grounds given for the prediction, and the results. On that basis, we can verify empirically what kind of thinking (and what kind of people) will produce the most accurate predictions, and what we can really predict with "usable accuracy". One reason why he favoured [[Marxism]] was because he believed it provided the best intellectual tools for predicting the future of society. He often cited [[Leon Trotsky]] as an example of a good Marxist able to predict the future. Trotsky wrote in 1925 that:

{{Quotation|"The essence of Marxism consists in this, that it approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research, and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record. Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man‚Äôs technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature. Precisely this objective approach '''arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight'''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ‚ÄúDialectical Materialism and Science‚Äù (1925). ''New International'' (New York), Vol.6 No.1, February 1940, pp.24-31.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/09/science.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This may all seem a trivial "academic" or "scholastic" debate, similar to retrospective speculations about "what could have been different", but it has very important implications for the [[socialist]] idea of a [[planned economy]]. Obviously, if it is not possible to predict much about human behaviour with usable accuracy, then not much economic planning is feasible either‚Äîsince a plan requires at least some expectation that its result ''can and will be realised in the future'', even if the plan is regularly adjusted for new (and unanticipated) circumstances. In general, Mandel believed that the degree of predictability in human life was very much dependent on the way society itself was organised. If e.g. many producers competed with each other for profits and markets, based on privatized knowledge and business secrets, there was much unpredictability in what would happen. If the producers coordinated their efforts co-operatively, much would be predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "In Defence of Socialist Planning", ''New Left Review'' I/159, September‚ÄìOctober 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A deeper problem, to which Mandel alludes with his book ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought'', is that ''if'' we regard certain conditions as possible to change for the better, we ''might'' be able to change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible‚Äîwhereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( a similar insight occurs in [[pragmatism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought''. London: NLB, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing. This, however, implies that even when we try our best to be objective and realistic about history or anything else, we remain subjects influenced by ''subjective perceptions'' or elements of [[fear]], [[hope]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or [[faith]] that defy reason or practicality.

It is, simply put, very ''difficult'' to bring scientific truths and political action together, as Marxists aim to do, in such a way that we really change the things we can change for the better to the maximum, and do not try to change things we really cannot change anyway (Marxists call this "the unity of theory and practice"). In other words, the will to change things can involve subjective perceptions of a kind for which even the best historical knowledge may offer no assistance or guide. And all perceptions of "history-making" may inescapably involve [[ideology]], thus‚Äîaccording to skeptics‚Äîcasting some doubt on the very ability of people to distinguish objectively between what can be changed, and what cannot. The boundary between the two might be rather blurry. This is the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s famous philosophy of social change by "small steps" only.

Mandel's reply to this skepticism essentially was to agree that there were always "unknowns" or "fuzzy" areas in human experience; for people to accomplish anything at all or "make their own history", required taking a [[risk]], calculated or otherwise. One could indeed see one's life as a "wager" ultimately staked on a belief, scientifically grounded or otherwise. However, he argued it was one thing to realise all that, but another to say that the "unknowns" are "unknowable". Thus, for good or for ill, "you don't know, what you haven't tried" and more specifically "you don't know, what you haven't tried to obtain knowledge about". The limits of [[knowledge]] and human possibilities could not be fixed in advance by [[philosophy]]; they had to be ''discovered'' through the test of practice. This attitude recalls [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s famous comment that "All social life is essentially ''practical''. All mysteries which lead theory to [[mysticism]] find their rational solution in human practice, and in the comprehension of this practice.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm|title=Theses On Feuerbach by Karl Marx|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandel believed, with Marx, that "[[ignorance]] never helped anybody" except those who profited from its existence ("never underestimate human [[gullibility]], including your own").

The general task of revolutionary science was to overcome ignorance about human life, and this could not very well be done by [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciling]] people with their allegedly "predetermined" [[destiny|fate]] at every opportunity. We all know we will die eventually, but that says little yet about what we can achieve before that point. Skepticism has its uses, but what those uses are, can only be verified from experience; a universal skepticism would be just as ''arbitrary'' as the belief that "anything is possible"‚Äîit did not lead to any new experience from which something could be learnt, including learning about the possibilities of human [[Freedom of will|freedom]]. And such [[learning]] could only occur through making conscious [[choices]] and [[Decision making|decisions]] within given parameters, i.e. in a ''non-arbitrary'' (non-chaotic) environment, permitting at least some [[predictability]] and allowing definite experiential conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/marx-hist/index.htm Ernest Mandel, ''The Place of Marxism in history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel often reiterated that most people do not learn all that much from texts or from history, they learn from their own experience. They might be affected by history without knowing it. But anybody concerned with large-scale [[social change]] was almost automatically confronted with the need to place matters in broader historical perspective. One had to understand deeply the limits, consequences and implications of human action. Likewise, politicians making decisions affecting large numbers of people could hardly do without a profound sense of history.

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering.

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ)‚ÄîAncient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, R√ºdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Moli√®re]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953‚Äì72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"‚Äîthe explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography‚Äîusing mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîis considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism}}
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Eduard Bernstein]], early revisionist]]
Within the [[Marxism|Marxist]] movement, the word '''revisionism''' is used to refer to various ideas, principles and theories that are based on a significant revision of fundamental Marxist premises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Revisionism 1. "A policy first put forward in the 1890s by Edward Bernstein (1850‚Äì1932) advocating the introduction of socialism through evolution rather than revolution, in opposition to the orthodox view of Marxists; hence a term of abuse used within the communist world for an interpretation of Marxism which is felt to threaten the canonical policy." with the first use in English "1903 ''Social-Democrat VII.'' 84 (''heading'') Revisionism in Germany."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most often used by those Marxists who believe that such revisions are unwarranted and represent a "watering down" or abandonment of Marxism‚Äîone such common example is the negation of [[Class conflict#Marxist perspectives|class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm |MAO TSE-TUNG July 1964 On Khrushchov‚Äôs Phoney Communism
and Its Historical Lessons for the World: ... the revisionist Khrushchov clique base themselves mainly on the argument that .. class struggle no longer exists.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, revisionism often carries [[pejorative]] connotations and the term has been used by many different factions. It is typically applied to others and rarely as a self-description. By extension, people who view themselves as fighting against revisionism have often self-identified as [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionists]].

== History ==
The term "revisionism" has been used in a number of contexts to refer to different revisions (or claimed revisions) of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]].

=== 19th century ===
{{Missing information|the origins and impact of, and reaction to, revisionism|date=December 2016}}
In the late 19th century, revisionism was used to describe [[democratic socialist]] writers such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], who sought to revise [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas about the transition to socialism and claimed that a revolution through force was not necessary to achieve a socialist society.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Wolfgang Eichhorn: √úber Eduard Bernstein. Gegensatz und Ber√ºhrungspunkte zu Rosa Luxemburg und W. I. Lenin, in: [[Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. I/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The views of Bernstein gave rise to [[reformism|reformist]] theory, which asserts that socialism can be achieved through gradual peaceful reforms from within a capitalist system.&lt;ref&gt;Philip P. Wiener (ed). [http://etext.virginia.edu/DicHist/dict.html Dictionary of the History of Ideas], Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, in 1973‚Äì74. R. K. Kindersley [http://etext.virginia.edu/DicHist/dict.html Marxist revisionism: From Bernstein to modern forms], website of the [[University of Virginia]] Library. Accessed 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
In the 1920s and 1930s, the International [[Left Opposition]] led by [[Leon Trotsky]], which had been expelled from the [[Communist International]], accused the leadership of the Comintern and [[Soviet Union]] of revising the internationalist principles of Marxism and [[Leninism]] in favor of the aspirations of an [[Bourgeoisie|elite bureaucratic caste]] which had come to power in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1928/3rd/index.htm The Third International After Lenin], The Militant, 1929. Accessed 14 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] saw the nascent [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[bureaucracy]] as a roadblock on the [[proletariat]]'s path to [[World revolution|world socialist revolution]] and to the shifting policies of the Comintern, they counterposed the Marxist theory of [[permanent revolution]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet authorities labeled the Trotskyists as "revisionists" and eventually expelled them from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], whereupon the Trotskyists founded their [[Fourth International]].

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
In the 1940s and 1950s within the international [[communism|communist]] movement, revisionism was a term used by Marxist-Leninists to describe communists who focused on [[consumer goods]] production instead of [[heavy industry]]; accepted national differences instead of promoting [[proletarian internationalism]]; and encouraged [[Liberal socialism|liberal]] reforms instead of remaining faithful to established doctrine. Revisionism was also one of the charges leveled at [[Titoism|Titoists]] as punishment for their pursuit of a relatively independent communist ideology, amidst a series of post-[[World War II]] purges beginning in 1949 in [[Eastern Europe]] by the Soviet administration under Stalin. After Stalin's death, a more democratic form of [[socialism]] briefly became acceptable in [[Hungary]] during [[Imre Nagy]]'s government (1953‚Äì1955) and in [[Poland]] during [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka]]'s government, containing ideas that the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] and the Soviet Union itself variously considered revisionist, although neither Nagy nor Gomu≈Çka described themselves as revisionists, since to do so would have been self-deprecating.

After the 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] that denounced Stalin, many communist activists, astounded and disheartened by what they saw as the betrayal of [[Marxism‚ÄìLeninism|Marxist‚ÄìLeninist]] principles by the very people who had founded them, resigned from western communist parties in protest.{{fact|date=December 2016}} These quitters were sometimes accused of revisionism by those communists who remained in these parties, although some of these same loyalists also shortly thereafter split from the same communist parties in the 1960s to become the [[New Left]]{{fact|date=December 2016}} indicating that they too were disillusioned by the actions of the Soviet Union by that point in time. Most of those who left in the 1960s started aligning themselves with [[Mao Zedong]] as opposed to the Soviet Union.{{fact|date=December 2016}} An example was [[E. P. Thompson]]'s ''[[New Reasoner]]''.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

=== 1960s ===
In the early 1960s, Mao Zedong and the [[Communist Party of China]] revived the term revisionism ({{Lang-zh|‰øÆÊ≠£‰∏ª‰πâ}} ''xi≈´zh√®ng zh«îy√¨'', "doctrine correction") to attack [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and the Soviet Union over various ideological and political issues, as part of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. The Chinese routinely described the Soviets as "modern revisionists" through the 1960s. This usage was copied by the various [[Maoism|Maoist]] groups that split off from communist parties around the world. In 1978, the [[Sino-Albanian split]] occurred, which caused [[Enver Hoxha]], the [[Secretary (title)#Secretary-General|General Secretary]] of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], to also condemn Maoism as revisionist. This caused a split in the Maoist movement, with some following the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Albanian Party of Labour]]'s line, most notably the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist)]].

'''''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings''''' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257&lt;/ref&gt; is a reconstruction of the chronology of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. The book was originally his doctoral dissertation and is widely regarded as the definitive work on the chronology of [[History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah#Iron_Age_II_.281000.E2.80.93587.C2.A0BCE.29|Hebrew Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiele's chronology is accepted in several recent study Bibles, and is the chronology used for the Hebrew monarchs in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (T. C. Mitchell, "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.)" ''CAH'' 3, Part 1, p. 445). Thiele's chronology with the slight modifications of Leslie McFall, ("A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 [1991], pp. 3-45) is accepted in Jack Finegan's influential ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'', rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998), p. 249. See also, in the notes below, the list of scholars who accept his date for the beginning of the divided kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered the classic and comprehensive work in reckoning the accession of kings, calendars, and co-regencies, based on biblical and extra-biblical sources.

==Biblical chronology ==
The chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah rests primarily on a series of reign lengths and cross references within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] or the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and fitting them into the chronology of other ancient civilizations.

However, some of the biblical cross references did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King [[Asa of Judah]] had a cumulative error of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on. He explained this pattern as a result of two different methods of reckoning regnal years: the ''accession year'' method in one and the ''non-accession year'' method in the other. Under the accession year method, if a king died in the middle of a year, the period to the end of that year would be called the "accession year" of the new king, whose Year 1 would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year. Israel appears to have used the non-accession method, while Judah used the accession method until [[Athaliah]] seized power in Judah, when Israel's non-accession method appears to have been adopted in Judah.

In addition, Thiele also concluded that Israel counted years starting in the spring month of [[Nisan]], while Judah counted years starting in the autumn month of [[Tishri]]. The cumulative impact of differing new years and different methods of calculating reigns explained, to Thiele, most of the apparent inconsistencies in the cross references.

Unknown to Thiele when he first published his findings, these same conclusions that the northern kingdom used non-accession years and a spring New Year while the southern kingdom used accession years and a fall New Year had been discovered by [[Valerius Coucke]] of Belgium some years previously, a fact which Thiele acknowledges in his ''Mysterious Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysterious Numbers'', 3rd ed., p. 59, n. 17, citing V. Coucke, "Chronique biblique," in ''Suppl√©ment au Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Based on his conclusions, Thiele showed that the 14 years between [[Ahab]] and [[Jehu]] were really 12 years. This enabled him to date their reigns precisely, for [[Ahab]] is mentioned in the [[Kurkh Monolith|Kurk Stele]] which records the Assyrian advance into Syria/Israel at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, and Jehu is mentioned on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] paying tribute in 841 BC. As these two events are dated by Assyrian chronology as being 12 years apart, Ahab must have fought the Assyrians in his last year and Jehu paid tribute in his first year.

Thiele was able to reconcile the Biblical chronological data from the books of Kings and Chronicles with the exception of synchronisms between [[Hoshea]] of Israel and [[Hezekiah]] of Judah towards the end of the kingdom of Israel and reluctantly concluded that at that point the ancient authors had made a mistake. Oddly, it is at that precise point that he himself makes a mistake, by failing to realize that Hezekiah had a coregency with his father Ahaz, which explains the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms. This correction has been supplied by subsequent writers who built on Thiele‚Äôs work, including Thiele‚Äôs colleague [[Siegfried Horn]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah‚Äôs Reign," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 2 (1964) pp. 48‚Äì49.&lt;/ref&gt; TC Mitchell and [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', 1st ed., JD Douglas, editor; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie McFall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | first = Leslie | last = McFall | title = Translation Guide | page = 12 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rKrw27MI?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-19 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's method in arriving at his chronology has been contrasted with the analytical method employed by [[Julius Wellhausen]] and other scholars who follow some form of the [[documentary hypothesis]]. Wellhausen taught that the chronological data of the books of Kings and Chronicles were artificially put together at a date much later than the events they were ostensibly describing and were basically not historical.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen, ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' (New York: Meridian Books, 1957) p. 151, originally published as ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels'' (Berlin: Reimer, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a necessary consequence of his ''a priori'' assumption that the biblical books as we have them today were the work of late-date editors who could not possibly have known the correct history of the times they were writing about. Theodore Robinson summarized this position as follows: "Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. Robinson, ''A History of Israel'' (Oxford, 1932) I, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellhausen's methodology in interpreting the Scriptures and the history of Israel has therefore been classed by RK Harrison as a deductive approach; that is, one that starts with presuppositions and derives a historical reconstruction from those presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Harrison, "The Critical Use of the OT," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' (Jan‚ÄìMar 1989) pp. 12‚Äì20.&lt;/ref&gt; A necessary consequence of this approach has been that no general agreement has been reached on the chronology of the Hebrew kingdom period as calculated by authors who adopted this method. "The disadvantage of the deductive approach is that nothing is settled for certain; the results obtained are as diverse as the [[presupposition (philosophy)|presupposition]]s of the scholars, since diverse presuppositions produce diverse results."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Rodger C | last = Young | contribution = Inductive and Deductive Methods as Applied to OT Chronology | title = [[The Master's Seminary Journal]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | year = 2007 | page = 102 | format = PDF | contribution-url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj18e.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Thiele's method of determining the chronology of the Hebrew kings was based on induction, that is, making it a matter of first priority to determine the actual methods used by ancient scribes and court recorders in recording the years of kings, as described above. Thiele's inductive method, then, was based on inscriptional evidence from the ancient Near East, and not on the presuppositions followed by liberal scholarship. It is Thiele's method that has produced the determinative studies for the chronology of the kingdom period, not the presupposition-based method, so that even those interpreters who continue in late-date theories for the authorship of Scripture have recognized the credibility of Thiele's scholarship in determining the date for the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, as cited above. The work of Thiele and other textual scholars who have followed an inductive (evidence-based) approach is therefore significant in providing an alternative to the methods of the documentary hypothesis, and the success of that approach has been seen as theologically significant in supporting a high view of the inspiration of Scripture, particularly regarding its integrity in the abundant and complex historical data related to the kingdom period.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the chronological data of the MT [ [[Masoretic text]] ] were not authentic‚Äîthe actual dates and synchronisms for these various kings‚Äîthen neither Thiele nor McFall nor anyone else could have constructed a chronology from them that in every case is faithful to the original texts and in every proven instance is consistent with Assyrian and Babylonian chronology. This mathematical demonstration should sit in judgment over the various theories of text formation: If a theory of text formation cannot explain how the chronological data of the MT has produced a chronology that in every respect seems authentic for the four centuries of the monarchic period, then that theory must be rejected as another example of a presupposition-based approach that cannot meet the rational criteria for credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, review of Christine Tetley's ''The Reconstructed Chronology of the Divided Kingdom'' (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2005), in ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45:2 (2007), pp. 282-283 ([http://home.swbell.net/rcyoung8/TetleyReview.rtf Link]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception==

Thiele's chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars,&lt;ref&gt;'Not all scholars are convinced by this solution, and commentators on the prophetic books often accept that dates can only be approximate.', McConville, G (2002). Exploring the Old Testament, Volume 4: The Prophets (viii).  London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Despite that fact of scholarly dedication, neither Thiele‚Äôs carefully argued University of Chicago dissertation, nor anyone else‚Äôs, has achieved as yet universal acceptance.', Kaiser, WC (1998). A history of Israel: From the bronze age through the Jewish Wars (293). Nashville, TN: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; nor has any other scholar‚Äôs work in this field. Yet the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps has achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology, so that Assyriologist [[Donald Wiseman|DJ Wiseman]] wrote ‚ÄúThe chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele,‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Donald J Wiseman, ''1 and 2 Kings'' in ''[[Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries]]'' (Leicester: Intervarsity, 1993), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, Leslie McFall: ‚ÄúThiele‚Äôs chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, ‚ÄúThe Chronology of Saul and David,‚Äù ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 53 (2010) 215, n. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in his chronology,&lt;ref&gt;'but his harmonizing approach has not gone unchallenged, especially because of the many shifts in the basis of reckoning dates that it requires (e.g., Jepsen 1968: 34‚Äì35)‚Äîshifts which were unlikely in actual practice.', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his final conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;'Driver described Thiele‚Äôs system as an ‚Äúimportant work, which comes very near to, if it does not actually reach, a final solution of the problem of the dates of the kings of Israel and Judah.‚Äù  Even a critic of Thiele‚Äôs system who accused him of manipulating variable factors to achieve his goal of fitting the biblical evidence into Near Eastern history and who described his work as ‚Äúmore a study in numerical ingenuity than in scholarly research‚Äù had to admit that ‚ÄúThiele‚Äôs assumption is validated by the results achieved: inner consistency and harmony and conformity with the fixed dates of ancient Near Eastern history.‚Äù', McFall, Leslie, 'A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles', Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 148. 1991 (589) (4). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, even scholars sharing Thiele's religious convictions have maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.

{{quote |In his desire to resolve the discrepancies between the data in the Book of Kings, Thiele was forced to make improbable suppositions‚Ä¶  There is no basis for Thiele's statement that his conjectures are correct because he succeeded in reconciling most of the data in the Book of Kings, since his assumptions‚Ä¶ are derived from the chronological data themselves‚Ä¶"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=QkgEaWG0_j4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+chronology+of+the+kings+of+Israel+and+Judah#v=onepage&amp;q=Temple&amp;f=false | first = Gershon | last = Galil | title = The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah | publisher = Brill | year = 1996 | page = 4| isbn = 9004106111 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The numerous extrabiblical synchronisms he invokes do not always reflect the latest refinements in Assyriological research (cf. E.2.f below). In many cases, he posits an undocumented event in order to save a biblical datum (e.g., the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Jeroboam II as coregent; Thiele 1983: 109)', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This citation, from a critic of Thiele's system, demonstrates the difference mentioned above between the deductive approach based on presuppositions and an inductive approach based on data, not a priori assumptions. Thiele is criticized here for basing his theories on data or evidence, not on presuppositions.

Despite these criticisms Thiele's methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;'Thiele‚Äôs work has become a cornerstone of much recent chronological discussion (cf. De Vries IDB 1: 580‚Äì99; IDBSup: 161‚Äì66);', Freedman, D. N. (1996).  Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;'Following Thiele‚Äôs revolutionary work, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, a consensus has emerged that the kingdom under Solomon divided at his death in 931 BC.  This date must be the starting point for any chronological reconstruction of previous events.', Merrill, Eugene H, ‚ÄòFixed Dates in Patriarchal Chronology‚Äô, Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 137. 1980 (547) (237). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, ''Handbook'' p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershon Galil]], ''The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah'' (Leiden: Brill, 1996), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFall, "Translation Guide," p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Mitchell in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu," pp. 445-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, ''The Bible Unearthed'' (New York: Free Press, 2001), p. 131 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Finkelstein+%22Bible+Unearthed%22+931&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lQA3Mtd86F&amp;sig=TbXfcHSMjYvizXXLb_jqKnluap8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sKzSSbG2B8nfnQf1n-jJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Link]).&lt;/ref&gt; This has found independent support in the work of J. Liver,&lt;ref&gt;J. Liver, "The Chronology of Tyre at the Beginning of the First Millennium B.C.," ''Israel Exploration Journal'' 3 (1953), p. 113-120&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Moore Cross|Frank M. Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Cross, "An Interpretation of the Nora Stone," ''Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research'' 208 (1972) p. 17, n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and others studying the chronology of the kings of Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of these studies is found in William H. Barnes, ''Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), pp. 29-55, and also in Rodger C. Young, "Three Verifications of Thiele's Date for the Beginning of the Divided Kingdom," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45 (2007), pp. 179-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Thiele's work has found widespread recognition and use across various related scholarly disciplines. His date of 931 BCE, in conjunction with the synchronism between Rehoboam and Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shishak]] in 1 Kings 14:25, is used by Egyptologists to give absolute dates to Egypt‚Äôs [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]], and his work has also been used by scholars in other disciplines to establish Assyrian and Babylonian dates.&lt;ref&gt;'In a 1996 article, Kenneth Strand wrote, ‚ÄúWhat has generally not been given due notice is the effect that Thiele‚Äôs clarification of the Hebrew chronology of this period of history has had in furnishing a corrective for various dates in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian history.‚Äù28  The purpose of Strand‚Äôs article was to show that Thiele‚Äôs methodology accomplished more than just producing a coherent chronology from scriptural data. His chronology, once produced, proved useful in settling some troublesome problems in Assyrian and Babylonian history. As Strand pointed out, this outcome was quite the opposite of what some of Thiele‚Äôs critics asserted, namely that Thiele merely juggled the scriptural data until he could match generally accepted dates from the surrounding nations.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (112‚Äì113). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Thiele's reconstruction led to further research which has refined or even departed from his synthesis. Notable studies of this type include work by Tadmor&lt;ref&gt;'H. Tadmor (EncMiqr 4: 245‚Äì310) bases his chronology upon considerations similar to those of Begrich and Thiele, but assumes far fewer systemic fluctuations; items which are inexplicable are regarded as late editorial calculations or errors.', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'While also somewhat conservative in his approach to the figures in MT, Tadmor‚Äôs pragmatic reconstruction delves into the process by which the redactor(s) of Kings compiled their chronological framework from heterogeneous materials, sometimes leaving traces in textual inconsistencies (Tadmor EncMiqr 4: 45).', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and McFall.&lt;ref&gt;'It remained then for others to complete the application of principles that Thiele used elsewhere, thereby providing a chronology for the eighth-century kings of Judah that is in complete harmony with the reign lengths and synchronisms given in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall‚Äôs 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah‚Äôs Tishri years or Israel‚Äôs Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105‚Äì106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly attitudes towards the Biblical record of the Israelite monarchies from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were largely disparaging, treating the records as essentially fictional and dismissing the value of the regnal synchronisms.&lt;ref&gt;'R. Kittel: ‚ÄúWellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning.. . .‚Äù5 Theodore H. Robinson: ‚ÄúWellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given.‚Äù6 S. R. and G. R. Driver: ‚ÄúSince, however, it is clear on various grounds that these synchronisms are not original, any attempt to base a chronological scheme on them may be disregarded.‚Äù7 Karl Marti: ‚ÄúAlmost along the whole line, the discrepancy between synchronisms and years of reign is incurable.‚Äù8 TMSJ 18:1 (Spring 2007) p. 102 Cyrus Gordon: ‚ÄúThe numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors. . . . [T]he editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully.‚Äù9', Young, Roger C, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' Volume 48. 2005 (2) (233). Lynchburg, VA: The Evangelical Theological Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, modern scholarly attitudes to the monarchical chronology and synchronisms in 1 and 2 Kings has been far more positive subsequent to the work of Thiele and those who have developed his thesis further,&lt;ref&gt;' The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall‚Äôs 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah‚Äôs Tishri years or Israel‚Äôs Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen. That was the logical outgrowth of Thiele‚Äôs work, and it attained a holy grail that had been sought for twenty-two centuries, namely a rational explanation of the chronological data of the Hebrew monarchies that was consistent with the scriptural texts used to construct the chronology, and also consistent with several fixed dates from Assyrian and Babylonian history.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105‚Äì106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; a change in attitude to which recent archaeology has contributed.&lt;ref&gt;'Grabbe suggests that the names and sequence of kings in Israel and Judah, and their approximate chronological placement, agrees with what can be gleaned from extra-biblical sources. To this extent the biblical framework (meaning primarily 1 and 2 Kings) is reliable: even if we had no external sources we could have reasonable confidence in the biblical sequence of Jeroboam I, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Omri, Ahab, Jehu, etc. in Samaria, and David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat, etc. in Jerusalem, along with their interrelationships. Beyond that it starts to get more and more tricky, with decreasing reliability in the biblical narrative as the detail increases (this is a general statement, and there are sometimes exceptions in specific instances).', Grabbe, L. L. (2007). Reflections on the Discussion. In L. L. Grabbe (Ed.), Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty (L. L. Grabbe, Ed.) (337). London: T&amp;T Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">The '''Transgender Oral History Project''' is an initiative by and for the transgender community. TOHP collects interviews and produces multimedia content featuring a stories of [[transgender]]-identified people, and exists to empower trans folks through sharing stories of their lives. The Transgender Oral History Project is also active in the community, hosting events in many states including [[Massachusetts]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], Seattle, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]].

==Goals==
According to the official website, the Transgender Oral History Project's goals are to build community, encourage inter-generational discussion, framing contemporary issues that transgender people faced within a broader context, highlight individuals, communities, and organizations struggling with trans issues that are not addressed by mainstream discourses and portray how political, social, and historical circumstances impact transgender lives.

== Founding ==
The Trans Oral History project was founded in 2009 by Andr√© P√©rez as began documenting the evolution of the first ever New England Transgender Pride March. He went on to create a multimedia exhibit entitled, "Community in Transition: 40 Years of Struggle" that incorporated archival materials from the Sexual Minorities Archives and the first set of interviews from the Transgender Oral History Project. This exhibit has been featured at Marlboro College, University of Illinois Chicago, and the Translating Identities Conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvm.edu/~tic/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wallblake House''' is a heritage [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] house and museum annex in [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]], [[Anguilla]] in the northeastern [[Caribbean]]. Built in 1787 by Will Blake, a sugar planter, it is stated to be the oldest structure on the island.&lt;ref name="Berkmoes2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkmoes|first=Ryan Ver|title=Caribbean Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ud4nnpZPn-0C&amp;pg=PA423|accessdate=2 January 2011|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-575-9|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although gutted by the French in the late 1790s, it was rebuilt by the British and today has been fully restored, with its kitchen complex, stables and slave quarters intact.

Wallblake House is one of the ten heritage houses in The Valley that was refurbished over a seven-year period and completed in 2004, at a cost of [[East Caribbean dollar|EC]]$250,000 (about US$92,000). The Wallblake Trust gained the support of the Catholic Church, many local enthusiasts and NGOS. The Heritage Trail Committee has raised the status of this house consequent to an agreement between the Wallblake Trust and the Anguilla Heritage Trail.&lt;ref name=blake&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anguillian.com/article/articleview/8740/1/140/|title= Wallblake House: The Anguilla Heritage Trail's New Headquarters|accessdate=25 December 2010|publisher= Anguillian News paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Anguilla's only surviving plantation house.&lt;ref name="Fodor2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Inc.

==History==
The house was built in the mid to late 1700s. The name "Walblake" is probably a distortion of Valentine Blake, whose property in the Valley is mentioned in a deed from the 1690s. The construction date, 1787, is noted from an inscription on an old brick on the northern kitchen wing.&lt;ref name=Past/&gt; The first historical event that occurred at the house was the French invasion by [[Victor Hugues]] of this island in 1796 when the Wallblake House witnessed a ‚Äúcrippled Anguillian‚Äù known as Hodge, taking shelter in its cellar. However, he could not escape the French soldiers who caught and executed him. This was followed by their gutting the property. The execution of the injured Anguillian further lead to a reparation reflex reaction by the Anguillians as they executed the French prisoners of war who had been detained in the Old Court House on Crocus Hill, without trial. However, the French were not successful in their invasion effort as the local Angullians put up a brave fight and were supported by the British ship, the [[HMS Lapwing|HMS ''Lapwing'']], arriving on the scene at the right time. After this incident, the Wallblake estate was rebuilt.&lt;ref name=Past/&gt;&lt;ref name=blake/&gt; The house was owned by the planter Valentine Blake for some time.&lt;ref name="PermenterBigley2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Permenter|first1=Paris|last2=Bigley|first2=John|title=Anguilla, Antigua, St. Barts, St. Kitts, St. Martin including Sint Maarten, Barbuda &amp; Nevis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFWfCEgS-bcC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=2 January 2011|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-55650-909-4|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, when Anguilla experienced severe drought, the estate resorted to raising economic crops such as sugar and cotton over an area of {{convert|97|acres}} of plantation, but with little success, the same being true with the other Anguillian plantations.&lt;ref name="Henderson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=James|title=Caribbean &amp; the Bahamas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMM_yrOxqZkC&amp;pg=PA405|accessdate=2 January 2011|date=1 October 2005|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-86011-212-6|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the estate saw several owners.  In the 1900s, it was with Carter Rey, a rich business baron who had bought the estate from the Lake family. Next, it was owned by his younger brother Frank Rey. In 1959,  Marie Rey Lake, who had converted from the Anglican Church to being a Roman Catholic, donated the house to the Catholic Church, which continues to own it till this day. The house was leased to the Department of Tourism in 1978 for a time when they refurbished it. After the lease expired, the house was returned to the Roman Catholic Church and currently functions as a rectory.&lt;ref name=Past/&gt;&lt;ref name=News&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.ai/ref/wallblakerestored.html|title= The Wallblake House‚Ä¶. Beautifully Restored|accessdate=25 December 2010|publisher=Bob Green‚Äôs The Anguilla News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now the heritage monument is being planned to depict the history of the island and the Anguilla‚Äôs Heritage Trail. In this effort, Lilli Azevedo, an archaeologist and Heritage Trail Committee member who is providing the narration support, has planned to give expositions of the archaeological findings of [[Fountain Cavern]] related to  the [[Amerindian]] [[archaeology]] of Anguilla.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;

==Architecture and features==
The house has a stone foundation. The roof is formed with [[Guyana|Guyanese]] hardwood and is shingled. The upper section is wooden.&lt;ref name="Henderson2005" /&gt; The original structure was built with dressed stones that were probably brought from [[East End, Anguilla|East End]] or even [[Scrub Island, Anguilla|Scrub Island]].  The lime mortar for jointing was made from a mixture of burnt coral and shells with admixtures of molasses and marl. The original timber has been retained in the upper floors. The structure has double paneling.  Intricate carvings on its edges give the effect of a "tray ceiling", that is, the appearance of inverted trays hung from the roof as if rope is tied to the edges to hide any defects in its construction.

The heritage building has been restored to its original design and colour scheme. The elegant and decorative designs that existed in the original building have been fully retained.&lt;ref name=News/&gt;

==Grounds==
The grounds have a bakery, cistern,&lt;ref name="Greenberg2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Harriet|title=St Martin, St Barts &amp; Anguilla Alive!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sfa4DI-bmd0C&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=31 May 2003|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-58843-356-5|pages=290‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stable block.&lt;ref name="HannaStanford2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Nick|last2=Stanford|first2=Emma|title=National Geographic Traveler: Caribbean 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZe33sTKGOoC&amp;pg=PT219|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=18 September 2007|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0141-7|pages=219‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall, Spanish bayonet trees are on the property.&lt;ref name=Past/&gt; An adjacent church has a unique decorative stone front facade.&lt;ref name="GorryMiller2005" /&gt;

==Tourism==
Set behind a white picket fence,&lt;ref name="Henderson2005" /&gt; Wallblake is now a private house, and living quarters to the priest from St Gerard's Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Cameron2005" /&gt;  However, tours can be arranged.&lt;ref name="GorryMiller2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorry|first1=Conner|last2=Miller|first2=Debra|title=Caribbean Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJObOeOb0wEC&amp;pg=PA406|accessdate=3 January 2011|year=2005|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-055-5|pages=406‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also serves as a museum annex,&lt;ref name="HannaStanford2007" /&gt; as well as a venue for art shows,&lt;ref name="Cameron2005" /&gt; flower shops and marriage receptions.  The International Airport in The Valley, just to the south of the house was also named as [[Wallblake Airport]], now renamed as [[Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]].
