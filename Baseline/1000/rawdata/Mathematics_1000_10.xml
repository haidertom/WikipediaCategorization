      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57124">'''Antiquarian science books''' are original historical works (e.g., books or technical papers)  concerning [[List of important publications in science|science]], [[List of important publications in mathematics|mathematics]] and sometimes [[engineering]]. 
These books are important primary references for the study of the [[history of science and technology]], they can provide valuable insights into the historical development of the various fields of scientific inquiry ([[History of science]], [[History of mathematics]], etc.)

The landmark  are significant first (or early) editions typically worth hundreds or thousands of dollars (prices may vary widely based on condition, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Prices quoted were collected using sources such as {{cite web|url=https://ilab.org/buy_books |title=International League of Antiquarian Booksellers |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509062742/http://www.ilab.org/services/searchform.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 }}  {{cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/ |title=ABAA |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701041121/http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/searchform.php |archivedate=2009-07-01 }} http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchEntry http://www.sothebys.com http://www.christies.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reprints of these books are often available, for example from [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Dover Publications]] or [[Google Book Search|Google Books]].

[[Incunabula]] are extremely rare and valuable, but as the "[[scientific revolution]]" is only taken to have started around the 1540s, such works of [[Renaissance literature]] (including [[alchemy]], [[Renaissance magic]], etc.) are not usually included under the notion of "scientific" literature. Printed originals of the beginning scientific revolution thus date to the 1540s or later, notably beginning with the original publication of [[Copernican heliocentrism]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'  ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' of 1543 sold for more than US$2 million at auctions.&lt;ref&gt;US$2,210,500 at a [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/copernicus-nicolaus-de-revolutionibus-orbium-coelestium-5084091-details.aspx Christies] auction in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of notable books==
&lt;!-- for an item to be listed here, it should either have a dedicated Wikipedia article already, or there should be a citation confirming that the book is either widely considered a "milestone" or something, or that the book has been sold for a huge sum at some auction, etc.

The '''Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)''' is a professional society whose mission is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. The AWM was founded in 1971 and incorporated in the state of Massachusetts.  AWM has approximately 5200 members, including over 250 institutional members, such as colleges, universities, institutes, and mathematical societies.  It offers numerous programs and workshops to mentor women and girls in the mathematical sciences.  Much of AWM’s work is supported through federal grants.

==History==
The Association was founded in 1971 as the Association of Women Mathematicians, but the name was changed almost immediately.  As reported in "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives", by [[Lenore Blum]], "As Judy Green remembers (and [[Chandler Davis]], early AWM friend, concurs): 'The formal idea of women getting together and forming a caucus was first made publicly at a MAG [Mathematics Action Group] meeting in 1971 ... in Atlantic City.  Joanne Darken, then an instructor at Temple University and now at the Community College of Philadelphia, stood up at the meeting and suggested that the women present remain and form a caucus.  I have been able to document six women who remained: me (I was a graduate student at Maryland at the time), Joanne Darken, Mary [W.] Gray (she was already at American University), Diane Laison (then an instructor at Temple), Gloria Olive (a Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand who was visiting the U.S. at the time) and [[Annie Selden]]... It's not absolutely clear what happened next, except that I've personally always thought that Mary was responsible for getting the whole thing organized ....'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm-math.org/articles/notices/199107/blum/node2.html#SECTION02010000000000000000 |title=A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics (from Notices): How it was |publisher=Awm-math.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary W. Gray]] was the early organizer, placing an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the AMS, and writing the first issue of the ''AWM Newsletter'' that May.  Early goals of the association focused on equal pay for equal work, as well as equal consideration for admission to graduate school and support while there; for faculty appointments at all levels; for promotion and for tenure; for administrative appointments; and for government grants, positions on review and advisory panels and positions in professional organizations. The AWM holds an annual meeting at the [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]].  In 2011 the association initiated a biennial Research Symposium during its 40th anniversary celebration 40 Years and Counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Years and Counting: 2011 is AWM’s 40th Anniversary Year!|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/awm40events|website=Association for Women in Mathematics|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lectures==
The AWM sponsors three honorary lecture series.&lt;ref name=AWMPrograms&gt;{{cite web |title=AWM Programs |url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs |publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics |accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Noether Lecture]]s – honor women who "have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences". Presented in association with the [[American Mathematical Society]], the lecture is given at the annual [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]].
* The [[AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer|Falconer Lectures]] – honor women who "have made distinguished contributions to the mathematical sciences or mathematics education. Presented in association with the [[Mathematical Association of America]], the lecture is given at the annual [[MathFest]].
* The Kovalevsky Lectures – honor women who have "made distinguished contributions in applied or computational mathematics". Presented in association with the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM), the lecture is given at the SIAM Annual Meeting. The lecture series is named for the mathematician [[Sonia Kovalevsky]].

==Awards==
The AWM sponsors several awards and prizes.&lt;ref name=AWMPrograms /&gt;

* [[Alice T. Schafer]] Prize – given each year "to an undergraduate woman for excellence in mathematics".
* [[Louise Hay Award]] – given each year for "outstanding achievements of a woman in mathematics education".
* [[M. Gweneth Humphreys Award]] – given each year for "outstanding mentorship activities of a woman in the mathematical sciences".
* [[Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize]] – given each year to a woman recently tenured in mathematics.  The prize funds a semester in residence at [[Cornell University]] without teaching obligations.

Three recently created prizes for early-career women are also sponsored by the AWM.&lt;ref name=AWMPrograms /&gt;

* AWM-Birman Research Prize – given every other year beginning in 2015 for "exceptional research in topology/geometry".
* AWM-Microsoft Research Prize – given every other year beginning in 2014 for "exceptional research in algebra/number theory".
* [[Sadosky Prize|AWM-Sadosky Research Prize]] – given every other year beginning in 2014 for "exceptional research in analysis".

The AWM Fellows program recognizes "individuals who have demonstrated a sustained commitment to the support and advancement of women in the mathematical sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of the AWM Fellows Program|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/awm-fellows|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''big q-Legendre polynomials''' are an [[orthogonal polynomials|orthogonal family]] of polynomials defined in terms of [[basic hypergeometric function|Heine's basic hypergeometric series]] as&lt;ref&gt;Roelof Koekoek, Peter Lesky, Rene Swattouw,Hypergeometric Orthogonal Polynomials and Their q-Analogues, p 443,Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle   P_n(x;c;q)={}_3\phi_2(q^{-n},q^{n+1},x;q,cq;q,q) &lt;/math&gt;.

They obey the orthogonality relation

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{cq}^q P_m(x;c;q)P_n(x;c;q) \, dx=q(1-c)\frac{1-q}{1-q^{2n+1}}\frac{(c^{-1}q;q)_n}{(cq;q)_n}(-cq^2)^n q^{n \choose 2}\delta_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;

and have the limiting behavior

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\lim_{q \to 1} P_n(x;0;q)=P_n(2x-1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[Legendre polynomial]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A '''blockchain''',{{R|te20151031|fortune20160515|nyt20160521}} originally '''block chain''',{{R|primer|obmh}} is a growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked using [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name="te20151031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Narayanan|first1= Arvind|last2= Bonneau|first2= Joseph|last3= Felten|first3= Edward|last4= Miller|first4= Andrew|last5= Goldfeder|first5= Steven|title= Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction|date= 2016|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton|isbn= 978-0-691-17169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block contains a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt; a [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]], and transaction data (generally represented as a [[merkle tree]] root hash).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, [[distributed ledger]] that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;{{cite news |last= Iansiti |first= Marco |last2= Lakhani |first2= Karim R. |url= https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |title= The Truth About Blockchain |work= [[Harvard Business Review]] |publisher= [[Harvard University]] |date= January 2017 |accessdate =2017-01-17 |quote =The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. |deadurl= no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052537/https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |archivedate= 18 January 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For use as a distributed [[ledger]], a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network collectively adhering to a [[Protocol (communication)|protocol]] for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [[secure by design]] and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. [[Decentralized]] consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.&lt;ref name="decapp"&gt;{{cite book |title =Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |last =Raval |first=Siraj |year =2016 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |oclc =968277125 |isbn =978-1-4919-2452-5 |chapter =What Is a Decentralized Application? |chapter-url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} |pages =[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} 1]–[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =2|plainurl =yes}} 2] |url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl =yes}} |accessdate =6 November 2016 |via =Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)]]
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haber|first1=Stuart|last2=Stornetta|first2=W. Scott|title=How to time-stamp a digital document|journal=Journal of Cryptology|date=January 1991|volume=3|issue=2|pages=99–111|doi=10.1007/bf00196791|citeseerx=10.1.1.46.8740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [[Merkle tree]]s to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bayer|first1=Dave|last2=Haber|first2=Stuart|last3=Stornetta|first3=W. Scott|title=Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping|journal=Sequences|date=March 1992|volume=2|pages=329–334|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-9323-8_24|isbn=978-1-4613-9325-2|citeseerx=10.1.1.71.4891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [[Hashcash]]-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.{{r|cryptocurrencytech}} The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [[bitcoin]], where it serves as the public [[ledger]] for all transactions on the network.{{R|te20151031}}

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20&amp;nbsp;GB ([[gigabyte]]s).&lt;ref name="hadi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |editor-last=Chuen |editor-first=David LEE Kuo |year=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802351-8 |chapter=A Light Touch of Regulation for Virtual Currencies |last1=Nian |first1=Lam Pak |last2=Chuen |first2=David LEE Kuo |page=319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30&amp;nbsp;GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50&amp;nbsp;GB to 100&amp;nbsp;GB in size.

The words ''block'' and ''chain'' were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, ''blockchain,'' by 2016.  The term ''blockchain 2.0'' refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with "a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level."{{R|te20151031}}

{{asof|2016}}, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to require an off-chain [[Oracle (computer science)|oracle]] to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions [that need] to interact with the blockchain."&lt;ref name=bletchleyWP201609&gt;[https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md Project Bletchley Whitepaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111135615/https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md |date=11 January 2017 }}, Microsoft, 2016-09-19.

According to [[Accenture]], an application of the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [[early adopter]]s phase.&lt;ref name="tfob"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |title=The future of blockchain in 8 charts |accessdate=3 December 2016 |date=27 June 2016 |work=Raconteur |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234125/http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |archivedate=2 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [[Chamber of Digital Commerce]].

In May 2018, [[Gartner]] found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/05/04/hype-killer-only-1-of-companies-are-using-blockchain-gartner-reports/|title=Hype Killer - Only 1% of Companies Are Using Blockchain, Gartner Reports {{!}} Artificial Lawyer|date=2018-05-04|work=Artificial Lawyer|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

A blockchain is a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]], [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved [[Storage_record|record]] cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.{{R|te20151031}}&lt;ref name="wired20161107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |title=Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108130946/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |archivedate=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Gans|first2=Joshua S.|date=23 November 2016|title=Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain|ssrn=2874598|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2874598|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [[peer-to-peer]] network and a distributed timestamping server. They are [[Authentication|authenticated]] by [[mass collaboration]] powered by [[collective]] [[self-interest]]s.&lt;ref name="hwb"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |first1=Don |last1=Tapscott |authorlink1=Don Tapscott |first2=Alex |last2=Tapscott |authorlink2=Alex Tapscott |title=Here's Why Blockchains Will Change the World |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=8 May 2016 |magazine=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113134748/http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |archivedate=13 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a design facilitates [[robustness (computer science)|robust]] [[workflow]] where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [[Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility]] from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [[double spending]]. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |first=Kariappa |last=Bheemaiah |date=January 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.&lt;ref name="cbh"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |title=Can blockchain help the cards and payments industry? |first=Michele |last=Tucci |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=29 November 2015 |website=Tech in Asia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120304/https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain can maintain [[title (property)|title rights]] because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [[offer and acceptance]].

===Blocks===
Blocks hold batches of valid [[Transaction processing|transactions]] that are hashed and encoded into a [[Merkle tree]].&lt;ref name="te20151031"/&gt; Each block includes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.&lt;ref name=te20151031 /&gt; This [[Iteration|iterative]] process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt;

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time.  They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks.  Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially&lt;ref name="bsm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, in a blockchain using the [[proof-of-work system]], the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of [[computation]]. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and [[Parallel computing|parallel]] manner.&lt;ref name="permbloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |title=Permissioned Blockchains |website=Explainer |publisher=Monax |accessdate=20 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120154948/https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |archivedate=20 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Block time====
The ''block time'' is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-does-Block-Time-mean-in-cryptocurrency|title=What does "Block Time" mean in cryptocurrency?|author=Muhammad Ghayas|website=[[Quora]]|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.&lt;ref name="drd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |title=Disney Reveals Dragonchain, an Interoperable Ledger |first=Jamie |last=Redman |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=25 October 2016 |website=Bitcoin.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102001523/https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |archivedate=2 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|title=Why is Ethereum different to Bitcoin?|author=Antonio Madeira|website=CryptoCompare|date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072118/https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|archivedate=22 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hard forks ====
{{Transcluded section|Fork (blockchain)}}
{{trim|{{#section-h:Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}}}

=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad-hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}

Every [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [[Data quality]] is maintained by massive database [[Replication (computing)|replication]]&lt;ref name="decapp"/&gt; and [[computational trust]].

=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more [[usability|user-friendly]] than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.&lt;ref name="tapscott201605" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarTech"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Permissionless ====
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt; This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt;

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [[Hashcash]] puzzles.  While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [[Adam Back]], the original idea was first proposed by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

Financial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.&lt;ref name="trtb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |title=The Road To Bitcoin Adoption Passes Through Many Stages |first=J.P. |last=Buntinx |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=1 May 2016 |website=News BTC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220062128/http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, [[venture capital]] investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.&lt;ref name="btt17"/&gt; Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. {{asof|2018|04}}, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====
{{main|Distributed ledger}}
Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.&lt;ref name="btit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |title=Blockchain: The Invisible Technology That's Changing the World |author=Bob Marvin |accessdate=25 September 2017 |date=30 August 2017 |newspaper=PC MAG Australia |publisher=ZiffDavis, LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925180800/http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |archivedate=25 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks "with private blockchains, independent of the public system."&lt;ref name=nyt20160327/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|title=Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum|first=Nathaniel|last=Popper|date=27 February 2017|via=''The New York Times''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620134100/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=this claim does not seem to make sense knowing that Ethereum blockchain is public, not private|date=September 2017}}

==== Disadvantages of private blockchain====
Nikolai Hampton pointed out in ''[[Computerworld]]'' that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [[financial crisis]] or [[debt crisis]] like the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,&lt;ref name="SalsmanTheFinancial13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |title=The Financial Crisis Was A Failure Of Government, Not Free Markets |author=Salsman, R.M. |website=Forbes |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeeffeThePolitical15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |title=The political economy of financial crisis policy |author=O'Keeffe, M.; Terzi, A. |website=Bruegel |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power—it's time consuming and expensive."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors.

== Uses ==
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a [[distributed ledger]] for [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], most notably [[bitcoin]]. There are a few operational products maturing from [[proof of concept]] by late 2016.&lt;ref name="btt17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |title=Blockchain Top Trends In 2017 |first=James |last=Ovenden |publisher=The Innovation Enterprise |accessdate=4 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130143727/https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, some observers remain skeptical. Steve Wilson, of Constellation Research, believes the technology has been [[media circus|hyped]] with unrealistic claims.&lt;ref name="almeve"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |title=Blockchain: Almost Everything You Read Is Wrong |first=Steve |last=Wilson |date=3 May 2016 |publisher=Constellation Research Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002256/https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate [[risk management|risk]], businesses are reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.&lt;ref name="clsdips"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |title=CLS dips into blockchain to net new currencies |author=Katie Martin |accessdate=7 November 2016 |date=27 September 2016 |newspaper=Financial Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152317/https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptocurrencies ===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the [[bitcoin network]] and [[Ethereum]] network are blockchain-based. On May 8, 2018 [[Facebook]] confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Kurt |title=Facebook is making its biggest executive shuffle in company history |url=https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain |website=Recode |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be headed by [[David A. Marcus|David Marcus]] who previously was in charge of [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]]. According to [[The Verge]] Facebook is planning to launch its own [[cryptocurrency]] for facilitating payments on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gartenberg |first1=Chaim |title=Facebook reportedly plans to launch its own cryptocurrency |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344318/facebook-cryptocurrency-token-blockchain-report-david-marcus |website=The Verge |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart contracts ===
{{main|Smart contract}}
Blockchain-based [[smart contract]]s are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.&lt;ref name="unbi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics |last=Franco |first=Pedro |year=2014 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-119-01916-9 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=4 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214204859/https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |archivedate=14 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of a smart contract is [[automation|automated]] [[escrow]]. An [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce [[moral hazard]]s and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.&lt;ref name="vcab"&gt;{{cite book | title = Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations | series = IMF Discussion Note | year = 2016 | publisher = International Monetary Fund | isbn = 978-1-5135-5297-2 | page = 23 | url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | accessdate = 2018-04-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180414210721/https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | archivedate = 2018-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ([[digital asset]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|date=2017-05-12|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the video game industry, while blockchain use is seen as part of a marketplace mechanism, such as with [[Robot Cache]], blockchain is also postulated as a way to share video game assets between various games. The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of [[Ubisoft]] and [[Fig (company)|Fig]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/leading-blockchain-and-gaming-companies-form-blockchain-game-alliance/ | title=  Leading Blockchain and Gaming Companies Form Blockchain Game Alliance | first = Jimmy | last = Aki | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[Bitcoin Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===

==Types of blockchains==
Currently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and [[consortium]] blockchains.

===Public blockchains===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}} to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]).&lt;ref name=Perfectial&gt;{{cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

===Private blockchains===
A private blockchain is permissioned.&lt;ref name="btit"/&gt; One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.

===Consortium blockchains===
A consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single [[organization]] controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a [[Node (networking)|node]] on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.

[[File:BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg|thumb|Blockchain panel discussion at the first [[IEEE Computer Society]] TechIgnite conference]]

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Tucker|first2=Catherine E.|date=11 August 2016|title=Seeding the S-Curve?

{{about|the table by Jost Bürgi||Canon Sinuum (disambiguation){{!}}Canon Sinuum}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}
The '''''Canon Sinuum''''' was a historic table of [[sine]]s thought to have given the sines to 8 sexagesimal places between 0 and 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] in steps of 2 [[arc seconds]]. Some authors believe that the table was only between 0 and 45 degrees. It was created by [[Jost Bürgi]] at the end of the [[16th century]]. Such tables were essential for [[navigation]] at sea. [[Johannes Kepler]] called the ''Canon Sinuum'' the most precise known table of sines.

This table is thought to be lost.

The ''Canon Sinuum'' was computed by Bürgi's [[algorithm]]s explained in his work [[Fundamentum Astronomiae]] presented to Emperor Rudolf II. in 1592.&lt;ref name="staudacher"&gt;Staudacher, S., 2014.  Jost Bürgi, Kepler und der Kaiser.  Verlag NZZ, Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Launert, Nova Kepleriana
Bürgis Kunstweg im Fundamentum Astronomiae - Entschlüsselung seines Rätsels, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms made use of differences and were one of the early uses of [[difference calculus]].&lt;ref name="folkerts"&gt;Menso Folkerts, Dieter Launert, Andreas Thom (Oct 2015). "Jost Bürgi's Method for Calculating Sines." https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03180&lt;/ref&gt; The largest trigonometrical table actually contained in the Fundamentum Astronomiae is a table giving the sines for every minute of the quadrant and to 5 to 7 sexagesimal places.

The manuscript of Fundamentum Astronomiae is now in the collection of the Biblioteka Uniwersytecka in [[Wrocław]], Poland.

The '''counting board''' is the precursor of the [[abacus]], and the earliest known form of a counting device (excluding fingers and other very simple methods). Counting boards were made of stone or wood, and the counting was done on the board with beads, or pebbles etc. Not many boards survive because of the perishable materials used in their construction. 

The oldest known counting board, the [[Salamis Tablet]] (''c.'' 300 BC) was discovered on the Greek island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103213141/http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought to have been used by the Babylonians in about 300 BC and is more of a gaming board than a calculating device. It is marble, about 150 x 75 x 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and is in the [[Greek National museum]] in [[Athens]].  It has carved Greek letters and parallel grooves. 

The German mathematicican [[Adam Ries]] described the use of counting boards in ''Rechenbuch auf Linien und Ziphren in allerlei Handthierung / geschäfften und Kaufmanschafft''. In the novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', [[Hilary Mantel]] refers to [[Thomas Cromwell]] using a counting board in 16th-century England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14271">{{For|dependent and independent random variables|Independence (probability theory)}}
In [[mathematical modeling]], [[statistical model]]ing and [[experimental science]]s, the values of '''dependent [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]]''' depend on the values of '''independent variables'''. The dependent variables represent the output or outcome whose variation is being studied. The independent variables, also known in a statistical context as '''regressors''', represent inputs or causes, that is, potential reasons for variation. In an experiment, any variable that the experimenter manipulates can be called an independent variable.  Models and experiments test the effects that the independent variables have on the dependent variables. Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other reasons, such as to account for their potential [[confounding]] effect.[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|In single variable [[calculus]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is typically [[graph of a function|graphed]] with the [[horizontal axis]] representing the independent variable and the [[vertical axis]] representing the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Nancy Baxter. Workshop calculus: guided exploration with review. Vol. 2. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1998. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In this function, ''y'' is the dependent variable and ''x'' is the independent variable.]]

==Mathematics==

In mathematics, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a rule for taking an input (in the simplest case, a number or set of numbers)&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;Carlson, Robert. A concrete introduction to real analysis. CRC Press, 2006. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; and providing an output (which may also be a number).&lt;ref name=carlson/&gt; A symbol that stands for an arbitrary input is called an '''independent variable''', while a symbol that stands for an arbitrary output is called a '''dependent variable'''.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2011. Section 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symbol for the input is ''x'', and the most common symbol for the output is ''y''; the function itself is commonly written &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Howard, Irl C. Bivens, and Stephen Davis. Calculus Single Variable. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012. Section 0.1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to have multiple independent variables and/or multiple dependent variables. For instance, in [[multivariable calculus]], one often encounters functions of the form &lt;math&gt;z=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''z'' is a dependent variable and ''x'' and ''y'' are independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Ron, and Bruce Edwards. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2009. Section 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; Functions with multiple outputs are often referred to as [[vector-valued functions]].

In [[set theory]], a function between a [[set (mathematics)|set]] '''X''' and a set '''Y''' is a  [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; such that every element of '''X''' appears in an ordered pair with exactly one element of '''Y'''. In this situation, a symbol representing an element of '''X''' may be called an independent variable and a symbol representing an element of '''Y''' may be called a dependent variable, such as when '''X''' is a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] and the symbol ''x'' represents an arbitrary point in the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbacek, Karel, and Thomas Jech. Introduction to Set Theory, Revised and Expanded. Vol. 220. Crc Press, 1999. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; However, many advanced textbooks do not distinguish between dependent and independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a Google Books search for "independent variable" on Mar 18, 2015 brought up 0 hits in the following advanced textbooks:
*Munkres, James R. Topology: a first course. Vol. 23. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975.
*Hungerford, Thomas. Abstract algebra: an introduction. Cengage Learning, 2012.
*Abbott, Stephen. Understanding analysis. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
In an [[design of experiments|experiment]], a variable, manipulated by an experimenter, is called an independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/variables.html&lt;/ref&gt; The dependent variable is the event expected to change when the independent variable is manipulated.&lt;ref name="randomHouse"&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.'' Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 534, 971. {{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[data mining]]  tools (for [[multivariate statistics]] and [[machine learning]]), the dependent variable is assigned a ''role'' as '''{{visible anchor|target variable}}''' (or in some tools as ''label attribute''), while an independent variable may be assigned a role as ''regular variable''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1xltkxylmzx3z8gd647akcdvov.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rapidminer-5.0-manual-english_v1.0.pdf English Manual version 1.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210002634/http://1xltkxylmzx3z8gd647akcdvov.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rapidminer-5.0-manual-english_v1.0.pdf |date=2014-02-10 }} for [[RapidMiner]] 5.0, October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Known values for the target variable are provided for the training data set and [[test data]] set, but should be predicted for other data. The target variable is used in [[supervised learning]] algorithms but not in unsupervised learning.

===Modeling===
In [[mathematical modeling]], the dependent variable is studied to see if and how much it varies as the independent variables vary. In the simple [[stochastic]] [[linear model]] &lt;math&gt;y_i = a + bx_i + e_i&lt;/math&gt; the term &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value of the dependent variable and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value of the independent variable. The term &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is known as the "error" and contains the variability of the dependent variable not explained by the independent variable.

With multiple independent variables, the model is &lt;math&gt;y_i = a + bx_{1,i} + bx_{2,i} + ... + bx_{n,i} + e_i&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of independent variables.

===Simulation===
In [[simulation]], the dependent variable is changed in response to changes in the independent variables.

==Statistics synonyms==
Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a "predictor variable", '''regressor''', '''covariate''', "controlled variable", "manipulated variable", "explanatory variable", '''exposure variable''' (see [[reliability theory]]), "[[risk factor]]" (see [[medical statistics]]), "[[Feature (machine learning)|feature]]" (in [[machine learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]) or "input variable."&lt;ref name="Dodgeindepvar"&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for "independent variable")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodgeregression"&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for "regression")&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[econometrics]], the term "control variable" is usually used instead of "covariate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gujarati |first=Damodar N. |last2=Porter |first2=Dawn C. |title=Basic Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2009 |edition=Fifth international |isbn=978-007-127625-2 |chapter=Terminology and Notation |pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |year=2012 |title=Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach |location=Mason, OH |publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning |edition=Fifth |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a "response variable", "regressand", "criterion", "predicted variable", "measured variable", "explained variable", "experimental variable", "responding variable", "outcome variable", "output variable" or "label".&lt;ref name="Dodgeregression"/&gt;

"Explanatory variable"{{anchor|explanatory variable}} is preferred by some authors over "independent variable" when the quantities treated as independent variables may not be statistically independent or independently manipulable by the researcher.&lt;ref name="Everitt1"&gt;Everitt, B.S. (2002) Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge1"&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the independent variable is referred to as an "explanatory variable" then the term "response variable"{{anchor|response variable}} is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.&lt;ref name="Dodgeregression"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge1"/&gt;

"Explained variable"{{anchor|explained variable}} is preferred by some authors over "dependent variable" when the quantities treated as "dependent variables" may not be statistically dependent.&lt;ref name="DAUME"&gt;Ash Narayan Sah (2009) Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel, New Delhi. {{ISBN|978-81-7446-716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the dependent variable is referred to as an "explained variable" then the term "predictor variable"{{anchor|predictor variable}} is preferred by some authors for the independent variable.&lt;ref name="DAUME"/&gt;

Variables may also be referred to by their form: continuous, binary/dichotomous, nominal categorical, and ordinal categorical, among others.

An example is provided by the analysis of trend in sea level by {{Harvtxt|Woodworth|1987}}. Here the [[dependent variable]] (and variable of most interest) was the annual mean sea level at a given location for which a series of yearly values were available. The primary independent variable was time. Use was made of a covariate consisting of yearly values of annual mean atmospheric pressure at sea level. The results showed that inclusion of the covariate allowed improved estimates of the trend against time to be obtained, compared to analyses which omitted the covariate.

==Other variables==
A variable may be thought to alter the dependent or independent variables, but may not actually be the focus of the experiment. So that variable will be kept constant or monitored to try to minimize its effect on the experiment. Such variables may be designated as either a "controlled variable", "[[control variable]]", or "extraneous variable".

Extraneous variables, if included in a regression analysis as independent variables, may aid a researcher with accurate response parameter estimation, [[prediction]], and [[goodness of fit]], but are not of substantive interest to the [[hypothesis]] under examination. For example, in a study examining the effect of post-secondary education on lifetime earnings, some extraneous variables might be gender, ethnicity, social class, genetics, intelligence, age, and so forth. A variable is extraneous only when it can be assumed (or shown) to influence the [[dependent variable]]. If included in a regression, it can improve the fit of the model. If it is excluded from the regression and if it has a non-zero [[covariance]] with one or more of the independent variables of interest, its omission will [[bias (statistics)|bias]] the regression's result for the effect of that independent variable of interest. This effect is called [[confounding]] or [[omitted variable bias]]; in these situations, design changes and/or controlling for a variable statistical control is necessary.

Extraneous variables are often classified into three types:
#Subject variables, which are the characteristics of the individuals being studied that might affect their actions. These variables include age, gender, health status, mood, background, etc.
#Blocking variables or experimental variables are characteristics of the persons conducting the experiment which might influence how a person behaves. Gender, the presence of racial discrimination, language, or other factors may qualify as such variables.
#Situational variables are features of the environment in which the study or research was conducted, which have a bearing on the outcome of the experiment in a negative way. Included are the air temperature, level of activity, lighting, and the time of day.

In modelling, variability that is not covered by the independent variable is designated by &lt;math&gt;e_I&lt;/math&gt; and is known as the "[[errors and residuals|residual]]", "side effect", "[[errors and residuals|error]]", "unexplained share", "residual variable", or "tolerance".

==Examples==
* Effect of fertilizer on plant growth
: In a study measuring the influence of different quantities of fertilizer on plant growth, the independent variable would be the amount of fertilizer used. The dependent variable would be the growth in height or mass of the plant. The controlled variables would be the type of plant, the type of fertilizer, the amount of sunlight the plant gets, the size of the pots, etc.
* Effect of drug dosage on symptom severity
: In a study of how different doses of a drug affect the severity of symptoms, a researcher could compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms when different doses are administered. Here the independent variable is the dose and the dependent variable is the frequency/intensity of symptoms.
* Effect of temperature on pigmentation
: In measuring the amount of color removed from beetroot samples at different temperatures, temperature is the independent variable and amount of pigment removed is the dependent variable.

This is a summary of '''differentiation rules''', that is, rules for computing the [[derivative]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] in [[calculus]].

== Elementary rules of differentiation ==

Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of [[real number|real numbers ('''R''')]] that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are [[well defined]]&lt;ref&gt;''Calculus (5th edition)'', F. Ayres, E. Mendelson, Schaum's Outline Series, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-150861-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Calculus (3rd edition)'', R. Wrede, M.R. Spiegel, Schaum's Outline Series, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-07-162366-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—including [[complex number|complex numbers ('''C''')]].&lt;ref&gt;''Complex Variables'', M.R. Speigel, S. Lipschutz, J.J. Schiller, D. Spellman, Schaum's Outlines Series, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-161569-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differentiation is linear===
 
{{main|Linearity of differentiation}}

For any functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and any real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = a f'(x) + b g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Leibniz's notation]] this is written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(af+bg)}{dx}  = a\frac{df}{dx} +b\frac{dg}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases include:

* ''The [[Constant factor rule in differentiation|constant factor
 rule]]''
:&lt;math&gt;(af)' = af' &lt;/math&gt;
* ''The [[Sum rule in differentiation|sum rule]]''
:&lt;math&gt;(f + g)' = f' + g'&lt;/math&gt;
* ''The subtraction rule''
:&lt;math&gt;(f - g)' = f' - g'.&lt;/math&gt;

===The product rule===

{{main|Product rule}}

For the functions ''f'' and ''g'', the derivative of the function ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') ''g''(''x'')
with respect to ''x'' is
:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = (f(x) g(x))' = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;
In Leibniz's notation this is written
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(fg)}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx} g + f \frac{dg}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The chain rule===

{{main|Chain rule}}

The derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz's notation this is correctly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}h(x) = \frac{d}{dz}f(z)|_{z=g(x)}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}g(x),&lt;/math&gt; 

often abridged to &lt;math&gt;\quad\frac{dh(x)}{dx} = \frac{df(g(x))}{dg(x)}\cdot \frac{dg(x)}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;
Focusing on the notion of maps, and the differential being a map &lt;math&gt;\text{D}&lt;/math&gt;, this is written in a more concise way as:

:&lt;math&gt; [\text{D} (h\circ g)]_x = [\text{D} h]_{g(x)} \cdot [\text{D}g]_x\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===The inverse function rule===

{{main|inverse functions and differentiation}}

If the function ''f'' has an [[inverse function]] ''g'', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''g''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x''}} and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;g' = \frac{1}{f'\circ g}.&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz notation, this is written as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocals==
===The polynomial or elementary power rule===

{{main|Power rule}}

If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^r&lt;/math&gt;, for any real number &lt;math&gt;r \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = rx^{r-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases include:
* If ''f''(''x'') = ''x'', then ''f′''(''x'') = 1.  This special case may be generalized to:
*:''The derivative of an affine function is constant'': if ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'', then ''f′''(''x'') = ''a''.

Combining this rule with the linearity of the derivative and the addition rule permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.

===The reciprocal rule===

{{main|Reciprocal rule}}
The derivative of ''h''(''x'') = 1/''f''(''x'') for any (nonvanishing) function ''f'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = -\frac{f'(x)}{(f(x))^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz's notation, this is written

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(1/f)}{dx} = -\frac{1}{f^2}\frac{df}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reciprocal rule can be derived from the quotient rule.

===The quotient rule===
{{main|Quotient rule}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2}\quad&lt;/math&gt; wherever ''g'' is nonzero.
This can be derived from the product rule.

===Generalized power rule===

{{main|Power rule}}

The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the '''functional power rule''': for any functions ''f'' and ''g'',
:&lt;math&gt;(f^g)' = \left(e^{g\ln f}\right)' = f^g\left(f'{g \over f} + g'\ln f\right),\quad&lt;/math&gt;
wherever both sides are well defined.

Special cases:
* If ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f′''(''x'') = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;''a'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; when ''a'' is any non-zero real number and ''x'' is positive.
* The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where ''g''(''x'') = −1.

== Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions ==

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left(c^{ax}\right) = {c^{ax} \ln c \cdot a } ,\qquad c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
note that the equation above is true for all ''c'', but the derivative for c &lt; 0 yields a complex number.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{ax}\right) = ae^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \log_c x\right) = {1 \over x \ln c} , \qquad c &gt; 0, c \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;
the equation above is also true for all ''c'' but yields a complex number if c&lt;0.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \ln x\right)  = {1 \over x} ,\qquad x &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \ln |x|\right) = {1 \over x}.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^x \right) = x^x(1+\ln x).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( f(x)^{ g(x) } \right ) = g(x)f(x)^{g(x)-1} \frac{df}{dx} + f(x)^{g(x)}\ln{( f(x) )}\frac{dg}{dx}, \qquad \text{if }f(x) &gt; 0, \text{ and if } \frac{df}{dx} \text{ and } \frac{dg}{dx} \text{ exist.}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( f_{1}(x)^{f_{2}(x)^{\left ( ... \right )^{f_{n}(x)}}} \right ) = \left [\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial }{\partial x_{k}} \left( f_{1}(x_1)^{f_{2}(x_2)^{\left ( ... \right )^{f_{n}(x_n)}}} \right ) \right ] \biggr\vert_{x_1 = x_2 = ... =x_n = x}, \text{ if } f_{i&lt;n}(x) &gt; 0 \text{ and }&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{df_{i}}{dx} \text{ exists. }&lt;/math&gt;
===Logarithmic derivatives===

The [[logarithmic derivative]] is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the [[logarithm]] of a function (using the chain rule):
:&lt;math&gt; (\ln f)'= \frac{f'}{f} \quad&lt;/math&gt; wherever ''f'' is positive.

[[Logarithmic differentiation]] is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.
Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction, each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

== Derivatives of trigonometric functions ==
{{main|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}

|-
|&lt;math&gt; (\cos x)' = -\sin x &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (\arccos x)' = -{1 \over \sqrt{1 - x^2}} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; (\tan x)' = \sec^2 x = { 1 \over \cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (\arctan x)' = { 1 \over 1 + x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; (\sec x)' = \sec x \tan x &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{arcsec} x)' = { 1 \over |x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; (\csc x)' = -\csc x \cot x &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{arccsc} x)' = -{1 \over |x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} &lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{arccot} x)' = -{1 \over 1 + x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
It is common to additionally define an inverse tangent function with two arguments, &lt;math&gt;\arctan(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Its value lies in the range &lt;math&gt;[-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; and reflects the quadrant of the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.  For the first and fourth quadrant (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) one has &lt;math&gt;\arctan(y, x&gt;0) = \arctan(y/x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Its partial derivatives are
{| style="width:100%; background:transparent; margin-left:2em;"
|width=100%|&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \arctan(y,x)}{\partial y} = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \arctan(y,x)}{\partial x} = \frac{-y}{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Derivatives of hyperbolic functions==
{| style="width:100%; background:transparent; margin-left:2em;"
|width=50%|&lt;math&gt;( \sinh x )'= \cosh x = \frac{e^x +
 e^{-x}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|width=50%|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{arsinh}\,x)' = { 1 \over \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(\cosh x )'= \sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{arcosh}\,x)' = {\frac {1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(\tanh x )'= {\operatorname{sech}^2\,x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{artanh}\,x)' = { 1 \over 1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{sech}\,x)' = - \tanh x\,\operatorname{sech}\,x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{arsech}\,x)' = -{1 \over x\sqrt{1 - x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{csch}\,x)' = -\,\operatorname{coth}\,x\,\operatorname{csch}\,x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{arcsch}\,x)' = -{1 \over |x|\sqrt{1 + x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{coth}\,x )' =

 -\,\operatorname{csch}^2\,x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{arcoth}\,x)' = { 1 \over 1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Derivatives of special functions==
{| style="width:100%; background:transparent; margin-left:2em;"
|width=80%|
;[[Gamma function]] &lt;math&gt;\quad \Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty  t^{x-1} e^{-t}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma'(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} \ln t\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;\, = \Gamma(x) \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\ln\left(1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right) - \dfrac{1}{x + n}\right) - \dfrac{1}{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;\, = \Gamma(x) \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; being the [[digamma function]], expressed by the parenthesized expression to the right of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the line above.

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta'(x) = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\ln n}{n^x}
=-\frac{\ln 2}{2^x} - \frac{\ln 3}{3^x} - \frac{\ln 4}{4^x} - \cdots

|}

==Derivatives of integrals==

{{main|Differentiation under the integral sign}}

Suppose that it is required to differentiate with respect to ''x'' the function

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the functions &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\,f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous in both &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some region of the &lt;math&gt;(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; plane, including &lt;math&gt;a(x)\leq t\leq b(x),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the functions &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b(x)&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous and both have continuous derivatives for &lt;math&gt;x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for &lt;math&gt;\,x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; F'(x) = f(x,b(x))\,b'(x) - f(x,a(x))\,a'(x) + \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\, f(x,t)\; dt\,. &lt;/math&gt;

This formula is the general form of the [[Leibniz integral rule]] and can be derived using the 
[[fundamental theorem of calculus]].

==Derivatives to ''n''th order==
Some rules exist for computing the ''n''th derivative of functions, where ''n'' is a positive integer.  These include:

===Faà di Bruno's formula===
{{main|Faà di Bruno's formula}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are ''n'' times differentiable, then

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d^n}{d x^n} [f(g(x))]= n! \sum_{\{k_m\}}^{} f^{(r)}(g(x)) \prod_{m=1}^n \frac{1}{k_m!} \left(g^{(m)}(x) \right)^{k_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r = \sum_{m=1}^{n-1} k_m&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt; \{k_m\}&lt;/math&gt; consists of all non-negative integer solutions of the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1}^{n} m k_m = n&lt;/math&gt;.

===General Leibniz rule===
{{main|General Leibniz rule}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are ''n'' times differentiable, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^n}{dx^n}[f(x)g(x)] = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \frac{d^{n-k}}{d x^{n-k}} f(x) \frac{d^k}{d x^k} g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">In [[mathematics]], especially in applications of [[linear algebra]] to [[physics]], the '''Einstein notation''' or '''Einstein summation convention''' is a notational convention that implies summation over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving notational brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of [[Ricci calculus]]; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between [[Tangent space|tangent]] and [[cotangent space|cotangent]] spaces. It was introduced to physics by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |coauthors= |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=1916 |publisher= |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=[[PDF]] |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

===Statement of convention===

According to this convention, when an index variable appears twice in a single term and is not otherwise defined (see [[free and bound variables]]), it implies summation of that term over all the values of the index. So where the indices can range over the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},

:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{i = 1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

is simplified by the convention to:

:
&lt;math&gt;y = c_i x^i&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s. That is, in this context {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be understood as the second component of {{math|'''x'''}} rather than the square of {{math|'''x'''}} (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity).  The upper index position in {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;}} is because, typically, an index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term (see 'Application' below).  And typically {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} would be equivalent to the traditional {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}.

In [[general relativity]], a common convention is that 
*the [[Greek alphabet]] is used for space and time components, where indices take on values 0, 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''μ'', ''ν'', ...}}), 
*the [[Latin alphabet]] is used for spatial components only, where indices take on values 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''i'', ''j'', ...}}),

In general, indices can range over any [[Indexed family|indexing set]], including an [[infinite set]]. This should not be confused with a typographically similar convention used to distinguish between [[tensor index notation]] and the closely related but distinct basis-independent [[abstract index notation]].

An index that is summed over is a ''summation index'', in this case "{{math|''i''}}". It is also called a [[bound variable|dummy index]] since any symbol can replace "{{math|''i''}}" without changing the meaning of the expression provided that it does not collide with index symbols in the same term.

An index that is not summed over is a [[free variable|''free index'']] and should appear only once per term.  If such an index does appear, it usually also appears in terms belonging to the same sum, with the exception of special values such as zero.

===Application===

Einstein notation can be applied in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention can be applied more generally to any repeated indices within a term.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EinsteinSummation.html |title=Einstein Summation|accessdate=13 April 2011 |last= |first= |year= |work= |publisher=Wolfram Mathworld }}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant]] vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see ''{{section link||Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts}}'' below.

==Vector representations==

=== Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts ===

In terms of [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]], 
* upper indices represent components of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant vectors]] ([[coordinate vector|vector]]s), 
* lower indices represent components of [[covariant vector|covariant]] vectors ([[covector]]s).

They transform contravariantly or covariantly, respectively, with respect to change of basis.

In recognition of this fact, the following notation uses the same symbol both for a (co)vector and its ''components'', as in:
:&lt;math&gt;v = v^i e_i = \begin{bmatrix}e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; e_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ v^2 \\ \vdots \\ v^n\end{bmatrix} \qquad w = w_i e^i = \begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}e^1 \\ e^2 \\ \vdots \\ e^n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the vector and {{math|''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are its components (not the {{math|''i''}}th covector {{math|''v''}}), {{math|''w''}} is the covector and {{math|''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are its components.

In the presence of a non-degenerate form (an isomorphism {{math|''V'' → ''V''{{i sup|∗}}}}, for instance a [[Riemannian metric]] or [[Minkowski metric]]), one can [[raising and lowering indices|raise and lower indices]].

A basis gives such a form (via the [[dual basis]]), hence when working on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis, one has the option to work with only subscripts.

However, if one changes coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].

===Mnemonics===

In the above example, vectors are represented as {{math|''n'' × 1}} matrices (column vectors), while covectors are represented as {{math|1 × ''n''}} matrices (row covectors).

When using the column vector convention

* "'''Up'''per indices go '''up''' to down; '''l'''ower indices go '''l'''eft to right."
* "'''Co'''variant tensors are '''row''' vectors that have indices that are bel'''ow''' ('''co-below-row''')."
* Covectors are row vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_k\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the lower index indicates which ''column'' you are in.
* Contravariant vectors are column vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ \vdots \\ v^k\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the upper index indicates which ''row'' you are in.

=== Abstract description ===

The virtue of Einstein notation is that it represents the invariant quantities with a simple notation.

In physics, a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] is invariant under transformations of [[basis (mathematics)|basis]]. In particular, a [[Lorentz scalar]] is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual terms in the sum are not. When the basis is changed, the ''components'' of a vector change by a linear transformation described by a matrix. This led Einstein to propose the convention that repeated indices imply the summation is to be done.

As for covectors, they change by the inverse matrix. This is designed to guarantee that the linear function associated with the covector, the sum above, is the same no matter what the basis is.

The value of the Einstein convention is that it applies to other vector spaces built from {{math|''V''}} using the [[tensor product]] and [[dual space|duality]]. For example, {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}}, the tensor product of {{math|''V''}} with itself, has a basis consisting of tensors of the form {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Any tensor {{math|'''T'''}} in {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T^{ij}\mathbf{e}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{math|''V''*}}, the dual of {{math|''V''}}, has a basis {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt; which obeys the rule
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i (\mathbf{e}_j) = \delta^i_j.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]]. As

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(V,W) = V^* \otimes W&lt;/math&gt;
the row/column coordinates on a matrix correspond to the upper/lower indices on the tensor product.

== Common operations in this notation ==

In Einstein notation, the usual element reference {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for the {{math|''m''}}th row and {{math|''n''}}th column of matrix {{math|'''A'''}} becomes {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. We can then write the following operations in Einstein notation as follows.

;[[Inner product]] (hence also [[vector dot product]])

Using an [[orthogonal basis]], the inner product is the sum of corresponding components multiplied together:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This can also be calculated by multiplying the covector on the vector.

;[[Vector cross product]]

Again using an orthogonal basis (in 3 dimensions) the cross product intrinsically involves summations over permutations of components:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}= \varepsilon^i{}_{jk}u^j v^k \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^i{}_{jk}=\delta^{il}\varepsilon_{ljk}&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and {{math|''δ&lt;sup&gt;il&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the generalized [[Kronecker delta]]. Based on this definition of {{math|''ε''}}, there is no difference between {{math|''ε&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} but the position of indices.

;Matrix-Vector Multiplication

The product of a matrix {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with a column vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is :

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_{i} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v})_{i}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;u^i = A^i{}_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of matrix multiplication.

;[[Matrix multiplication]]

The [[Matrix multiplication#matrix product|matrix product]] of two matrices {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{ik} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B})_{ik}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} B_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;C^i{}_k = A^i{}_j B^j{}_k &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Trace (linear algebra)|Trace]]

For a square matrix {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, hence the sum over a common index {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

;[[Outer product]]

The outer product of the column vector {{math|''u&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} by the row vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} yields an {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|'''A'''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A^i{}_j = u^i v_j  = (u v)^i{}_j&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} represent two ''different'' indices, there is no summation and the indices are not eliminated by the multiplication.

;[[Raising and lowering indices]]

Given a tensor, one can raise an index or lower an index by contracting the tensor with the metric tensor, {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For example, take the tensor {{math|''T&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, one can raise an index:

&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\alpha} = g^{\mu\sigma} T_{\sigma}{}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Or one can lower an index:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\beta} = g_{\mu\sigma} T^{\sigma}{}_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

==Notes==

#{{note label|a}}This applies only for numerical indices. The situation is the opposite for [[abstract indices]]. Then, vectors themselves carry upper abstract indices and covectors carry lower abstract indices, as per the example in the [[#Introduction|introduction]] of this article. Elements of a basis of vectors may carry a lower ''numerical'' index and an upper ''abstract'' index.

'''Foundations of mathematics''' is the study of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] and logical&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369221/foundations-of-mathematics Joachim Lambek (2007), "Foundations of mathematics", ''Encyc. Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[Algorithm|algorithmic]] basis of [[mathematics]], or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/#MatLogFouMat Leon Horsten (2007, rev. 2012), "Philosophy of Mathematics" ''SEP'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and [[philosophy of mathematics]] turns out to be quite vague.
Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (set, function, geometrical figure, number, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the [[language of mathematics]] (formulas, theories and their [[model theory|models]] giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called [[metamathematics|metamathematical concepts]], with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.

The foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic.
Generally, the ''foundations'' of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part.

Mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.

The systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called [[mathematical logic]], with strong links to [[theoretical computer science]].
It went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components ([[set theory]], [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field.
Its high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.

== Historical context ==
{{See also|History of logic|History of mathematics}}

=== Ancient Greek mathematics ===
{{Further|Ancient Greek mathematics}}

While the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations, special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the Ancient Greeks.

Early Greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic, arithmetic or geometry.
[[Zeno of Elea]] (490{{snd}} c. 430&amp;nbsp;BC) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school of mathematics]] originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of {{radic|2}}, the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC), was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (408–355&amp;nbsp;BC), a student of [[Plato]], who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by [[Richard Dedekind]] (1831&amp;ndash;1916).

In the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) laid down the [[axiomatic method]] for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry.
This method reached its high point with [[Euclid]]'s [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']] (300&amp;nbsp;BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of [[syllogisms]] (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates).
Aristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's ''Elements'', are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece.

=== Platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics ===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
{{Further|Platonism (mathematics)}}

Starting from the end of the 19th century, a Platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians.

The ''concepts'' or, as Platonists would have it, the ''objects'' of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience: geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects, and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects. Their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges: How do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation? Are they located in their representation, or in our minds, or somewhere else? How can we know them?

The ancient Greek philosophers took such questions very seriously. Indeed, many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. [[Plato]] (424/423&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}} 348/347&amp;nbsp;BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic ''Ideas'' (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is ''discovered'' by humans. In the ''[[Meno]]'' Plato's teacher Socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.

Above the gateway to Plato's academy appeared a famous inscription: "Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here". In this way Plato indicated his high opinion of geometry. He regarded geometry as "the first essential in the training of philosophers", because of its abstract character.

This philosophy of ''[[Platonism (mathematics)|Platonist mathematical realism]]'' is shared by many mathematicians. It can be argued that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.&lt;ref name="Podnieks"&gt;Karlis Podnieks, [http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt1.html#BM1_1 Platonism, intuition and the nature of mathematics: 1. Platonism - the Philosophy of Working Mathematicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this view, the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status, and the [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|effectiveness]] ceases to be unreasonable. Not our axioms, but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation.

Aristotle dissected and rejected this view in his [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]. These questions provide much fuel for philosophical analysis and debate.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
For over 2,000 years, Euclid's Elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists well into the 19th century.

The Middle Ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals (platonic Ideas): [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] asserted their existence independently of perception; [[conceptualism]] asserted their existence within the mind only; [[nominalism]] denied either, only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects (following older speculations that they are words, "''logoi''").

[[René Descartes]] published ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (1637), aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) in England and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716) in Germany independently developed the [[infinitesimal calculus]] based on heuristic methods greatly efficient, but direly lacking rigorous justifications. Leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers (close to zero). Leibniz also worked on formal logic but most of his writings on it remained unpublished until 1903.

The Protestant philosopher [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), in his campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus:&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;''[[The Analyst]], A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; "They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?"

Then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications, but with little attention to logical foundations.

=== 19th century ===
In the [[History of mathematics#19th century|19th century]], mathematics became increasingly abstract. Concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems.

==== Real analysis ====
{{See also|Mathematical analysis#History}}

[[Cauchy]] (1789–1857) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the [[generality of algebra]] exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'' he defines [[infinitesimal|infinitely small quantities]] in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence.

The modern [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[continuous functions]] was first developed by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] in 1817, but remained relatively unknown. It gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers, arguably resolving the Zeno paradoxes and Berkeley's arguments.

Mathematicians such as [[Karl Weierstrass]] (1815–1897) discovered pathological functions such as [[Weierstrass function|continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions]]. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate. Weierstrass began to advocate the [[arithmetization of analysis]], to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers.

In 1858, [[Dedekind]] proposed a definition of the real numbers as [[Dedekind cuts|cuts]] of rational numbers. This reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers, and thus of natural numbers, was later integrated by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in his set theory, and axiomatized in terms of [[second order arithmetic]] by Hilbert and Bernays.

==== Group theory ====
{{See also|History of group theory}}

For the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]] (1802–1829), a Norwegian, and [[Évariste Galois]], (1811–1832) a Frenchman, investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations, and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). With these concepts, [[Pierre Wantzel]] (1837) proved that straightedge and compass alone cannot [[trisect an arbitrary angle]] nor [[Doubling the cube|double a cube]]. In 1882, [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] building on the work of [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] showed that a straightedge and compass [[quadrature of the circle]] (construction of a square equal in area to a given circle) was also impossible by proving that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] is a [[transcendental number]]. Mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient Greeks.

Abel and Galois's works opened the way for the developments of [[group theory]] (which would later be used to study [[symmetry]] in physics and other fields), and [[abstract algebra]]. Concepts of [[vector spaces]] emerged from the conception of [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827, to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by Peano in 1888. Geometry was no more limited to three dimensions.
These concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized, breaking away from familiar mathematical objects.

==== Non-Euclidean geometries ====
{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History}}

After many failed attempts to derive the [[parallel postulate]] from other axioms, the study of the still hypothetical [[hyperbolic geometry]] by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] (1728–1777) led him to introduce the [[hyperbolic functions]] and compute the area of a [[hyperbolic triangle]] (where the sum of angles is less than 180°). Then the Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] (1792–1856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the [[parallel postulate]]), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]] (1802–1860) in 1832, and with [[Gauss]].
Later in the 19th century, the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed [[Elliptic geometry]], another [[non-Euclidean geometry]] where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180°. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a [[great circle]] on the sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] for it.

==== Projective geometry ====
One of the traps in a [[deductive system]] is [[circular reasoning]], a problem that seemed to befall [[projective geometry]] until it was resolved by [[Karl von Staudt]]. As explained by Russian historians:&lt;ref&gt;Laptev, B.L. &amp; B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) ''Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry'', page 40, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Birkhäuser]] {{ISBN|3-7643-5048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the mid-nineteenth century there was an acrimonious controversy between the proponents of synthetic and analytic methods in projective geometry, the two sides accusing each other of mixing projective and metric concepts. Indeed the basic concept that is applied in the synthetic presentation of projective geometry, the [[cross-ratio]] of four points of a line, was introduced through consideration of the lengths of intervals.}}

The purely geometric approach of von Staudt was based on the [[complete quadrilateral]] to express the relation of [[projective harmonic conjugate]]s. Then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his [[Karl von Staudt#Algebra of throws|Algebra of Throws]]. English language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] can be found in either the book by [[Oswald Veblen]] and John Young, ''Projective Geometry'' (1938), or more recently in [[John Stillwell]]'s ''Four Pillars of Geometry'' (2005). Stillwell writes on page 120

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;projective geometry is ''simpler'' than algebra in a certain sense, because we use only five geometric axioms to derive the nine field axioms.}}

The algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon [[number]]s without worry about their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 [[Coxeter]] wrote ''Introduction to Geometry'' without mention of cross-ratio.

==== Boolean algebra and logic ====
Attempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with Leibniz and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Lambert]] (1728–1777), and continued with works by algebraists such as [[George Peacock]] (1791–1858).
Systematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the British mathematician [[George Boole]] (1847) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations (conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers. Additionally, [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] published his [[De Morgan's laws|laws]] in 1847. Logic thus became a branch of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in [[computer science]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for [[Relation (logic)|relations]] and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.

The German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his [[Begriffsschrift]] (formula language) published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. He exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's ''Logic'', and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory:

# [[Consistency]]: impossibility of proving contradictory statements.
# [[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]: any statement is either provable or refutable (i.e. its negation is provable).
# [[Decidability (logic)|Decidability]]: there is a decision procedure to test any statement in the theory.

He then showed in ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic)'' how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic.

Frege's work was popularized by [[Bertrand Russell]] near the turn of the century. But Frege's two-dimensional notation had no success. Popular notations were (x) for universal and (∃x) for existential quantifiers, coming from [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[William Ernest Johnson]] until the ∀ symbol was introduced by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s.

From 1890 to 1905, [[Ernst Schröder]] published ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik'' in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to [[Mathematical_logic#Symbolic_logic|symbolic logic]] as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.

==== Peano arithmetic ====
{{Main|Peano arithmetic}}

The formalization of [[arithmetic]] (the theory of [[natural numbers]]) as an axiomatic theory started with Peirce in 1881 and continued with Richard Dedekind and [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888. This was still a [[Second-order logic|second-order]] axiomatization (expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets, thus with an implicit use of [[set theory]]) as concerns for expressing theories in [[first-order logic]] were not yet understood. In Dedekind's work, this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the [[successor function]] and [[mathematical induction]].

== Foundational crisis&lt;!-- 'Foundational crisis of mathematics' redirects here --&gt; ==
The '''foundational crisis of mathematics'''&lt;!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --&gt; (in [[German language|German]] ''Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik'') was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.

Several schools of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be [[consistent]]ly stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various [[paradox]]es (such as [[Russell's paradox]]).

The name ''"paradox"'' should not be confused with ''contradiction''. A [[contradiction]] in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory (such as {{math|1=2 + 2 = 5}}), showing that this theory is [[inconsistent]] and must be rejected. But a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory, or an informal argument leading to a contradiction, so that a candidate theory, if it is to be formalized, must disallow at least one of its steps; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction. Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as "there is no set of all sets" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories).

Various schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] approach, of which [[David Hilbert]] was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as [[Hilbert's program]], which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] [[Finitism|finitistic]] means. The main opponent was the [[intuitionism|intuitionist]] school, led by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols (van Dalen, 2008). The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', the leading mathematical journal of the time.

=== Philosophical views ===
{{Main|Philosophy of mathematics}}

At the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: Formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism.

==== Formalism ====
{{Main|Formalism (mathematics)}}

It has been claimed that formalists, such as [[David Hilbert]] (1862&amp;ndash;1943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Indeed, he used the words "formula game" in his 1927 response to [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]'s criticisms:

{{quote|And to what extent has the formula game thus made possible been successful? This formula game enables us to express the entire thought-content of the science of mathematics in a uniform manner and develop it in such a way that, at the same time, the interconnections between the individual propositions and facts become clear ... The formula game that Brouwer so deprecates has, besides its mathematical value, an important general philosophical significance. For this formula game is carried out according to certain definite rules, in which the ''technique of our thinking'' is expressed. These rules form a closed system that can be discovered and definitively stated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hilbert 1927 ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' in van Heijenoort 1967:475&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an ''arbitrary'' game with ''arbitrary'' rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

{{quote|We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;p. 14 in Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel, Birkhauser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by [[David Hilbert]], is a response to the paradoxes of [[set theory]], and is based on [[formal logic]]. Virtually all mathematical [[theorem]]s today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|axioms of set theory]] using the rules of formal logic.

Merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do "true" mathematical statements (e.g., the [[Peano axioms|laws of arithmetic]]) appear to be true, and so on. [[Hermann Weyl]] would ask these very questions of Hilbert:

{{quote|What "truth" or objectivity can be ascribed to this theoretic construction of the world, which presses far beyond the given, is a profound philosophical problem. It is closely connected with the further question: what impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert? Consistency is indeed a necessary but not a sufficient condition. For the time being we probably cannot answer this question ...&lt;ref&gt;Weyl 1927 ''Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics'' in van Heijenoort 1967:484. Although Weyl the intuitionist believed that "Hilbert's view" would ultimately prevail, this would come with a significant loss to philosophy: "''I see in this a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology'', which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence{{snd}} mathematics" (ibid).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as [[reverse mathematics]] and [[computational complexity theory]]. As noted by Weyl, [[formal logical system]]s also run the risk of [[consistency proof|inconsistency]]; in [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of [[consistency proof|consistency]], but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently [[finitism|finitary]] to be meaningful. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own [[consistency proof|consistency]]. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system ''S'' was consistent, based on principles ''P'' that only made up a small part of ''S''. But Gödel proved that the principles ''P'' could not even prove ''P'' to be consistent, let alone ''S''.

==== Intuitionism ====
{{Main|Intuitionism|Constructivism (mathematics)}}

Intuitionists, such as [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.

The foundational philosophy of ''[[intuitionism]]'' or ''[[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]]'', as exemplified in the extreme by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and [[Stephen Kleene]], requires proofs to be "constructive" in nature{{snd}} the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as [[reductio ad absurdum]] is suspect.

Some modern [[theory|theories]] in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense.  Some theories tend to focus on [[mathematical practice]], and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a [[social group]]. Others try to create a [[cognitive science of mathematics]], focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.

==== Logicism ====
{{Main|Logicism}}

[[Logicism]] is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature . [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] championed this theory initiated by [[Gottlob Frege]] and influenced by [[Richard Dedekind]]

==== Set-theoretic Platonism ====
{{main|Set-theoretic Platonism}}
Many researchers in [[axiomatic set theory]] have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic [[Platonism#Modern Platonism|Platonism]], exemplified by [[Kurt Gödel]].

Several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the [[continuum hypothesis]]. Many [[large cardinal]] axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by [[Joel David Hamkins|Hamkins]] proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic [[multiverse]] allowing free passage between set-theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.

==== Indispensability argument for realism ====
This [[Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis|argument]] by [[Willard Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] says (in Putnam's shorter words),

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;quantification over mathematical entities is [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|indispensable for science]]&amp;nbsp;...; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question.}}

However Putnam was not a Platonist.

==== Rough-and-ready realism ====
Few mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as insured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. 

Such a view was has also been expressed by some well-known physicists.

For example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Richard Feynman]] said

{{quote|People say to me, "Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?" No, I'm not ... If it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it&amp;nbsp;– that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it's like an onion with millions of layers ... then that's the way it is. But either way there's Nature and she's going to come out the way She is. So therefore when we go to investigate we shouldn't predecide what it is we're looking for only to find out more about it.&lt;ref name="fey1"&gt;Richard Feynman, ''The Pleasure of Finding Things Out'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And [[Steven Weinberg]]:&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;Steven Weinberg, chapter ''[http://libcom.org/library/unexpected-uselessness-philosophy Against Philosophy]'' wrote, in ''Dreams of a final theory&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The insights of philosophers have occasionally benefited physicists, but generally in a negative fashion – by protecting them from the preconceptions of other philosophers. ... without some guidance from our preconceptions one could do nothing at all. It is just that philosophical principles have not generally provided us with the right preconceptions.}}

Weinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.

==== Philosophical consequences of Gödel's completeness theorem ====
{{Main|Gödel's completeness theorem}}

Gödel's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first-order theory it gives an "explicit construction" of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this "explicit construction" is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable).

This can be seen as a giving a sort of justification to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real. More precisely, it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality (an actual infinity) suffices to imply the existence of a model (a world of objects) of any consistent theory. However several difficulties remain:

* For any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects, but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them.
* In the case of set theory, none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model, as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities. Similar remarks can be made in many other cases. For example, with theories that include arithmetic, such constructions generally give models that include non-standard numbers, unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them.
* As it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction, it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent, but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds. It gives no indication on which axiomatic system should be preferred as a foundation of mathematics.
* As claims of consistency are usually unprovable, they remain a matter of belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications. Hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions: the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory.

Another consequence of the completeness theorem is that it justifies the conception of infinitesimals as actual infinitely small nonzero quantities, based on the existence of non-standard models as equally legitimate to standard ones. This idea was formalized by [[Abraham Robinson]] into the theory of [[nonstandard analysis]].

=== More paradoxes ===
{{See also|List of statements independent of ZFC|List of paradoxes}}

*1920: [[Thoralf Skolem]] corrected [[Leopold Löwenheim]]'s proof of what is now called the [[downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], leading to [[Skolem's paradox]] discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property.
*1922: Proof by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] that the [[axiom of choice]] cannot be proved from the axioms of [[Zermelo set theory]] with [[urelement]]s.
*1931: Publication of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], showing that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system{{snd}} such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of [[arithmetic]] on the (infinite) set of natural numbers{{snd}} a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely [[formal system]] as envisaged in Hilbert's program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the "finitistic" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a 'weaker' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove).
*1936: [[Alfred Tarski]] proved his [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|truth undefinability theorem]].
*1936: [[Alan Turing]] proved that a general algorithm to solve the [[halting problem]] for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.
*1938: Gödel proved the [[Constructible universe|consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis]].
*1936–1937: [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only [[semi-decidable]] as given by the [[completeness theorem]]).
*1955: [[Pyotr Novikov]] showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable.
*1963: [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. Cohen's proof developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which is now an important tool for establishing [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] results in set theory.
*1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, [[Gregory Chaitin]] starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |accessdate=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without [[urelements]].
*1970: [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a [[Diophantine equation]] (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.
*1971: [[Suslin's problem]] is proven to be independent from ZFC.

== Partial resolution of the crisis ==
Starting in 1935, the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory.

The intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]]'s work in 1967 that [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]] was placed on a sounder footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Five stages of accepting constructive mathematics | author = Andrej Bauer | journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 54 | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1090/bull/1556 | page = 485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One may consider that [[Hilbert's program#Hilbert's program after Gödel|Hilbert's program has been partially completed]], so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert's original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all.

There are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we don't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF.

In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of [[ZFC]], generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.

The development of [[category theory]] in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck Universes is formally eliminable.

One goal of the [[Reverse Mathematics]] program is to identify whether there are areas of 'core mathematics' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Ganita-yukti-bhasa''' (also written as '''Ganita Yuktibhasa''') is either the title or a part of the title of three different books:

The book is published in two volumes as Volume I and Volume II. Jyeshthadeva's Yuktibhasa discusses various topics in mathematics and astronomy and it is purported to be an enunciation of the rationales underlying the various mathematical assertions and the astronomical concepts and computations in the great treatise [[Tantrasamgraha]] of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544). (An edition of the mathematical portion of [[Yuktibhasa]] with some explanatory notes in [[Malayalam]] had appeared in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Yuktibhâsâ, Part I'' (ed) with notes by Ramavarma (Maru) Thampuran and A. R. Akhileswara Aiyer, Magalodayam Ltd., [[Trichur]], [[Kerala]],  1123 [[Malayalam Era]], 1948 [[BCE|CE]].&lt;/ref&gt;)
*In addition to Jyshthadeva's Yuktibhasa, [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] had produced another work called '''Ganita Yuktibhasa'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K.V. Sarma|author2=S.

The date of composition and the name of the author of this work in [[Sanskrit]] have not been determined with certainty. The book appears to be of a later period and seems to have been  composed as a somewhat rough Sanskrit translation of the Malayalam original [[Yuktibhasa]].

==More on ''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva''==

This edition of [[Yuktibhasa]] has been divided into two volumes, even though the original [[Malayalam]] text has no such division. Volume I deals with  mathematics and Volume II treats astronomy. Each volume is divided into three parts: First part is an [[English language|English]] translation of the relevant [[Malayalam]] part of [[Yuktibhasa]], second part contains  detailed explanatory notes on the translation,  and in the third part the text in the [[Malayalam]] original is reproduced. The [[English language|English]] translation is by [[K.V. Sarma]] and the explanatory notes are provided by Ramasubramanian, K., Srinivas, M.D. and Sriram, M.S..

Volume I dealing with mathematics is divided into seven chapters. The topics discussed are the eight mathematical operations, a certain set of ten problems, arithmetic of fractions, rule of three, [[Kuṭṭaka|Kuttakara]] (linear indeterminate equations), infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle and infinite series and approximations for sines.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"&gt;For more details on contents see Kinokuniya DataBase: {{cite web|url=http://bookwebpro.kinokuniya.co.jp/booksea.cgi?ISBN=1848820720http://www.buscalibros.cl/libro.php?libro=2104208|title=Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II dealing with astronomy is divided into eight chapters. The topics covered are computation of mean and true longitudes of planets, Earth and celestial spheres, fifteen problems relating to ascension, declination, longitude, etc.,  determination of time, place, direction, etc., from gnomonic shadow, eclipses, Vyatipata (when the sun and moon have the same declination), visibility correction for planets  and phases of the moon.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"/&gt;

'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is credited with an 1820 proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J. Madeleine|last2=Nash |first3=Richard|last3=Woodbury |title=Space: Onward to Mars|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967915,00.html|date=July 18, 1988|page=50|subscription=yes|volume=132|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings in the form of drawing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth, intended as a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33681">{{Greek Alphabet}}

[[Greek letters]] are used in [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and other areas where mathematical notation is used as symbols for [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s, [[special function]]s, and also conventionally for [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing certain quantities. In these contexts, the capital letters and the small letters represent distinct and unrelated entities. Those Greek letters which have the same form as [[Latin letters]] are rarely used: capital A, B, E, Z, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, T, Y, X. Small ι, ο and υ are also rarely used, since they closely resemble the Latin letters i, o and u. Sometimes font variants of Greek letters are used as distinct symbols in mathematics, in particular for ε/ϵ and π/ϖ. The archaic letter [[digamma]] (Ϝ/ϝ/ϛ) is sometimes used.

The [[Bayer designation]] naming scheme for [[star]]s typically uses the first Greek letter, α, for the brightest star in each constellation, and runs through the alphabet before switching to Latin letters.

In [[mathematical finance]], [[Greeks (finance)|the Greeks]] are the variables denoted by Greek letters used to describe the risk of certain investments.

==Typography==

The Greek letter forms used in mathematics are often different from those used in [[Greek language|Greek-language]] text: they are designed to be used in isolation, not connected to other letters, and some use variant forms which are not normally used in current Greek typography.

The [[OpenType]] font format has the feature tag 'mgrk' "Mathematical Greek" to identify a [[glyph]] as representing a Greek letter to be used in mathematical (as opposed to Greek language) contexts.

The table below shows a comparison of Greek letters rendered in [[TeX]] and HTML.
The font used in the TeX rendering is an italic style. This is in line with the convention that variables should be italicized. As Greek letters are more often than not used as variables in mathematical formulas, a Greek letter appearing similar to the TeX rendering is more likely to be encountered in works involving mathematics.

==Geometry and infinite zeros==

===Grandi===
[[Guido Grandi]] (1671–1742) reportedly provided a simplistic account of the series in 1703. He noticed that inserting parentheses into {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} produced varying results: either
:&lt;math&gt;(1-1) + (1-1) + \cdots = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;1+(-1+1)+(-1+1) +\cdots = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Grandi's explanation of this phenomenon became well known for its religious overtones:

{{quote|text=By putting parentheses into the expression 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · in different ways, I can, if I want, obtain 0 or 1. But then the idea of the creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' is perfectly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Bagni ''Appunti'' ch.4, p.54. The original quotation, in Italian: "Mettendo in modo diverso le parentesi nell’espressione 1-1+1-1+... io posso, volendo, ottenere 0 o 1. Ma allora l’idea della creazione ''ex nihilo'' è perfettamente plausibile." Bagni does not identify the primary source, writing only that the quotation is from 1703 and that it is cited in I, p.185 of Silov, G.E. (1978), ''Analisi matematica'', Mir, Mosca. 1703 is also the publication year of the ''Quadratura circula'', but Panza's analysis of the treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · in that book does not mention this idea.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In fact, the series was not an idle subject for Grandi, and he didn't think it summed to either 0 or 1. Rather, like many mathematicians to follow, he thought the true value of the series was &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for a variety of reasons.

[[File:Witch (1, .5).svg|thumb|(1, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the witch of Agnesi]]
Grandi's mathematical treatment of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} occurs in his 1703 book ''Quadratura circula et hyperbolae per infinitas hyperbolas geometrice exhibita''. Broadly interpreting Grandi's work, he derived {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} through geometric reasoning connected with his investigation of the [[witch of Agnesi]]. Eighteenth-century mathematicians immediately translated and summarized his argument in analytical terms: for a generating circle with diameter ''a'', the equation of the witch ''y'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) has the series expansion
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{a^{2n-1}}=a - \frac{x^2}{a} + \frac{x^4}{a^3} - \frac{x^6}{a^5} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:and setting ''a'' = ''x'' = 1, one has 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;According to Giovanni Ferraro (2002 p.193), citing Marco Panza's doctoral dissertation including a detailed analysis of Grandi's writing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[Morris Kline]], Grandi started with the [[binomial expansion]]
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:and substituted ''x'' = 1 to get {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Grandi "also argued that since the sum was both 0 and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, he had proved that the world could be created out of nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1983 p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandi offered a new explanation that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in 1710, both in the second edition of the ''Quadratura circula''&lt;ref&gt;Panza (p.298) places the example on p.30 of Grandi 1710, ''Quadratura circula … editio altera''&lt;/ref&gt; and in a new work, ''De Infinitis infinitorum, et infinite parvorum ordinibus disquisitio geometrica''.&lt;ref&gt;Reiff pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Two brothers inherit a priceless gem from their father, whose will forbids them to sell it, so they agree that it will reside in each other's museums on alternating years. If this agreement lasts for all eternity between the brother's descendants, then the two families will each have half possession of the gem, even though it changes hands infinitely often. This argument was later criticized by Leibniz.&lt;ref name="Leibniz p.46"&gt;Leibniz (Gerhardt) pp.385-386, Markushevich p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable of the gem is the first of two additions to the discussion of the corollary that Grandi added to the second edition. The second repeats the link between the series and the creation of the universe by God:
{{quote|text=Sed inquies: aggregatum ex infinitis differentiis infinitarum ipsi DV æqualium, sive continuè, sive alternè sumptarum, est demum summa ex infinitis nullitatibus, seu 0, quomodo ergo quantitatem notabilem aggreget? At repono, eam Infiniti vim agnoscendam, ut etiam quod per se nullum est multiplicando, in aliquid commutet, sicuti finitam magnitudiné dividendo, in nullam degenerare cogit: unde per infinitam Dei Creatoris potentiam omnia ex nihlo facta, omniaque in nihilum redigi posse: neque adeò absurdum esse, quantitatem aliquam, ut ita dicam, creari per infinitam vel multiplicationem, vel additionem ipsius nihili, aut quodvis quantum infinita divisione, aut subductione in nihilum redigit.&lt;ref&gt;Panza (p.298) places this passage on p.29 of Grandi 1710, ''Quadratura circula … editio altera''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Marchetti===
After Grandi published the second edition of the ''Quadratura'', his fellow countryman [[Alessandro Marchetti (mathematician)|Alessandro Marchetti]] became one of his first critics. One historian charges that Marchetti was motivated more by jealousy than any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;Montucla pp.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Marchetti found the claim that an infinite number of zeros could add up to a finite quantity absurd, and he inferred from Grandi's treatment the danger posed by theological reasoning. The two mathematicians began attacking each other in a series of open letters; their debate was ended only by Marchetti's death in 1714.

==Leibniz==
With the help and encouragement of [[Antonio Magliabechi]], Grandi sent a copy of the 1703 ''Quadratura'' to Leibniz, along with a letter expressing compliments and admiration for the master's work. Leibniz received and read this first edition in 1705, and he called it an unoriginal and less-advanced "attempt" at his calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzone and Roero pp.246-247, who cite: Grandi to Magliabechi, Pisa 17.7.1703 BU Pisa MS 99, f. 219; Magliabechi to Grandi, Florence 31.7.1703, BU Pisa MS 93, f. 110; Grandi to Leibniz, Pisa 28.6.1703, GM 4, p. 209; Leibniz to Magliabechi, Hanover 12.8.1704; Leibniz to Magliabechi, Hanover 2.7.1705, Paoli 1899, p. XC; Leibniz to Grandi, Hanover 11.7.1705, GM 4, pp.210-212; Leibniz to Hermann, Hanover 21.5.1706, GM 4, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Grandi's treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · would not catch Leibniz's attention until 1711, near the end of his life, when [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] sent him a letter on Marchetti's behalf describing the problem and asking for Leibniz's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt p.141; Wolff to Leibniz, 16 April 1711, in Gerhardt pp.134-135, LXIII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
As early as 1674, in a minor, lesser-known writing ''De Triangulo Harmonico'' on the [[harmonic triangle]], Leibniz  mentioned {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} very briefly in an example:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = \frac11-\frac{1}{1+1}. \;\mathrm{Ergo}\; \frac{1}{1+1} = 1-1+1-1+1-1 \;\mathrm{etc.}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz p.369&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably he arrived at this series by repeated substitution:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} ) ) )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} ) ) ) ) )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;br/&gt;And so on.

The series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} also appears indirectly in a discussion with [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus|Tschirnhaus]] in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz p.817&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had already considered the divergent alternating series {{nowrap|1=[[1 − 2 + 4 − 8 + 16 − · · ·]]}} as early as 1673. In that case he argued that by subtracting either on the left or on the right, one could produce either positive or negative infinity, and therefore both answers are wrong and the whole should be finite. Two years after that, Leibniz formulated the first convergence test in the history of mathematics, the [[alternating series test]], in which he implicitly applied the modern definition of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz pp.205-207; Knobloch pp.124-127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solutions===
[[File:Leibniz to Wolff on Grandi.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the published Leibniz-Wolff letter]]
In the 1710s, Leibniz described Grandi's series in his correspondence with several other mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;For example, his ultimate solution is repeated in a 1716 letter to [[Pierre Dangicourt]]; see Hitt p.143&lt;/ref&gt; The letter with the most lasting impact was his first reply to Wolff, which he published in the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. In this letter, Leibniz attacked the problem from several angles.

In general, Leibniz believed that the algorithms of calculus were a form of "blind reasoning" that ultimately had to be founded upon geometrical interpretations. Therefore, he agreed with Grandi that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} claiming that the relation was well-founded because there existed a geometric demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 2000 p.545&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Leibniz sharply criticized Grandi's example of the shared gem, claiming that the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} has no relation to the story. He pointed out that for any finite, even number of years, the brothers have equal possession, yet the sum of the corresponding terms of the series is zero.&lt;ref name="Leibniz p.46"/&gt;

Leibniz thought that the argument from {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''x'')}} was valid; he took it as an example of his [[law of continuity]]. Since the relation {{nowrap|1=1 − ''x'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + · · · = 1/(1 + ''x'')}} holds for all ''x'' less than 1, it should hold for ''x'' equal to 1 as well. Still, Leibniz thought that one should be able to find the sum of the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} directly, without needing to refer back to the expression {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''x'')}} from which it came. This approach may seem obvious by modern standards, but it is a significant step from the point of view of the history of summing divergent series.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Weidlich (p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, the study of series was dominated by power series, and summing a numerical series by expressing it as ''f''(1) of some function's power series was thought to be the most natural strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro and Panza p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz begins by observing that taking an even number of terms from the series, the last term is −1 and the sum is 0:
:1 − 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 = 0.
Taking an odd number of terms, the last term is +1 and the sum is 1:
:1 = 1 − 1 + 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 = 1.

Now, the infinite series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · has neither an even nor an odd number of terms, so it produces neither 0 nor 1; by taking the series out to infinity, it becomes something between those two options. There is no more reason why the series should take one value than the other, so the theory of "probability" and the "law of justice" dictate that one should take the arithmetic mean of 0 and 1, which is {{nowrap|1=(0 + 1) / 2 = 1/2.}}&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz (Gerhardt) pp.386-387; Hitt (p.143) translates the Latin into French.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eli Maor]] says of this solution, "Such a brazen, careless reasoning indeed seems incredible to us today…"&lt;ref&gt;Maor, pp.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Kline portrays Leibniz as more self-conscious: "Leibniz conceded that his argument was more metaphysical than mathematical, but said that there is more metaphysical truth in mathematics than is generally recognized."&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1983 pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Further: Moore p.4--&gt;

Charles Moore muses that Leibniz would hardly have had such confidence in his metaphysical strategy if it did not give the same result (namely &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moore p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, this was no accident: Leibniz's treatment would be partially justified when the compatibility of averaging techniques and power series was finally proven in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Smail p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
When he had first raised the question of Grandi's series to Leibniz, Wolff was inclined toward skepticism along with Marchetti. Upon reading Leibniz's reply in mid-1712,&lt;ref&gt;Wolff's first reference to the letter published in the ''Acta Eruditorum'' appears in a letter written from [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] dated 12 June 1712; Gerhardt pp.143-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff was so pleased with the solution that he sought to extend the arithmetic mean method to more divergent series such as {{nowrap|1=1 − 2 + 4 − 8 + 16 − · · ·}}. Leibniz's intuition prevented him from straining his solution this far, and he wrote back that Wolff's idea was interesting but invalid for several reasons. For one, the terms of a summable series should decrease to zero; even {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} could be expressed as a limit of such series.&lt;ref&gt;Moore's pp.2-3; Leibniz's letter is in Gerhardt pp.147-148, dated 13 July 1712 from [[Hanover]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz described Grandi's series along with the general problem of convergence and divergence in letters to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in 1712 and early 1713. J. Dutka suggests that this correspondence, along with Nicolaus I Bernoulli's interest in probability, motivated him to formulate the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], another situation involving a divergent series, in September 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Dutka p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in his ''Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilités'', Grandi's series was connected with Leibniz seeing "an image of the Creation in his binary arithmetic", and thus Leibniz wrote a letter to [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] [[Claudio Filippo Grimaldi]], court mathematician in [[China]], in the hope that [[Claudio Filippo Grimaldi]]'s interest in science and the mathematical "emblem of creation" might combine to convert the nation to [[Christianity]]. Laplace remarks, "I record this anecdote only to show how far the prejudices of infancy may mislead the greatest men."&lt;ref&gt;Upham and Stewart pp.479, 480, who cite Laplace pp.194, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergence==

===Jacob Bernoulli===
[[File:Bernoulli Positiones 3 Opera.png|thumb|right|Start of ''Positiones'' part 3, as reprinted in 1744]]
[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1654–1705) dealt with a similar series in 1696 in the third part of his ''Positiones arithmeticae de seriebus infinitis''.&lt;ref name=Knopp457 /&gt; Applying [[Nicholas Mercator]]'s method for [[polynomial long division]] to the ratio {{nowrap|1=''k''/(''m'' + ''n'')}}, he noticed that one always had a remainder.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 2002 p.181&lt;/ref&gt; If {{nowrap|1=''m'' &gt; ''n''}} then this remainder decreases and "finally is less than any given quantity", and one has
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m+n}=\frac{k}{m} - \frac{kn}{m^2} + \frac{kn^2}{m^3} - \frac{kn^3}{m^4} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''m'' = ''n'', then this equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{2m}=\frac{k}{m} - \frac{k}{m} + \frac{k}{m} - \frac{k}{m} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
Bernoulli called this equation a "not inelegant paradox".&lt;ref name=Knopp457&gt;Knopp p.457&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor (p.96) makes the quote "''unde paradoxum fluit non inelegans''", citing Ebenda II, 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varignon===
[[File:Varignon Précautions.png|thumb|left]]
[[Pierre Varignon]] (1654–1722) treated Grandi's series in his report ''Précautions à prendre dans l'usage des Suites ou Series infinies résultantes…''. The first of his purposes for this paper was to point out the divergence of Grandi's series and expand on Jacob Bernoulli's 1696 treatment.

(Varignon's math…)

The final version of Varignon's paper is dated February 16, 1715, and it appeared in a volume of the ''Mémories'' of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that was itself not published until 1718. For such a relatively late treatment of Grandi's series, it is surprising that Varignon's report does not even mention Leibniz's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;For the possible significance of the omission, see Panza p.339.&lt;/ref&gt; But most of the ''Précautions'' was written in October 1712, while Varignon was away from [[Paris]]. The [[Abbé Poignard]]'s 1704 book on [[magic squares]], ''Traité des Quarrés sublimes'', had become a popular subject around the Academy, and the second revised and expanded edition weighed in at 336 pages. To make the time to read the ''Traité'', Varignon had to escape to the countryside for nearly two months, where he wrote on the topic of Grandi's series in relative isolation. Upon returning to Paris and checking in at the Academy, Varignon soon discovered that the great Leibniz had ruled in favor of Grandi. Having been separated from his sources, Varignon still had to revise his paper by looking up and including the citation to Jacob Bernoulli. Rather than also take Leibniz's work into account, Varignon explains in a postscript to his report that the citation was the only revision he had made in Paris, and that ''if'' other research on the topic arose, his thoughts on it would have to wait for a future report.&lt;ref&gt;Panza p.339; Varignon pp.203, 225; Gerhardt p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

(Letters between Varignon and Leibniz…)

In the 1751 ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] echoes the view that Grandi's reasoning based on division had been refuted by Varignon in 1715. (Actually, d'Alembert attributes the problem to "[[Luigi Guido Grandi|Guido Ubaldus]]", an error that is still occasionally propagated today.)&lt;ref&gt;Hitt pp.147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riccati and Bougainville===
In a 1715 letter to [[Jacopo Riccati]], Leibniz mentioned the question of Grandi's series and advertised his own solution in the ''Acta Eruditorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Bagni (p.4) identifies the letter as "probably written in 1715", citing Michieli's 1943 ''Una famiglia di matematici…'', p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Riccati would criticize Grandi's argument in his 1754 ''Saggio intorno al sistema dell'universo'', saying that it causes contradictions. He argues that one could just as well write {{nowrap|1=''n'' − ''n'' + ''n'' − ''n'' + · · · = ''n''/(1 + 1),}} but that this series has "the same quantity of zeroes" as Grandi's series. These zeroes lack any evanescent character of ''n'', as Riccati points out that the equality {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 = ''n'' − ''n''}} is guaranteed by {{nowrap|1=1 + ''n'' = ''n'' + 1.}} He concludes that the fundamental mistake is in using a divergent series to begin with:
{{quote|text=In fact, it doesn't happen that if we stop this series, the following terms can be neglected in comparison with preceding terms; this property is verified only for convergent series."&lt;ref&gt;Bagni p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another 1754 publication also criticized Grandi's series on the basis of its collapse to 0. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] briefly treats the series in his acclaimed 1754 textbook ''Traité du calcul intégral''. He explains that a series is "true" if its sum is equal to the expression from which is expanded; otherwise it is "false". Thus Grandi's series is false because {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + 1) = 1/2}} and yet {{nowrap|1=(1 − 1) + (1 − 1) + · · · = 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bougainville vol.1, ch.22, pts.318-320, pp.309-312; Schubring p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euler==
{{further|Euler on infinite series}}

[[Leonhard Euler]] treats {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} along with other divergent series in his ''De seriebus divergentibus'', a 1746 paper that was read to the Academy in 1754 and published in 1760. He identifies the series as being first considered by Leibniz, and he reviews Leibniz's 1713 argument based on the series {{nowrap|1=1 − ''a'' + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + · · ·}}, calling it "fairly sound reasoning", and he also mentions the even/odd median argument. Euler writes that the usual objection to the use of {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''a'')}} is that it does not equal {{nowrap|1=1 − ''a'' + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + · · ·}} unless ''a'' is less than 1; otherwise all one can say is that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+a} = 1 - a + a^2 - a^3 + \cdots \pm a^n \mp \frac{a^{n+1}}{1+a},&lt;/math&gt;
where the last remainder term does not vanish and cannot be disregarded as ''n'' is taken to infinity. Still writing in the third person, Euler mentions a possible rebuttal to the objection: essentially, since an infinite series has no last term, there is no place for the remainder and it should be neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Euler 1760 §§3-5, pp.206-207; English translation in Barbeau and Leah pp.145-146&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing more badly divergent series like {{nowrap|1=[[1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + · · ·]]}}, where he judges his opponents to have firmer support, Euler seeks to define away the issue:

{{quote|text=Yet however substantial this particular dispute seems to be, neither side can be convicted of any error by the other side, whenever the use of such series occurs in analysis, and this ought to be a strong argument that neither side is in error, but that all disagreement is solely verbal. For if in a calculation I arrive at this series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 etc.}} and if in its place I substitute 1/2, no one will rightly impute to me an error, which however everyone would do had I put some other number in the place of this series. Whence no doubt can remain that in fact the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + etc.}} and the fraction 1/2 are equivalent quantities and that it is always permitted to substitute one for the other without error. Thus the whole question is seen to reduce to this, whether we call the fraction 1/2 the correct sum of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + etc.}}; and it is strongly to be feared that those who insist on denying this and who at the same time do not dare to deny the equivalence have stumbled into a battle over words.

But I think all this wrangling can be easily ended if we should carefully attend to what follows…&lt;ref&gt;Euler 1760 §10 and beginning of §11, p.211; English translation by Barbeau and Leah (p.148)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Euler also used [[finite difference]]s to attack {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. In modern terminology, he took the [[Euler transform]] of the sequence and found that it equalled &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guinness pp.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1864, De Morgan claims that "this transformation has always appeared one of the strongest presumptions in favour of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − …}} being &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilution and new values==
Despite the confident tone of his papers, Euler expressed doubt over divergent series in his correspondence with Nicolaus I Bernoulli. Euler claimed that his attempted definition had never failed him, but Bernoulli pointed out a clear weakness: it does not specify how one should determine "the" finite expression that generates a given infinite series. Not only is this a practical difficulty, it would be theoretically fatal if a series were generated by expanding two expressions with different values. Euler's treatment of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} rests upon his firm belief that &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the only possible value of the series; what if there were another?

In a 1745 letter to [[Christian Goldbach]], Euler claimed that he was not aware of any such counterexample, and in any case Bernoulli had not provided one. Several decades later, when [[Jean-Charles Callet]] finally asserted a counterexample, it was aimed at {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. The background of the new idea begins with [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.14; Bromwich p.322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel Bernoulli===
*{{cite journal |last=Bernoulli |first=Daniel |title=De summationibus serierum quarunduam incongrue veris earumque interpretatione atque usu |journal= Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum imperialis Petropolitanae |volume=16 |year=1771 |pages=71–90}}

Daniel Bernoulli, who accepted the probabilistic argument that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, noticed that by inserting 0s into the series in the right places, it could achieve any value between 0 and 1. In particular, the argument suggested that
:1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Sandifer p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Further: Moore pp.3-4--&gt;

===Callet and Lagrange===
In a memorandum sent to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] toward the end of the century, Callet pointed out that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} could also be obtained from the series
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1+x}{1+x+x^2}=1-x^2+x^3-x^5+x^6-x^8+\cdots;&lt;/math&gt;
substituting ''x'' = 1 now suggests a value of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, not &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Lagrange approved Callet's submission for publication in the ''Mémoires'' of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], but it was never directly published. Instead, Lagrange (along with [[Charles Bossut]]) summarized Callet's work and responded to it in the ''Mémoires'' of 1799. He defended Euler by suggesting that Callet's series actually should be written with the 0 terms left in:
:&lt;math&gt;1+0-x^2+x^3+0-x^5+x^6+0-x^8+\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
which reduces to
:1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + · · ·
instead.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich pp.319-320, Lehmann p.176, Kline 1972 p.463; here Bromwich seems to cite Borel's ''Leçons sur les Séries Divergentes'', pp.1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Other objections: Smail p.2--&gt;

==19th century==
The 19th century is remembered as the approximate period of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]]'s largely successful ban on the use of divergent series, but Grandi's series continued to make occasional appearances. Some mathematicians did not follow Abel's lead, mostly outside France, and British mathematicians especially took "a long time" to understand the analysis coming from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[Robert Woodhouse]] proposed that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} summed to something called
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1},&lt;/math&gt;
which could be distinguished from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] remarks on this proposal, "… R. Woodhouse … wrote with admirable honesty on the problems which he failed to understand. … Of course, there is no harm in defining new symbols such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1+1&lt;/sub&gt;; but the idea is 'formalist' in the unflattering sense, and it does not bear on the problem of the convergence of series."&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guinness p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebraic reasoning===

In 1830, a mathematician identified only as "M. R. S." wrote in the ''[[Annales de Gergonne]]'' on a technique to numerically find fixed points of functions of one variable. If one can transform a problem into the form of an equation ''x = A + f(x)'', where ''A'' can be chosen at will, then 
:&lt;math&gt;x = A+f(A+f(A+f(\cdots)))&lt;/math&gt;
should be a solution, and truncating this infinite expression results in a sequence of approximations. Conversely, given the series {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' − ''a'' + ''a'' − ''a'' + · · ·}}, the author recovers the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = a - x,&lt;/math&gt;
to which the solution is (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''a''.

M. R. S. notes that the approximations in this case are ''a'', 0, ''a'', 0, …, but there is no need for Leibniz's "subtle reasoning". Moreover, the argument for averaging the approximations is problematic in a wider context. For equations not of the form ''x = A + f(x)'', M. R. S.'s solutions are [[continued fraction]]s, [[continued radical]]s, and other infinite expressions. In particular, the expression {{nowrap|1=''a'' / (''a'' / (''a'' / · · · )))}} should be a solution of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a''/''x''}}. Here, M. R. S. writes that based on Leibniz's reasoning, one is tempted to conclude that ''x'' is the average of the truncations ''a'', 1, ''a'', 1, …. This average is {{nowrap|1=(1 + ''a'')/2}}, but the solution to the equation is the [[square root]] of ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;M.R.S. pp.363-365&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Bolzano]] criticized M. R. S.' algebraic solution of the series. In reference to the step
:&lt;math&gt;x = a-a+a-a+\cdots = a-(a-a+a-\cdots),&lt;/math&gt;
Bolzano charged,
{{quote|text=The series within parentheses has clearly not the same set of numbers of that originally indicated with ''x'', as the first term ''a'' is missing.}}
This comment exemplifies Bolzano's intuitively appealing but deeply problematic views on infinity. In his defense, [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] himself pointed out that Bolzano worked in a time when the concept of the [[cardinality]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] was absent.&lt;ref&gt;Sbaragli p.27; the primary source for Bolzano is not given, but it appears to be Moreno and Waldegg (1991), "The conceptual evolution of actual mathematical infinity". ''Educational studies in mathematics''. 22, 211-231. The primary source for Cantor is his 1932 ''Gesammelte Abhandlngen''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Morgan and company===
As late as 1844, [[Augustus De Morgan]] commented that if a single instance where {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} did not equal &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be given, he would be willing to reject the entire theory of trigonometric series.&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1972 p.976&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=I do not argue with those who reject everything that is not within the providence of arithmetic, but only with those who abandon the use of infinitely divergent series and yet appear to employ finitely divergent series with confidence. Such appears to be the practice, both at home and abroad. They seem perfectly reconciled to {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}, but cannot admit {{nowrap|1=1 + 2 + 4 + · · · = −1}}.&lt;ref name="Hardy19"&gt;Hardy p.19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=The whole fabric of periodic series and integrals … would fall instantly if it were shown to be possible that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} might be one quantity as a limiting form of {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − · · · }}and another as a limiting form of {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − · · ·.}}&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same volume contains papers by [[Samuel Earnshaw]] and [[J R Young]] dealing in part with {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. [[G. H. Hardy]] dismisses both of these as "little more than nonsense", in contrast to De Morgan's "remarkable mixture of acuteness and confusion";&lt;ref name="Hardy19" /&gt; in any case, Earnshaw got De Morgan's attention with the following remarks:

{{quote|text=…it is not very unusual to cast a mantle of mystery over this subject, by introducing zeros into the expansion of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1+1+1&lt;/sub&gt;. But such a device, however much it may serve to satisfy the eye, cannot satisfy the head…&lt;ref&gt;Earnshaw p.261, partially quoted in De Morgan 1864 p.1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

De Morgan fired back in 1864 in the same journal:
{{quote|text=I cannot approve of introducing ciphers to satisfy the eye: but to me they always ''introduced themselves.'' … those who reject casual evanescents out of a routine of operation have no right to charge those who do ''not reject'' with ''introduction.''&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan 1864 pp.1-2; emphases are his&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Frobenius and modern mathematics==
{{main|Summation of Grandi's series}}

The last scholarly article to be motivated by 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · might be identified as the first article in the modern history of divergent series.&lt;ref&gt;For example, it is presented as such in Smail pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Frobenius]] published an article titled "Ueber die Leibnitzsche Reihe" (''On Leibniz's series'') in 1880. He had found Leibniz's old letter to Wolff, citing it along with an 1836 article by [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe]], who in turn drew on ideas by Leibniz and Daniel Bernoulli.&lt;ref&gt;Raabe p.355; Frobenius p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

Frobenius' short paper, barely two pages, begins by quoting from Leibniz's treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·. He infers that Leibniz was actually stating a generalization of [[Abel's Theorem]]. The result, now known as [[Frobenius' theorem (divergent series)|Frobenius' theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Smail p.4&lt;/ref&gt; has a simple statement in modern terms: any series that is [[Cesàro summation|Cesàro summable]] is also [[Abel summation|Abel summable]] to the same sum. Historian Giovanni Ferraro emphasizes that Frobenius did not actually state the theorem in such terms, and Leibniz did not state it at all. Leibniz was defending the association of the divergent series {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} with the value &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while Frobenius' theorem is stated in terms of convergent sequences and the [[epsilon-delta]] formulation of the [[limit of a function]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 1999 p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

Frobenius' theorem was soon followed with further generalizations by [[Otto Hölder]] and [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes]] in 1882. Again, to a modern reader their work strongly suggests new definitions of the sum of a divergent series, but those authors did not yet make that step. [[Ernesto Cesàro]] proposed a systematic definition for the first time in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 1999 pp.117, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, mathematicians have explored many different summability methods for divergent series. Most of these, especially the simpler ones with historical parallels, sum Grandi's series to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Others, motivated by Daniel Bernoulli's work, sum the series to another value, and a few do not sum it at all.

The '''history of mathematical notation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]]. A History of Mathematical Notations: Two Volumes in One. Cosimo, Inc., Dec 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; includes the commencement, progress, and [[cultural diffusion]] of [[mathematical symbol]]s and the conflict of the methods of notation confronted in a notation's move to popularity or inconspicuousness. [[Mathematical notation]]&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art, Volume 2. Edited by [[William Thomas Brande]], [[George William Cox]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5tPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the [[symbol]]s used to write mathematical [[equation]]s and [[formula]]s. Notation generally implies a set of [[well-defined]] representations of quantities and symbols operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Notation.html |title=Notation - from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history includes [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]], letters from the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[German alphabet|German]] [[alphabet]]s, and a host of symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.

The development of mathematical notation can be divided in stages.&lt;ref&gt;Diophantos of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra. By Sir Thomas Little Heath. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABkPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics: Its Power and Utility. By Karl J. Smith. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0x2JszrkooC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[rhetorical]]''" stage is where calculations are performed by words and no symbols are used.&lt;ref&gt;The Commercial Revolution and the Beginnings of Western Mathematics in Renaissance Florence, 1300–1500. Warren Van Egmond. 1976. Page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[syncopated]]''" stage is where frequently used operations and quantities are represented by symbolic [[syntax|syntactical]] abbreviations. From ancient times through the post-classical age,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation.  As the [[early modern age]] opened and the worldwide spread of knowledge began, written examples of mathematical developments came to light.  The "''symbolic''" stage is where comprehensive systems of notation supersede rhetoric. Beginning in Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This symbolic system was in use by medieval Indian mathematicians and in Europe since the middle of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Gandz]]. "The Sources of al-Khowarizmi's Algebra"&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to develop in the [[contemporary era]].

The area of study known as the [[history of mathematics]] is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, the focus here, the investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.

==Rhetorical stage==
{{see also|Measurement}}
Although the history commences with that of the [[#Acrophonic and Milesian numeration|Ionian schools]], there is no doubt that those [[Ancient Greek]]s who paid attention to it were largely indebted to the previous investigations of the [[Ancient Egyptian]]s and [[Phoenicia|Ancient Phoenicians]]. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values ([[arithmetic]]), implies a state of [[civilization]] at the period of its invention. Our knowledge of the mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of [[Applied mathematics|real world problems]], before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the [[distance|calculation of distances]] and [[area]]s in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

There can be no doubt that most early peoples which have left records knew something of [[numeration]] and [[mechanics]], and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of [[Surveying|land-surveying]]. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, [[book-keeping]], [[navigation]], and land-surveying. The [[Knowledge transfer|results attained by these people seem to have been accessible]], under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of [[observation]] and [[measurement]], and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.

===Beginning of notation===
{{see also|Ancient history|History of writing ancient numbers|History of science in early cultures}}

Written mathematics began with numbers expressed as [[tally marks]], with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such characters, in fact, are preserved with little alteration in the [[Roman notation]], an account of which may be found in [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]'s Philosophy of Arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, or anything else. The peoples with whom the Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in western history begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern [[littoral]] of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, and that of the [[number theory|science of numbers]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Number theory]] is branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the [[Integer|study of the integers]]. Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the [[integer]]s (e.g., [[algebraic integer]]s).&lt;/ref&gt; either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.

The [[Ancient Egyptians]] had a symbolic notation which was the [[numeration by Hieroglyphics]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Americana. By Thomas Gamaliel Bradford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrRPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 314]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Excursion, Enhanced Edition: Enhanced Webassign Edition By Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, Richard D. Nation, Daniel K. Cleg. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgTnSGMukgC&amp;pg=PA186 186]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Egyptian mathematics]] had a symbol for one, ten, one-hundred, one-thousand, ten-thousand, one-hundred-thousand, and one-million.  Smaller digits were placed on the left of the number, as they are in Hindu–Arabic numerals.  Later, the Egyptians used [[hieratic]] instead of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] script to show numbers.  Hieratic was more like cursive and replaced several groups of symbols with individual ones.  For example, the four vertical lines used to represent four were replaced by a single horizontal line.  This is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 2000–1800 BC) and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1890 BC).  The system the Egyptians used was discovered and modified by many other civilizations in the Mediterranean.  The Egyptians also had symbols for basic operations: legs going forward represented addition, and legs walking backward to represent subtraction.

The [[Mesopotamians]] had symbols for each power of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metu.edu.tr/~beyaz/303/presentations/egyptMesopotamia.pdf Mathematics in Egypt and Mesopotamia]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, they wrote their numbers in almost exactly the same way done in modern times.  Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, they would just put the [[coefficient]] of that number.  Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of [[Alexander the Great]], they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder.  The Mesopotamians also used a [[sexagesimal]] system, that is base sixty.  It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd ed. rev. by [[Uta Merzbach|Uta C. Merzbach]]. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "Mesopotamia" p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians and the system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003). [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/3Mill/chronology.html Third Millennium Chronology], ''Third Millennium Mathematics''. [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. The Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]]. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.

The history of mathematics cannot with certainty be traced back to any school or period before that of the Ionian Greeks, but the subsequent history may be divided into periods, the distinctions between which are tolerably well marked. Greek mathematics, which originated with the study of geometry, tended from its commencement to be deductive and scientific. Since the fourth century AD, [[Pythagoras]] has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]], a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient mathematical texts are available with the prior mentioned Ancient Egyptians notation and with [[Plimpton 322]] (Babylonian mathematics c. 1900 BC).  The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning "subject of instruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by widening the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]] and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: "In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who made mathematics a science."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] is credited with what later would be called the [[law of excluded middle]].

''Abstract Mathematics''&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Perthensi" /&gt; is what treats of magnitude&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Magnitude (mathematics)]], the relative size of an object ; [[Magnitude (vector)]], a term for the size or length of a vector; [[Scalar (mathematics)]], a quantity defined only by its magnitude; [[Euclidean vector]], a quantity defined by both its magnitude and its direction; [[Order of magnitude]], the class of scale having a fixed value ratio to the preceding class.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[quantity]], absolutely and generally conferred, without regard to any species of particular magnitude, such as [[Arithmetic]] and [[Geometry]], In this sense, abstract mathematics is opposed to [[applied mathematics|mixed mathematics]]; wherein simple and abstract properties, and the relations of quantities primitively considered in mathematics, are applied to sensible objects, and by that means become intermixed with physical considerations; Such are [[Hydrostatics]], [[Optics]], [[Navigation]], &amp;c.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Perthensi"&gt;The new encyclopædia; or, Universal dictionary of arts and sciences. By Encyclopaedia Perthensi. Pg 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archimedes]] is generally considered to be the greatest [[mathematician]] of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald |title=A Contextual History of Mathematics |year=1999 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-02-318285-7 |page=150 |quote=Shortly after Euclid, compiler of the definitive textbook, came Archimedes of Syracuse (ca. 287&amp;nbsp;212 BC), the most original and profound mathematician of antiquity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Archimedes.html |title=Archimedes of Syracuse |accessdate=2008-06-09 |publisher=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070715191704/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html| archivedate= 15 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also defined the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name, formulae for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.

In the historical development of geometry, the steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks. [[Euclid's Elements]] being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry— though Proclus tells of an earlier [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] by [[Hippocrates of Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |title=Proclus' Summary |publisher=Gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114020/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid's ''Elements'' (c. 300 BC) is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Autolycus]]' [[On the Moving Sphere]] is another ancient mathematical manuscript of the time.&lt;/ref&gt; and consisted of 13 books written in Alexandria; collecting theorems proven by other mathematicians, supplemented by some original work.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Proclus]], a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the Elements: "Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]' theorems, perfecting many of [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors".&lt;/ref&gt; The document is a successful collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. [[Euclid's lemma|Euclid's first theorem]] is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that possesses properties of [[prime number]]s. The influential thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry, geometric algebra, and the ancient Greek version of algebraic systems and elementary number theory. It was ubiquitous in the [[Quadrivium]] and is instrumental in the development of logic, mathematics, and science.

[[Diophantus of Alexandria]] was author of a series of books called ''[[Arithmetica]]'',  many of which are now lost. These texts deal with solving [[algebraic equation]]s. [[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''quadrivium'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid's ''Elements''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) "The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''", pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence'', (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''"Boethius" Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acrophonic and Milesian numeration===

The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] employed [[Attic numeration]],&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics and Measurement By Oswald Ashton Wentworth Dilk. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=AKJZvXOS7n4C&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Greek numerals]] one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter Π (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, ''pente''. Numbers six through nine were ''pente'' with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (Δ) of the word for ten, ''deka'', one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.

The [[Ionian numeration]] used their entire alphabet including three archaic letters. The numeral notation of the Greeks, though far less convenient than that now in use, was formed on a perfectly regular and scientific plan,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;A dictionary of science, literature and art, ed. by W.T. Brande. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=yo4DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; and could be used with tolerable effect as an instrument of calculation, to which purpose the Roman system was totally inapplicable. The Greeks divided the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes, and, by adding another symbol to each class, they had characters to represent the units, tens, and hundreds. ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s Astronomie Ancienne, t. ii.)

This system appeared in the third century BC, before the letters digamma (Ϝ), koppa (Ϟ), and sampi (Ϡ) became obsolete. When lowercase letters became differentiated from upper case letters, the lower case letters were used as the symbols for notation. Multiples of one thousand were written as the nine numbers with a stroke in front of them: thus one thousand was ",α", two-thousand was ",β", etc. M (for μὐριοι, as in "myriad") was used to multiply numbers by ten thousand. For example, the number 88,888,888 would be written as M,ηωπη*ηωπη&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;Boyer, Carl B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematical reasoning was almost entirely [[geometry|geometric]] (albeit often used to reason about non-geometric subjects such as [[number theory]]), and hence the Greeks had no interest in [[algebra]]ic symbols.

[[File:Huama numerals.svg|thumb|The numbers 0–9 in Chinese huāmǎ (花碼) numerals]]
The Chinese used numerals that look much like the tally system.&lt;ref&gt;The American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 16. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=JggPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131 131]&lt;/ref&gt;  Numbers one through four were horizontal lines.  Five was an X between two horizontal lines; it looked almost exactly the same as the [[Roman numeral]] for ten. Nowadays, the [[Numerals in Unicode#CJK Suzhou (huāmǎ) numerals|huāmǎ system]] is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

In the history of the Chinese, there were those who were familiar with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. [[Mathematics in China]] emerged independently by the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Chinese_overview.html |title=Overview of Chinese mathematics |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[Ruler|rule]], [[Try square|square]], [[compasses]], [[spirit level|water level]] ([[reed level]]), and [[plumb-bob]].&lt;/ref&gt; with mechanical machines;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[wheel]] and [[axle]]&lt;/ref&gt; that they knew of the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and [[negative number]]s, [[decimal]]s, a place value decimal system, a [[Binary numeral system|binary system]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]].

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|Counting rod numerals]]
[[Counting rods|Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]].&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140—148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428—437&lt;/ref&gt;  The geometrical theorem known to the ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The area of the square described on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares described on the sides&lt;/ref&gt; It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the quasi-experimental way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge seems to have been confined to the art of calculation by means of the [[swan-pan]], and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though it is, is more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.

As in other early societies the focus was on [[astronomy]] in order to perfect the agricultural [[calendar]], and other practical tasks, and not on establishing [[formal systems]].The [[Chinese Board of Mathematics]] duties were confined to the annual preparation of an almanac, the dates and predictions in which it regulated. Ancient Chinese mathematicians did not develop an axiomatic approach, but made advances in algorithm development and algebra. The achievement of Chinese algebra reached its zenith in the 13th century, when [[Zhu Shijie]] invented method of four unknowns.

As a result of obvious linguistic and geographic barriers, as well as content, Chinese mathematics and that of the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world are presumed to have developed more or less independently up to the time when ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' reached its final form, while the ''[[Writings on Reckoning]]'' and ''[[Huainanzi]]'' are roughly contemporary with classical Greek mathematics. Some exchange of ideas across Asia through known cultural exchanges from at least Roman times is likely. Frequently, elements of the mathematics of early societies correspond to rudimentary results found later in branches of modern mathematics such as geometry or [[number theory]]. The [[Pythagorean theorem#History|Pythagorean theorem]] for example, [[Zhoubi Suanjing|has been attested]] to the time of the [[Duke of Zhou]]. Knowledge of [[Pascal's triangle]] has also been shown to have existed in China centuries before [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/books/titles/0-271-01238-2.html |title=Frank J.

[[File:Shen Kua.JPG|thumb|Modern artist's impression of [[Shen Kuo]].]]
The state of [[trigonometry]] in China slowly began to change and advance during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), where Chinese mathematicians began to express greater emphasis for the need of spherical trigonometry in calendarical science and astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"/&gt; The [[polymath]] Chinese scientist, mathematician and official [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) used trigonometric functions to solve mathematical problems of chords and arcs.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for [[spherical trigonometry]] developed in the 13th century by the mathematician and astronomer [[Guo Shoujing]] (1231–1316).&lt;ref name="restivo 32"&gt;[[Sal Restivo]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the historians L. Gauchet and Joseph Needham state, Guo Shoujing used [[spherical trigonometry]] in his calculations to improve the [[Chinese calendar|calendar system]] and [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109 2"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gauchet 151"&gt;[[Marcel Gauchet]], 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical science of the Chinese would incorporate the work and teaching of Arab missionaries with knowledge of spherical trigonometry who had come to China in the course of the thirteenth century.

===Indian mathematical notation===
Although the origin of our present system of numerical notation is ancient, there is no doubt that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]], [[Brahmagupta]], was [[History of algebra#Diophantine algebra|syncopated]]. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the [[subtrahend]] (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations"&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "China and India" p. 221. (cf., "he was the first one to give a ''general'' solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave ''all'' integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India – or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words.")&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html |title="The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius." - Pierre-Simon Laplace |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu–Arabic numerals and notations====
{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
Despite their name, Arabic numerals actually started in India. The reason for this [[misnomer]] is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, ''[[Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning]]'', by [[al-Khwarizmi|Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi]]. Al-Khwārizmī wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Al-Kindi also introduced [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]].&lt;/ref&gt; were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'').

[[Islamic mathematics]] developed and expanded the mathematics known to [[Central Asia]]n civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Yushkevich|A.P. Juschkewitsch]], "Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230. (cf., "The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwārizmī's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions.")&lt;/ref&gt; and Al-Khwārizmī was to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, pp. 263–77: "In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī also discussed the fundamental method of "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229. (cf.,  "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing" - that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.")&lt;/ref&gt; His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of [[problem]]s to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." Al-Khwārizmī also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=0-7923-2565-6 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Karaji]], in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor J. Katz (1998). ''History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', pp. 255–59. [[Addison-Wesley]]. {{ISBN|0-321-01618-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historian]] of mathematics, F. Woepcke,&lt;ref&gt;F. Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]]." Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] would develop [[analytic geometry]]. Al-Haytham derived the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] would develop [[algebraic geometry]], wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]].

Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], which led to further development of mathematics in medieval Europe. In the 12th century, scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-Khwārizmī's&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators", pp. 421–62 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beaujouan, "The Transformation of the Quadrivium", pp. 463–87 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the European books that advocated using the numerals was ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', by Leonardo of Pisa, better known as [[Fibonacci]]. ''Liber Abaci'' is better known for the mathematical problem Fibonacci wrote in it about a population of rabbits.  The growth of the population ended up being a [[Fibonacci sequence]], where a term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

[[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] (1412–1482) was the last major medieval [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab algebraist]], who improved on the [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] earlier used by [[Ibn al-Yasamin|Ibn al-Yāsamīn]] in the 12th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and, in the [[Maghreb]], by [[Ibn al-Banna]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the syncopated notations of their predecessors, [[Diophantus]] and [[Brahmagupta]], which lacked symbols for [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operations]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178 (cf., "The chief difference between Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic notation is the lack of special symbols for operations and relations, as well as of the exponential notation.")&lt;/ref&gt; al-Qalasadi's algebraic notation was the first to have symbols for these functions and was thus "the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism." He represented [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] using characters from the [[Arabic alphabet]].&lt;ref name=Qalasadi/&gt;

The study of [[linear algebra]] emerged from the study of [[determinant]]s, which were used to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s. Calculus had two main systems of notation, each created by one of the creators: that developed by [[Isaac Newton]] and the notation developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]].  Leibniz's is the notation used most often today.  Newton's was simply a dot or dash placed above the function.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  The second derivative of ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, this notation generally denotes derivatives of physical quantities with respect to time, and is used frequently in the science of [[mechanics]]. Leibniz, on the other hand, used the letter ''d'' as a prefix to indicate differentiation, and introduced the notation representing derivatives as if they were a special type of fraction.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' with respect to the variable ''t'' in Leibniz's notation would be written as &lt;math&gt;{ dx \over dt }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This notation makes explicit the variable with respect to which the derivative of the function is taken. Leibniz also created the integral symbol.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\int_{-N}^{N} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol is an [[long s|elongated S]], representing the [[Latin]] word ''Summa'', meaning "sum".  When finding areas under curves, integration is often illustrated by dividing the area into infinitely many tall, thin rectangles, whose areas are added.  Thus, the integral symbol is an elongated s, for sum.

===High division operators and functions===
{{see also|modern age}}
[[Letters of the alphabet]] in this time were to be used as symbols of [[quantity]]; and although much diversity existed with respect to the choice of letters, there were to be several [[Open standard|universally recognized rules]] in the following history.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Here thus in the history of equations the first letters of the alphabet were indicatively known as [[coefficients]], the last letters the [[dict:unknown|unknown term]]s (an  ''[[Unknown known#Unknown knowns|incerti ordinis]]''). In [[algebraic geometry]], again, a similar rule was to be observed, the last letters of the alphabet there denoting the variable or current [[coordinates]]. Certain letters, such as &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, [[etc.]], were by [[consensus gentium|universal consent]] appropriated as symbols of the frequently occurring numbers [[Pi|3.14159 ...]], and [[e (mathematical constant)|2.7182818 ....]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[List of representations of e]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc., and their use in any other acceptation was to be avoided as much as possible.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Letters, too, were to be employed as symbols of operation, and with them other previously mentioned arbitrary operation characters. The letters [[d|&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;]], [[long s|elongated &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;]] were to be appropriated as operative symbols in the [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], [[Delta (letter)|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;]] and ∑ in the [[calculus of differences]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In [[Functional (mathematics)|functional notation]], a letter, as a symbol of operation, is combined with another which is regarded as a symbol of [[Quantity#Quantity in mathematics|quantity]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Thus &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Result|mathematical result]] of the performance of the operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon the [[Mathematical object|subject]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If upon this result the same operation were repeated, the new result would be expressed by &lt;math&gt;f[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;, or more concisely by &lt;math&gt;f^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. The quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself regarded as the result of the same operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon some other function; the proper symbol for which is, by analogy, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are symbols of [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse operation]]s, the former cancelling the effect of the latter on the subject &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt; in a similar manner are termed [[inverse function]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1718, Thomas Twinin used the [[Slash (punctuation)|division slash]] ([[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]]), deriving it from the earlier Arabic [[horizontal fraction bar]]. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace]] developed the widely used [[Laplace operator|Laplacian differential operator]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(p) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, [[Gabriel Cramer]] developed "''[[Cramer's Rule]]''" for solving [[linear system]]s.

====Euler and prime notations====
[[File:Euler's signature.png|thumbnail|Leonhard Euler's signature]]
[[Leonhard Euler]] was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, and also a prolific inventor of canonical notation. [[Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics|His contributions]] include his use of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' to represent the base of [[natural logarithm]]s.  It is not known exactly why &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; was chosen, but it was probably because the four letters of the alphabet were already commonly used to represent variables and other constants.  Euler used &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to represent [[pi]] consistently.  The use of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was suggested by [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]], who used it as shorthand for [[perimeter]].  Euler used &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to represent the square root of negative one,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although he earlier used it as an ''infinite number.'' &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Today, the symbol created by [[John Wallis]], &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, is used for infinity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As in, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For [[summation]], Euler used [[sigma]], [[Capital-sigma notation|Σ]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Capital-sigma notation]] uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the ''summation symbol'', ''[[Sigma|∑]]'', an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]. This is defined as: &lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} +\cdots+ a_{n-1} + a_n. &lt;/math&gt;|cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;br&gt;
Where, ''i'' represents the ''index of summation''; ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series; ''m'' is the ''lower bound of summation'', and ''n'' is the ''upper bound of summation''. The ''"i = m"'' under the summation symbol means that the index ''i'' starts out equal to ''m''.  The index, ''i'', is incremented by 1 for each successive term, stopping when ''i'' = ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[function (mathematics)|functions]], Euler used the notation &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to represent a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In 1730, Euler wrote the [[gamma function]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;n!=\int_{0}^{1}(-\ln s)^{n}\,{\rm d}s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; valid for n &gt; 0.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, Euler produces his paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Euler, Leonhard, [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E053.pdf Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis]&lt;/ref&gt; initiating the study of [[graph theory]].

The [[William Emerson (mathematician)|mathematician, William Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x_82AAAAMAAJ The elements of geometry]. By William Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; would develop the [[proportionality sign]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;div style="font-size:200%;"&gt;∝&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Proportionality is the [[ratio]] of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios; See [[Proportionality (mathematics)]], the relationship of two variables whose ratio is constant. See also [[aspect ratio]], geometric proportions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLxHMwEACAAJ The Doctrine of Proportion, Arithmetical and Geometrical.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=IXkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 83]&lt;/ref&gt; Much later in the abstract expressions of the value of various proportional phenomena, the [[parts-per notation]] would become useful as a set of pseudo units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]. [[Marquis de Condorcet]], in 1768, advanced the [[partial differential]] sign.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''[[Curl (mathematics)|curly d]]'' or ''[[Jacobi's delta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1771, [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] deduced the importance of topological features when discussing the [[Knot theory|properties of knots]] related to the geometry of position. Between 1772 and 1788, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] re-formulated the formulas and calculations of Classical "Newtonian" mechanics, called [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. The [[prime symbol]] for derivatives was also made by Lagrange.

====Gauss, Hamilton, and Matrix notations====
At the turn of the 19th century, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] developed the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity sign]] for [[congruence relation]] and, in [[Quadratic reciprocity]], the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]]. Gauss contributed [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]]. He gave the satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]]. Gauss developed the theory of solving linear systems by using [[Gaussian elimination]], which was initially listed as an advancement in [[geodesy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitulli |first=Marie |authorlink= Marie A.

After the 1800s, [[Christian Kramp]] would promote [[factorial]] notation during his research in generalized factorial function which applied to non-integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kramp.html |title=Kramp biography |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] introduced the [[set inclusion]] signs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, "subset of" and "superset of"; This would later be redeveloped by [[Ernst Schröder]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] developed [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet ''L''-functions]] to give the proof of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] and began [[analytic number theory]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A [[number theory|science of numbers]] that uses methods from [[mathematical analysis]] to solve problems about the integers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, Gauss proved his [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem'' in Latin), establishing property of surfaces. In the 1830s, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] developed [[Green's function]]. In 1829. [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] publishes [[Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum]] with his [[Elliptic function|elliptic]] [[theta function]]s. By 1841, [[Karl Weierstrass]], the "father of modern [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]", elaborated on the concept of [[absolute value]] and the [[determinant of a matrix]].

[[Matrix notation]] would be more fully developed by [[Arthur Cayley]] in his three papers, on subjects which had been suggested by reading the [[Mécanique analytique]]&lt;ref&gt;Mécanique analytique: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MKAAAAYAAJ Volume 1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=hclDyo8wE44C Volume 2]. By [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Ms. [[Ve Courcier]], 1811.&lt;/ref&gt; of Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace. Cayley defined [[matrix multiplication]] and [[matrix inverse]]s. Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ The collected mathematical papers of Arthur Cayley]. Volume 11. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA243 243].&lt;/ref&gt; thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1. By Ari Ben-Menahem.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though his use describes something different from what is now meant by a tensor. Namely, the [[norm (mathematics)|norm operation]] in a certain type of algebraic system (now known as a [[Clifford algebra]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Cockle (lawyer)|James Cockle]] would develop the [[tessarine]]s&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is,&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;t = w + x i + y j + z k, \quad w, x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;where &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; i j = j i = k, \quad i^2 = -1, \quad j^2 = +1 .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1849, [[coquaternion]]s. In 1848, [[James Joseph Sylvester]] introduced into [[matrix algebra]] the term [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is Latin for "womb".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maxwell, Clifford, and Ricci notations====
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumbnail|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]
----
Maxwell's most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that united previously unrelated observations, experiments, and equations of [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] into a consistent theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] reduced all of the then current knowledge of electromagnetism into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables, contained in ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.&lt;ref name=ADTEF&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008 |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field | url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF  |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865}} (This article accompanied a December 8, 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.)&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Maxwell's equations]].) The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ was given by Lagrange, and afterwards developed, with some modifications, by [[Hamilton's equations]]. It is usually referred to as [[Hamilton's principle]]; when the equations in the original form are used they are known as [[Lagrange's equations]]. In 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] called a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In 1873 Maxwell presented ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''.

In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] published his [[Elements of Dynamic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami01clifiala|Books I, II, III (1878)}}; {{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami02clifiala|Book IV (1887)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford developed [[split-biquaternion]]s,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, [[History of quaternions|&lt;math&gt;q = w + xi + yj + zk &lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; which he called ''algebraic motors''. Clifford obviated quaternion study by separating the [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] of two vectors from the complete quaternion notation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Clifford intersected algebra with Hamilton's quaternions by replacing [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 by the rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. For more details, see [[exterior algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach made [[vector calculus]] available to engineers and others working in [[three dimensions]] and [[skeptical]] of the [[Phase (waves)|lead–lag effect]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [[Phasor]], [[Group (mathematics)]], [[Signal velocity]], [[Polyphase system]], [[Harmonic oscillator]], and [[RLC series circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. See also: [[Spacetime]], the unification of time and space as a four-dimensional [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]]; and, [[Minkowski space]], the mathematical setting for special relativity.&lt;/ref&gt;  The common [[vector notation]]s are used when working with vectors which are [[vector (geometric)|spatial]] or more abstract members of [[vector space]]s, while [[angle notation]] (or [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] notation) is a notation used in [[electronics]].

In 1881, [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a "domain of rationality", which is a [[field extension]] of the [[Field of rationals|field of rational numbers]] in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Galois Theory | volume=106 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | first=David A. | last=Cox | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2012 | isbn=1118218426 | page=348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hüseyin Tevfik Paşa|tr}} wrote the book titled "Linear Algebra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.istanbul.edu.tr/tr/index.php/oba/article/download/9103/8452 |title=TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM DergiPark |publisher=Journals.istanbul.edu.tr |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/linearalgebra00tevfgoog |title=Linear Algebra : Hussein Tevfik : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Kelvin]]'s  [[Aether theories|aetheric]] [[atomic theory|atom theory]] (1860s) led [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], in 1885, to publish a [[topology|topological]] table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the [[Tait conjectures]]. In 1893, [[Heinrich M. Weber]] gave the clear definition of an [[Finite field|abstract field]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[Field (mathematics)|Mathematic fields]] and [[Field extension]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tensor calculus]] was developed by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] between 1887–96, presented in 1892 under the title ''absolute differential calculus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1895 [[Giuseppe Peano]] issued his ''[[Formulario mathematico]]'',&lt;ref&gt;
There are many editions. Here are two:

[[:openlibrary:books/OL16587658M/Formulario mathematico|OpenLibrary OL16587658M]].&lt;/ref&gt;  an effort to digest mathematics into terse text based on special symbols. He would provide a definition of a [[vector space]] and [[linear map]]. He would also introduce the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection sign]], the [[union sign]], the [[membership sign]] (is an element of), and [[existential quantifier]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This raises questions of the [[existence theorem|pure existence theorems]].&lt;/ref&gt; (there exists). Peano would pass to [[Bertrand Russell]] his work in 1900 at a Paris conference; it so impressed Russell that Russell too was taken with the drive to render mathematics more concisely. The result was [[Principia Mathematica]] written with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. This treatise marks a watershed in modern literature where symbol became dominant.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Peano's ''Formulario Mathematico'', though less popular than Russell's work, continued through five editions. The fifth appeared in 1908 and included 4200 formulas and theorems.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ricci-Curbastro and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] popularized the [[tensor index notation]] around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications|last=Ricci|first=Gregorio|author-link=Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|last2=Levi-Civita|first2=Tullio|journal=Mathematische Annalen|publisher=Springer|volume=54|issue=1–2|date=March 1900|pages=125–201|doi=10.1007/BF01454201|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u21237446l22rgg7/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of this period, [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of various geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]]. [[Georg Cantor]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Inventor of [[set theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; would introduce the [[Aleph number|aleph symbol]] for [[cardinal number]]s of transfinite sets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Transfinite arithmetic'' is the generalization of [[elementary arithmetic]] to [[infinity|infinite]] quantities like [[infinite sets]]; See [[Transfinite number]]s, [[Transfinite induction]], and [[Transfinite interpolation]]. See also [[Ordinal arithmetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter ω ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today in [[ordinal notation]] of a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet which names an [[ordinal number]] according to some scheme which gives meaning to the language. [[Cantor's theorem|His theory]] created a [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|great deal of controversy]]. Cantor would, in his study of [[Fourier series]], consider point sets in [[Euclidean space]].

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] would in [[physical chemistry]] introduce [[middle dot]] for [[dot product]] and the [[multiplication sign]] for [[cross product]]s. He would also supply notation for the scalar and vector products, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''. In 1904, [[Ernst Zermelo]] promotes [[axiom of choice]] and his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].&lt;ref name="Zermelo, 1904"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526 |format=reprint|title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16|doi=10.1007/BF01445300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertrand Russell would shortly afterward introduce [[logical disjunction]] ([[Logical disjunction|OR]]) in 1906.

After 1907, mathematicians&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as [[Max Dehn]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]], and others.&lt;/ref&gt; studied knots from the point of view of the [[knot group]] and invariants from [[Homology (mathematics)|homology theory]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as the [[Alexander polynomial]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Joseph Wedderburn]]'s structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional [[algebra over a field|algebras over a field]]. Also in 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed "definite" property and the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. In 1910 [[Ernst Steinitz]] published the influential paper ''Algebraic Theory of Fields''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;(German: Algebraische Theorie der Körper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this paper Steinitz axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field theoretic concepts like [[prime field]], [[perfect field]] and the [[transcendence degree]] of a [[field extension]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Steinmetz would publish [https://archive.org/details/theoryandcalcul12steigoog ''Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena and Oscillations''].

[[File:Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer - restoration.jpg|thumbnail|Albert Einstein in 1921]]
[[Albert Einstein]], in 1916, introduced the [[Einstein notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The indices range over [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y = \sum_{i=1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
is reduced by the convention to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y = c_i x^i \,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  [[Ricci calculus]]&lt;/ref&gt; which summed over a set of [[index notation|indexed terms]] in a formula, thus exerting notational brevity. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] would create the [[contour integral]] sign in 1917. Also in 1917, [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] proposes [[axiom of regularity]]. In 1919, [[Theodor Kaluza]] would solve [[general relativity]] equations using [[Five-dimensional space|five dimensions]], the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1918).

In 1933, [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] introduces the ''[[Kolmogorov axioms]]''. In 1937, [[Bruno de Finetti]] deduced the "[[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|operational subjective]]" [[concept]].

====Mathematical symbolism====
{{see also|Category theory|Model theory|Table of logic symbols|Logic alphabet}}
Mathematical abstraction began as a process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept,&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected,&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume 1. By Sir Isaac Newton, John Machin. Pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]]. Two abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]]. Bertrand Russell,&lt;ref&gt;In The Scientific Outlook (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; said, "''Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say''". Though, one can substituted mathematics for real world objects, and wander off through equation after equation, and can build a concept structure which has no relation to reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics simplified and made attractive: or, The laws of motion explained. By Thomas Fisher. Pg 15. (cf. ''But an abstraction not founded upon, and not consonant with [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] and ''([[Logical truth|Logical]])'' [[Truth]], would be a [[falsity]], an [[insanity]].'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symbolic logic]] studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols.  The interest in this area springs from two sources.  First, the notation used in symbolic logic can be seen as representing the words used in [[philosophical logic]].  Second, the rules for manipulating symbols found in symbolic logic can be implemented on a [[computer|computing machine]]. Symbolic logic is usually divided into two subfields, [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].  Other logics of interest include [[temporal logic]], [[modal logic]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. The area of symbolic logic called [[propositional logic]], also called ''propositional calculus'', studies the properties of sentences formed from [[logical constant|constants]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Here a [[logical constant]] is a symbol in symbolic logic that has the same meaning in all models, such as the symbol "=" for "equals".&lt;br&gt;A ''constant'', in a mathematical context, is a [[Mathematical constant|number that arises naturally in mathematics]], such as π or e;  Such [[constant (mathematics)|mathematics constant]] value do not change. It can mean polynomial [[constant term]]  (the term of degree 0) or the [[constant of integration]], a free parameter arising in integration.&lt;br&gt; Related, the [[physical constant]] are a physical quantity generally believed to be universal and unchanging. [[Constant (programming)|Programming constants]] are a values that, unlike a variable, cannot be reassociated with a different value.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[logical operator]]s. The corresponding logical operations are known, respectively, as [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[material conditional]], [[biconditional]], and [[negation]].  These operators are denoted as [[reserved word|keywords]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though not an [[index term]], keywords are terms that represent information. A keyword is a word with special meaning (this is a semantic definition), while syntactically these are [[terminal symbol]]s in the phrase grammar. See [[reserved word]] for the related concept.&lt;/ref&gt; and by symbolic notation.

Some of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. This was created by [[George Boole]] in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; (AND), &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; (OR), and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; (''not'').  With these symbols, and letters to represent different [[truth value]]s, one can make logical statements such as &lt;math&gt;a\lor\lnot a=1&lt;/math&gt;, that is "(''a'' is true OR ''a'' is ''not'' true) is true", meaning it is true that ''a'' is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most of these symbols can be found in [[propositional calculus]], a [[formal system]] described as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}\ (\Alpha,\ \Omega,\ \Zeta,\ \Iota)&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the set of elements, such as the ''a'' in the example with Boolean algebra above.  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set that contains the subsets that contain operations, such as &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Zeta&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[inference rules]], which are the rules dictating how inferences may be logically made, and &lt;math&gt;\Iota&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[axioms]]. See also: [[Propositional calculus#propcalc table|Basic and Derived Argument Forms]].&lt;/ref&gt; Predicate logic, originally called ''predicate calculus'', expands on propositional logic by the introduction of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', or other lowercase letters&lt;br&gt;
Here a symbols that represents a quantity in a mathematical expression, a [[Variable (mathematics)|mathematical variable]] as used in many sciences.&lt;br&gt;
Variables can be symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed, known in computer science as a [[Variable (computer science)|variable reference]]. A ''variable'' can also be the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]] (e.g., a logical set of attributes). See also: [[Dependent and independent variables]] in statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and by sentences containing variables, called [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by an uppercase letter followed by a list of variables, such as P(''x'') or Q(''y'',''z'')&lt;br&gt;

While proving his [[incompleteness theorems]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] shows that [[Hilbert's program]] to find a complete and consistent set of [[axiom]]s for all [[mathematics]] is impossible, giving a contested negative answer to [[Hilbert's second problem]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]] created an alternative to the symbols normally used in logic.  He used [[Gödel number]]s, which were numbers that represented operations with set numbers, and variables with the prime numbers greater than 10.  With Gödel numbers, logic statements can be broken down into a number sequence.  Gödel then took this one step farther, taking the ''n'' prime numbers and putting them to the power of the numbers in the sequence.  These numbers were then multiplied together to get the final product, giving every logic statement its own number.&lt;ref&gt;Casti, John L. ''5 Golden Rules''. New York: MJF Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, take the statement "There exists a number ''x'' such that it is not ''y''".  Using the symbols of propositional calculus, this would become:  &lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(x=\lnot y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If the Gödel numbers replace the symbols, it becomes:&lt;math&gt;\{8, 4, 11, 9, 8, 11, 5, 1, 13, 9\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; There are ten numbers, so the ten prime numbers are found and these are: &lt;math&gt;\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; Then, the Gödel numbers are made the powers of the respective primes and multiplied, giving: &lt;math&gt;2^8\times3^4\times5^{11}\times7^9\times11^8\times13^{11}\times17^5\times19^1\times23^{13}\times29^9&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; The resulting number is approximately &lt;math&gt;3.096262735\times10^{78}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early 20th-century notation====
Abstraction of notation is an ongoing process and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Various [[set notation]]s would be developed for fundamental object [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Around 1924, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard Courant]] published "[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik|Methods of mathematical physics. Partial differential equations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gr. ''Methoden Der Mathematischen Physik''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Oskar Klein]] and [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]] proposed the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] to describe relativistic particles.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Klein–Gordon equation is:&lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac {m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi = 0. &lt;/math&gt; |cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formulation of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] describing radiation and matter interaction is due to [[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac]], who, during 1920, was first able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an [[atom]].&lt;ref name=dirac&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists came to believe that, in principle, it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles.

In 1931, [[Alexandru Proca]] developed the [[Proca equation]] ([[Euler–Lagrange equation]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is,&lt;br&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

In the 1930s, the double-struck capital Z for integer number sets was created by [[Edmund Landau]]. [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] created the double-struck capital Q for rational number sets. In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen made [[universal quantifier]]s. In 1936, [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] is stated by [[Alfred Tarski]] and proved.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] proposes the [[constructible universe]] in the paper "''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1077160/ The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis]''". [[André Weil]] and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] would develop the [[empty set]] sign in 1939. That same year, [[Nathan Jacobson]] would coin the double-struck capital C for [[complex number]] sets.

Around the 1930s, [[Voigt notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named to honor Voigt's 1898 work.&lt;/ref&gt; would be developed for [[multilinear algebra]] as a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order. [[Schoenflies notation|Schönflies notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named after [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]]&lt;/ref&gt; became one of two conventions used to describe [[point group]]s (the other being [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]). Also in this time, [[van der Waerden notation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spinoranalyse|author=Van der Waerden B.L.|journal=Nachr. Ges. Wiss.

[[Arend Heyting]] would introduce [[Heyting algebra]] and [[Heyting arithmetic]].

The arrow, e.g., →, was developed for [[function notation]] in 1936 by [[Øystein Ore]] to denote images of specific elements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Galois connection]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Oystein Ore would also write "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl_6BPp7S0AC Number Theory and Its History]".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1940, it took its present form, e.g., ''f: X → Y'', through the work of [[Witold Hurewicz]]. [[Werner Heisenberg]], in 1941, proposed the [[S-matrix theory]] of particle interactions.

[[File:Diracb.jpg|thumbnail|[[Paul Dirac]], pictured here, made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and [[quantum electrodynamics]].]]
[[Bra–ket notation]] ([[Dirac notation]]) is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s, composed of [[bracket|angle brackets]] and [[vertical bar]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s. It is so called because the [[inner product]] (or [[dot product]] on a complex vector space) of two states is denoted by a {{langle}}bra|ket{{rangle}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a left part, ⟨''φ''|, and a right part, |''ψ''⟩.

Bra–ket notation is widespread in [[quantum mechanics]]: almost every phenomenon that is explained using quantum mechanics—including a large portion of [[modern physics]]—is usually explained with the help of bra–ket notation. The notation establishes an encoded abstract representation-independence, producing a versatile specific representation (e.g., ''x'', or ''p'', or [[eigenfunction]] base) without much [[dict:ado|ado]], or excessive reliance on, the [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] of the [[linear space]]s involved. The overlap expression ⟨''φ''|''ψ''⟩  is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the [[Quantum state|state]] ''[[ψ]]'' to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state ''[[Φ#Use as a symbol|ϕ]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed by [[Richard Feynman]] for the study of [[Dirac field]]s in [[quantum field theory]].

In 1948, [[Valentine Bargmann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] proposed the [[relativistic wave equations|relativistic]] [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] to describe [[free particle]]s and the equations are in the form of multi-component [[spinor field]] [[wavefunction]]s. In 1950, [[W. V. D. Hodge|William Vallance Douglas Hodge]] presented "[[Hodge conjecture|The topological invariants of algebraic varieties]]" at the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians. Between 1954 and 1957, [[Eugenio Calabi]] worked on the [[Calabi conjecture]] for [[Kähler metric]]s and the development of [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s. In 1957, [[Tullio Regge]] formulated the mathematical property of potential scattering in the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That the scattering amplitude can be thought of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determine power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Mandelstam]], along with Regge, did the initial development of the [[Regge theory]] of strong interaction phenomenology. In 1958, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Richard Feynman]], along with [[George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], deduced the [[chiral|chiral structures]] of the [[weak interaction]] in physics. [[Geoffrey Chew]], along with others, would promote matrix notation for the [[strong interaction]], and the associated [[Bootstrapping (physics)|bootstrap principle]], in 1960. In the 1960s, [[set-builder notation]] was developed for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Also in the 1960s, tensors are abstracted within [[category theory]] by means of the concept of [[monoidal category]]. Later, [[multi-index notation]] eliminates conventional notions used in [[multivariable calculus]], [[partial differential equation]]s, and the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], by abstracting the concept of an integer [[index notation|index]] to an ordered [[tuple]] of indices.

In the modern mathematics of [[special relativity]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[Wave|wave theory]], the [[d'Alembert operator]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Box&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as the [[d'Alembertian]] or [[wave operator]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]] of [[Minkowski space]]. The [[Levi-Civita symbol]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as, "[[permutation symbol]]" (see: [[permutation]]), "[[antisymmetric symbol]]" (see: [[Self-complementary graph|antisymmetric]]), or "[[alternating symbol]]"&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[tensor calculus]].

After the full [[Lorentz covariance]] formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics, [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman]] were jointly awarded with a [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=nobel65&gt;{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contributions, and those of [[Freeman Dyson]], were about covariant and [[gauge invariant]] formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his [[Feynman diagram|diagrams]], initially seemed very different from the field-theoretic, [[Operator (physics)|operator]]-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but [[Freeman Dyson]] later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. [[Renormalization]], the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through [[integral]]s, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of [[quantum field theory]] and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Quantum electrodynamics has served as the model and template for subsequent quantum field theories. [[Peter Higgs]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], and others, [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]] independently showed how the [[weak nuclear force]] and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single [[electroweak force]]. In the late 1960s, the [[particle zoo]] was composed of the then known [[elementary particle]]s before the discovery of [[quarks]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for discovering it. The theory of the [[strong interaction]], to which many contributed, acquired its modern form around 1973–74. With the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]], a finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a "[[Standard Model|standard model]]" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for gravity, and which remains generally accepted within the domain to which it is designed to be applied. In the late 1970s, [[William Thurston]] introduced [[hyperbolic geometry]] into the [[Knot theory|study of knots]] with the [[geometrization conjecture|hyperbolization theorem]]. The [[orbifold notation]] system, invented by Thurston, has been developed for representing types of [[symmetry groups]] in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. In 1978, [[Shing-Tung Yau]] deduced that the [[Calabi conjecture]] have [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci flat]] metrics. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of [[string theory]] are abstractions of [[Einstein equations]] of [[General Relativity]].

The [[first superstring revolution]] is composed of mathematical equations developed between 1984 and 1986. In 1984, [[Vaughan Jones]] deduced the [[Jones polynomial]] and subsequent contributions from [[Edward Witten]], [[Maxim Kontsevich]], and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum field theory. According to [[string theory]], all particles in the "particle zoo" have a common ancestor, namely a [[String (physics)|vibrating string]]. In 1985, [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~gary/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Strominger]], and Edward Witten would publish "Vacuum configurations for superstrings"&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Physics B 258: 46–74, {{Bibcode|1985NuPhB.258...46C}}, {{doi|10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[tetrad formalism]] ([[tetrad (index notation)|tetrad index notation]]) would be introduced as an approach to [[general relativity]] that replaces the choice of a [[coordinate basis]] by the less restrictive choice of a local basis for the tangent bundle.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A locally defined set of four linearly independent [[vector field]]s called a [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=De Felice|first1=F.|last2=Clarke|first2=C.J.S. |title=Relativity on Curved Manifolds| year=1990|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Roger Penrose]] would propose [[Penrose graphical notation]] ([[tensor diagram notation]]) as a, usually handwritten, visual depiction of [[multilinear function]]s or [[tensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds" by V. G. Turaev (1994), page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose would also introduce [[abstract index notation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His usage of the Einstein summation was in order to offset the inconvenience in describing [[tensor contraction|contractions]] and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while maintaining explicit [[covariance]] of the expressions involved.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Edward Witten suggested [[M-theory]] and subsequently used it to explain some observed [[Duality (mathematics)|dualities]], initiating the [[second superstring revolution]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[String theory landscape]] and [[Swampland (physics)|Swampland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John H Conway 2005 (cropped).jpg|thumb|John H Conway, prolific mathematician of notation.]]
[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] would further various notations, including the [[Conway chained arrow notation]], the [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation of knot theory]], and the [[Conway polyhedron notation]]. The [[Coxeter notation]] system classifies symmetry groups, describing the angles between with fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]]. It uses a bracketed notation, with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] more comprehensively defined it.

[[Combinatorics|Combinatorial]] [[LCF notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Devised by [[Joshua Lederberg]] and extended by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter]] and [[Robert Frucht|Frucht]]&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed for the representation of [[cubic graph]]s that are [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1931, [[IBM]] produces the [[List of IBM products|IBM 601 Multiplying Punch]]; it is an electromechanical machine that could read two numbers, up to 8 digits long, from a card and punch their product onto the same card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/601.html |title=The IBM 601 Multiplying Punch |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, [[Wallace Eckert]] used a rigged IBM 601 Multiplying Punch to automate the integration of differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/switch.html |title=Interconnected Punched Card Equipment |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=1935-10-24 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Alan Turing]] publishes "[http://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps210/Winter11/Papers/turing-1936.pdf On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]".&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 42 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;And, in 1938, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction" (Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, 2 (1937) 43 (6): 544–6, {{doi|10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann]], pioneer of the digital computer and of computer science,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Among von Neumann's other contributions include the application of [[operator theory]] to [[quantum mechanics]], in the development of [[functional analysis]], and on various forms of [[operator theory]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1945, writes the [[unfinished work|incomplete]] ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''. In 1962, [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] developed an integral part notation that became known as [[Iverson Notation]] for manipulating arrays that he taught to his students, and described in his book ''[[A Programming Language]]''. In 1970, [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]] proposed [[relational algebra]] as a [[relational model|relational model of data]] for [[database query language]]s.  In 1971, [[Stephen Cook]] publishes "[[P versus NP problem|The complexity of theorem proving procedures]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s within [[computer architecture]], [[Quote notation]] was developed for a representing number system of [[rational number]]s. Also in this decade, the [[Z notation]] (just like the [[APL (programming language)|APL language]], long before it) uses many non-[[ASCII]] symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in [[ASCII]] and in [[LaTeX]]. There are presently various [[C mathematical functions]] (Math.h) and [[numerical libraries]]. They are [[Library (computing)|libraries]] used in [[software development]] for performing [[numerical analysis|numerical]] calculations. These calculations can be handled by [[symbolic execution]]s; analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. [[Mathematica]] and [[SymPy]] are examples of computational software programs based on [[symbolic mathematics]].

[[File:Calabi yau.jpg|thumb|A section of a quintic Calabi–Yau three-fold ([[3D projection]]); recalling ''[[Lord Kelvin#Kelvin's vortex theory of the atom|atomic vortex theory]].'']]
In the history of mathematical notation, ideographic symbol notation has come full circle with the rise of computer visualization systems. The notations can be applied to abstract visualizations, such as for rendering some projections of a [[Calabi-Yau]] [[manifold]]. Examples of [[Information visualization|abstract visualization]] which properly belong to the mathematical imagination can be found in [[computer graphics]]. The need for such models abounds, for example, when the measures for the subject of study are actually [[random variable]]s and not really ordinary [[mathematical function]]s.

In [[mathematics]], an '''index set''' is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|title=Index Set|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IndexSet.html|work=Wolfram MathWorld|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James R.|title=Topology|volume= 2|location=Upper Saddle River|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if the elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' may be ''indexed'' or ''labeled'' by means of the elements of a set ''J'', then ''J'' is an index set.  The indexing consists of a [[surjective function]] from ''J'' onto ''A'' and the indexed collection is typically called an ''[[indexed family|(indexed) family]]'', often written as {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==

*An [[enumeration]] of a set {{math|''S''}} gives an index set &lt;math&gt;J \sub \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''f'' : ''J'' → ''S''}} is the particular enumeration of {{math|''S''}}.
*Any [[countably infinite]] set can be indexed by the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
*For &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[indicator function]] on {{math|''r''}} is the function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r\colon \mathbb{R} \rarr \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r (x) := \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ne r  \\ 1,  &amp; \mbox{if } x = r. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The set of all the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r&lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;!--(which happens to be a [[basis]] for the [[vector space]] of all functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;)--&gt; is an [[uncountable set]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other uses==
In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[cryptography]], an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that can sample the set efficiently; e.g., on input &lt;math&gt;1^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Kawasaki's theorem.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this example, the alternating sum of angles (clockwise from the bottom) is 90° &amp;minus; 45° + 22.5° &amp;minus; 22.5° + 45° &amp;minus; 90° + 22.5° &amp;minus; 22.5° = 0°. Since it adds to zero, the crease pattern may be flat-folded.]]
'''Kawasaki's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in the [[mathematics of paper folding]] that describes the [[crease pattern]]s with a single [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] that may be folded to form a flat figure. It states that the pattern is flat-foldable if and only if alternatingly adding and subtracting the angles of consecutive folds around the vertex gives an [[alternating series|alternating sum]] of zero.
Crease patterns with more than one vertex do not obey such a simple criterion, and are [[NP-hard]] to fold.

The theorem is named after one of its discoverers, [[Toshikazu Kawasaki]]. However, several others also contributed to its discovery, and it is sometimes called the '''Kawasaki–Justin theorem''' or '''Husimi's theorem''' after other contributors, Jacques Justin and [[Kôdi Husimi]].&lt;ref&gt;The name "Yasuji Husimi" appearing in {{harvtxt|Kawasaki|2005}} and sometimes associated with this theorem is a mistranslation of the kanji "康治" in Kôdi Husimi's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement of the theorem ==
A one-vertex [[crease pattern]] consists of a set of [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be [[mountain fold]]s or [[valley fold]]s. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.{{r|hull02}}

To fold flat, the number of creases must be even. This follows, for instance, from [[Maekawa's theorem]], which states that the number of mountain folds at a flat-folded vertex differs from the number of valley folds  by exactly two folds.{{r|hull}} Therefore, suppose that a crease pattern consists of an even number {{math|2''n''}} of creases, and let {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ⋯, α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the consecutive angles between the creases around the vertex, in clockwise order, starting at any one of the angles. Then Kawasaki's theorem states that the crease pattern may be folded flat if and only if the [[Alternating series|alternating sum and difference]] of the angles adds to zero:

:{{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ⋯ + α&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}

An equivalent way of stating the same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then the sum of the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees.{{r|charm}} However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero [[Defect (geometry)|defect]] at the vertex.{{r|hull02}}

==Local and global flat-foldability==
Kawasaki's theorem, applied to each of the vertices of an arbitrary crease pattern, determines whether the crease pattern is locally [[Flat-foldability|flat-foldable]], meaning that the part of the crease pattern near the vertex can be flat-folded. However, there exist crease patterns that are locally flat-foldable but that have no global flat folding that works for the whole crease pattern at once.{{r|hull}} {{harvs|first=Tom|last=Hull|authorlink=Tom Hull|year=1994|txt}} conjectured that global flat-foldability could be tested by checking Kawasaki's theorem at each vertex of a crease pattern, and then also testing [[bipartite graph|bipartiteness]] of an [[undirected graph]] associated with the crease pattern.{{r|hull94}} However, this conjecture was disproven by {{harvtxt|Bern|Hayes|1996}}, who showed that Hull's conditions are not sufficient. More strongly, Bern and Hayes showed that the problem of testing global flat-foldability is [[NP-complete]].{{r|bh96}}

==Proof==
To show that Kawasaki's condition necessarily holds for any flat-folded figure, it suffices to observe that, at each fold, the orientation of the paper is reversed. Thus, if the first crease in the flat-folded figure is placed in the plane parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis, the next crease must be rotated from it by an angle of {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the crease after that by an angle of {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (because the second angle has the reverse orientation from the first), etc. In order for the paper to meet back up with itself at the final angle, Kawasaki's condition must be met.{{r|hull|charm|roses|6.849}}

Showing that the condition is also a [[sufficient condition]] is a matter of describing how to fold a given crease pattern so that it folds flat. That is, one must show how to choose whether to make mountain or valley folds, and in what order the flaps of paper should be arranged on top of each other. One way to do this is to choose a number {{mvar|i}} such that the partial alternating sum
:{{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ⋯ + α&lt;sub&gt;2''i'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
is as small as possible. Either {{math|1=''i'' = 0}} and the partial sum is an [[empty sum]] that is also zero, or for some nonzero choice of {{mvar|i}} the partial sum is negative. Then, accordion fold the pattern, starting with angle {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;2''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and alternating between mountain and valley folds, placing each angular wedge of the paper below the previous folds. At each step until the final fold, an accordion fold of this type will never self-intersect. The choice of {{mvar|i}} ensures that the first wedge sticks out to the left of all the other folded pieces of paper, allowing the final wedge to connect back up to it.{{r|hull94}}

An alternative proof of sufficiency can be used to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the two creases on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two creases and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which crease. Then, glue the resulting flap of paper onto the remaining part of the crease pattern. The result of this gluing will be a crease pattern with two fewer creases, on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by [[mathematical induction]], repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two creases and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both creases. There are two ways to choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two creases. Therefore, any crease pattern with {{math|2''n''}} creases that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.{{r|hull03}}

==History==
In the late 1970s, [[Kôdi Husimi]] and [[David A. Huffman]] independently observed that flat-folded figures with four creases have opposite angles adding to {{pi}}, a special case of Kawasaki's theorem.{{r|hull10|nyt}} Huffman included the result in a 1976 paper on curved creases,{{r|huffman}} and
Husimi published the four-crease theorem in a book on origami geometry with his wife Mitsue Husimi.{{r|husimi}}
The same result was published even earlier, in a pair of papers from 1966 by S. Murata that also included the six-crease case and the general case of [[Maekawa's theorem]].{{r|murata}}

The fact that crease patterns with arbitrarily many creases necessarily have alternating sums of angles adding to {{pi}} was discovered by Kawasaki, by Stuart Robertson, and by Jacques Justin (again, independently of each other) in the late 1970s and early 1980s.{{r|bh96|hull10|robertson|justin|tmto|k89}}
Because of Justin's contribution to the problem, Kawasaki's theorem has also been called the Kawasaki–Justin theorem.{{r|orourke}}
The fact that this condition is sufficient—that is, that crease patterns with evenly many angles, alternatingly summing to {{pi}} can always be flat-folded—may have been first stated by {{harvtxt|Hull|1994}}.{{r|hull94}}

Kawasaki himself has called the result '''Husimi's theorem''', after Kôdi Husimi, and some other authors have followed this terminology as well.{{r|roses|kaino}} The name "Kawasaki's theorem" was first given to this result in ''Origami for the Connoisseur'' by [[Kunihiko Kasahara]] and Toshie Takahama (Japan Publications, 1987).{{r|hull}}

{{harvtxt|Hull|2003}} credits the lower bound of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the number of different flat-foldings of a crease pattern meeting the conditions of the theorem to independent work in the early 1990s by Azuma,{{r|azuma}} Justin,{{r|tmto}} and Ewins and Hull.{{r|hull03}}

Although Kawasaki's theorem completely describes the folding patterns that have flat-folded states, it does not describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, it may be necessary to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the [[dihedral angle]]s at each fold. For [[rigid origami]] (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.{{r|acdehklt}}

In mathematics, '''Legendre moments''' are a type of [[image moment]] and are achieved by using the [[Legendre polynomial]].  Legendre moments are used in areas of image processing including: pattern and object recognition, image indexing, line fitting, feature extraction, edge detection, and texture analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Deepika, C. et al. "Palmprint authentication using modified legendre moments", Procedia Computer Science, 2010, Vol.2, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–172&lt;/ref&gt;  Legendre moments have been studied as a means to reduce image moment calculation complexity by limiting the amount of information redundancy through approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Huazhong Shu, et al. "An Efficient Method for Computation
of Legendre Moments", Academic Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendre moments&lt;ref&gt;Pew-Thian Yap. "An Efficient Method for the Computation of Legendre Moments", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ( Volume: 27, Issue: 12, Dec. 2005 ) &lt;/ref&gt; ==
With order of ''m'' + ''n'', and object intensity function ''f''(''x'',''y''):
 
:&lt;math&gt; L_{pq}=\frac{(2m+1)(2n+1)} 4 \int\limits_{-1}^1 \int\limits_{-1}^1 P_m(x) P_n(y)f(x,y) \,dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'',''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...{{math|∞|size=150%}} with the ''n''th-order Legendre polynomials being:

:&lt;math&gt;P_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{k,n}x^k=\frac{(-1)^n}{2^n n!} \left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) [(1-x^2)^n] &lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_n(x) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^{D(n)}(-1)^k \frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^n k!(n-k)!(n-2k)!} x^{n-2k} \\[5pt]
&amp;  = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n(n!)^2}x^n-\frac{(2n-2)!}{2^n 1!(n-1)!(n-2)!} x^{n-2} + \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''(''n'') = floor(''n''/2). The set of Legendre polynomials {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')} form an orthogonal set on the interval [−1,1]: 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 P_n(x)P_m(x) \, dx = \frac{2}{2n+1}\delta_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;

A [[recurrence relation]] can be used to compute the Legendre polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)P_{n+1}(x)-(2n+1)xP_n(x)+nP_{n-1}(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

''f''(''x'',''y'') can be written as an infinite series expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials  [−1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'',''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_{mn}P_m(x)P_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30550">In [[mathematics]], a  '''Leibniz or Madhava series''' is any one of the series in a collection of [[infinite series]] expressions all of which are believed to have been discovered by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1350 – c.&amp;nbsp;1425), the founder of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] and later by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], among others. These expressions are the [[Maclaurin series]] expansions of the trigonometric [[sine]], [[cosine]] and [[arctangent]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], and the special case of the power series expansion of the arctangent function yielding a formula for computing π. The power series expansions of sine and cosine functions are respectively called ''Madhava's sine series'' and ''Madhava's cosine series''.  The power series expansion of the arctangent function is sometimes called ''Madhava–Gregory series''&lt;ref&gt;Reference to Gregory–Madhava series: {{Cite web|url=http://www.luigigobbi.com/EarliestKnownUsesOfSomeOfTheWordsOfMathematics/G-K.htm|title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reference to Gregory–Madhava series: {{Cite web|url=http://www.mat.uc.pt/~jaimecs/pessoal/hpm.html|title=History of Mathematics in the classroom|last=Jaime Carvalho e Silva|date = July 1994|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Gregory–Madhava series''. These power series are also collectively called  ''Taylor–Madhava series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Topic entry on complex analysis : Introduction|publisher=PlanetMath.org|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ComplexAnalytic2.html|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula for π is  referred to as ''Madhava–[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] series'' or ''Madhava–[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] series'' or [[Leibniz formula for pi]] or Leibnitz–Gregory–Madhava series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascal Sebah|author2=Xavier Gourdon|year=2004|title=Collection of series for pi|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/tkohl/teaching/spring2008/piSeries.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These further names for the various series are reflective of the names of the [[Western world|Western]] discoverers or popularizers of the respective series.

The derivations use many calculus related concepts such as summation, rate of change, and interpolation, which suggests that Indian mathematicians had a solid understanding of the basics of calculus long before it was developed in Europe. There is no evidence, however, that any of his ideas went out of Kerala. The [[calculus]] was still in its primitive stages and it would remain so until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leibniz]] entered the scene. Even though they had very basic ideas on the infinite series, Indian Mathematicians were not able to convert calculus to the modern problem solving tool that it is today.
No surviving works of Madhava contain explicit statements regarding the expressions which are now referred to as Madhava series. However, in the writing of later members of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] like [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] and [[Jyeshthadeva]] one can find unambiguous attributions of these series to Madhava. It is also in the works of these later astronomers and mathematicians one can trace the Indian proofs of these series expansions. These proofs provide enough indications about the approach Madhava had adopted to arrive at his series expansions.

Unlike most previous cultures, which had been rather nervous about the concept of infinity, Madhava was more than happy to play around with infinity, particularly infinite series. He showed how, although one can be approximated by adding a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth, etc., (as even the ancient Egyptians and Greeks had known), the exact total of one can only be achieved by adding up infinitely many fractions. But Madhava went further and linked the idea of an infinite series with geometry and trigonometry. He realized that, by successively adding and subtracting different odd number fractions to infinity, he could home in on an exact formula for π (this was two centuries before Leibniz was to come to the same conclusion in Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Mechanics Shaped the Modern World |edition=illustrated |first1=David |last1=Allen |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2013 |isbn=978-3-319-01701-3 |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 Extract of page 156]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madhava's series in modern notations==
In the writings of the mathematicians and astronomers of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]], Madhava's series are described couched in the terminology and concepts fashionable at that time. When we translate these ideas into the notations and concepts of modern-day mathematics, we obtain the current equivalents of Madhava's series. These present-day counterparts of the infinite series expressions discovered by Madhava are the following:

==Madhava series in "Madhava's own words"==
None of Madhava's works, containing any of the series expressions attributed to him, have survived. These series expressions are found in the writings of the followers of Madhava in the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]]. At many places these authors have clearly stated that these are "as told by Madhava". Thus the enunciations of the various series found in [[Tantrasamgraha]] and its commentaries can be safely assumed to be in "Madhava's own words". The translations of the relevant verses as given in the ''Yuktidipika'' commentary of [[Tantrasamgraha]]  (also known as ''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]] (circa. 1500 - 1560 CE)  are reproduced below. These are then rendered in current mathematical notations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.K.

==Madhava's sine series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's sine series is stated in verses 2.440 and 2.441 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses follows.

''Multiply the arc by the square of the arc, and take the result of repeating that (any number of times). Divide (each of the above numerators)  by the squares of the successive even numbers increased by that number and multiplied by the square of the radius.  Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above. These together give the jiva, as collected together in the verse beginning with "vidvan" etc. ''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''r'' denote the radius of the circle and ''s'' the arc-length.

*The following numerators are formed first:
:: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot s^2 ,\qquad s \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad s \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*These are then divided by quantities specified in the verse.
:: &lt;math&gt;s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}, \qquad s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2},\qquad s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2+6)r^2}, \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above to get ''jiva'':
::&lt;math&gt; \text{jiva}= s - \left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2} - \left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2} -\left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2+6)r^2}-\cdots\right]\right]\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let θ be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''r θ'' and ''jiva'' = ''r'' sin ''θ''. Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \frac{\theta^7}{7!} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
which is the infinite power series expansion of the sine function.

===Madhava's reformulation for numerical computation===
The last line in the verse &amp;prime;''as collected together in the verse beginning with "vidvan" etc.''&amp;prime; is a reference to a reformulation of the series introduced by Madhava himself to make it convenient for easy computations for specified values of the arc and the radius.
For such a reformulation, Madhava considers a circle one-quarter of which measures 5400 minutes (say ''C'' minutes) and develops a scheme for the easy computations of the ''jiva''&amp;prime;s of the various arcs of such a circle. Let ''R'' be the radius of a circle one-quarter of which measures C.
Madhava had already computed the value of π using his series formula for π.&lt;ref name="Raju"&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.K. Raju|title=Cultural foundations of mathematics: The nature of mathematical proof and the transmission of calculus from India to Europe in the 16 thc. CE|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilizations|location=Delhi|year=2007|series=History of Philosophy, Science and Culture in Indian Civilization|volume=X Part 4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this value of π, namely  3.1415926535922, the radius ''R'' is computed as follows:
Then

:''R'' = 2 &amp;times; 5400 / &amp;pi; = 3437.74677078493925 = 3437 [[arcminute]]s 44 [[arcsecond]]s  48 sixtieths of an [[arcsecond]] = 3437&amp;prime;  44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  48&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.

Madhava's  expression for ''jiva'' corresponding to any arc ''s'' of a circle of radius ''R'' is equivalent to the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{jiva } &amp; = s - \frac{s^3}{R^2(2^2+2)} + \frac{s^5}{R^4(2^2+2)(4^2+4)}- \cdots \\[6pt]
&amp; = s  - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^3 \left [   \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^3}{3!} 
- \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left [  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^5}{5!}
 - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left [  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^7}{7!} - \cdots  \right ]\right]\right].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Madhava now  computes the following values:

|-
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; R &amp;times; (π / 2)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; / 7!  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp; 05&amp;prime;&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp;  41&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ka-vī-śa-ni-ca-ya &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; R &amp;times; (π / 2)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; / 9!  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 33&amp;prime;&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp; 06&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; tu-nna-ba-la &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; R &amp;times; (π / 2)&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; / 11!  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; vi-dvān &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The ''jiva'' can now be computed using the following scheme:

:''jiva'' = ''s'' &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [ (2220&amp;prime; 39&amp;prime;&amp;prime;   40&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus;  (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (273&amp;prime;  57&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  47&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (16&amp;prime; 05&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  41&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ (33&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 06&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  (44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; ) ] ] ] ].

This gives an approximation of ''jiva'' by its Taylor polynomial of the 11'th order. It involves one division, six multiplications and five subtractions only. Madhava prescribes this numerically efficient computational scheme in the following words (translation of verse 2.437 in ''Yukti-dipika''):

''vi-dvān, tu-nna-ba-la, ka-vī-śa-ni-ca-ya, sa-rvā-rtha-śī-la-sthi-ro, ni-rvi-ddhā-nga-na-rē-ndra-rung . Successively multiply these five numbers in order by the square of the arc divided by the quarter of the circumference (5400&amp;prime;), and subtract from the next number. (Continue this process with the result so obtained and the next number.) Multiply the final result by the cube of the arc divided by quarter of the circumference and subtract from the arc.''

==Madhava's cosine series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's cosine series is stated in verses 2.442 and 2.443 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses follows.

''Multiply the square of the arc by the unit (i.e. the radius) and take the result of repeating that (any number of times). Divide (each of the above numerators) by the square of the successive even numbers decreased by that number and multiplied by the square of the radius. But the first term is (now)(the one which is) divided by twice the radius. Place the successive results so obtained one below the other and subtract each from the one above. These together give the śara as collected together in the verse beginning with stena, stri, etc. ''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''r'' denote the radius of the circle and ''s'' the arc-length.

*The following numerators are formed first:
:: &lt;math&gt;r \cdot s^2 ,\qquad r \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad r \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*These are then divided by quantities specified in the verse.
:: &lt;math&gt;r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2}, \qquad r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2},\qquad r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2-6)r^2}, \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above to get ''śara'':
:: &lt;math&gt; \text{sara}=   r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2} - \left [ r\cdot \frac{ s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2} -\left [ r\cdot \frac{ s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2-6)r^2}-\cdots\right]\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let ''θ'' be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''rθ'' and ''śara'' = ''r''(1 − cos ''θ''). Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
:&lt;math&gt;1 - \cos \theta = \frac{\theta^2}{2!}  -  \frac{\theta^4}{4!} + \frac{\theta^6}{6!} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
which gives  the infinite power series expansion of the cosine function.

===Madhava's reformulation for numerical computation===

The last line in the verse &amp;prime;''as collected together in the verse beginning with stena, stri, etc.''&amp;prime; is a reference to a reformulation introduced  by Madhava himself to make the series convenient for easy computations for specified values of the arc and the radius.
As in the case of the sine series, Madhava considers a circle one quarter of which measures 5400 minutes (say ''C'' minutes) and develops a scheme for the easy computations of the ''śara''&amp;prime;s of the various arcs of such a circle. Let ''R'' be the radius of a circle one quarter of which measures C. Then, as in the case of the sine series, Madhava gets
''R'' = 3437&amp;prime;  44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  48&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.

Madhava's  expression for ''śara'' corresponding to any arc ''s'' of a circle of radius ''R'' is equivalent to the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{jiva } &amp; = R\cdot \frac{s^2}{R^2(2^2-2)} - R\cdot \frac{s^4}{R^4(2^2-2)(4^2-4)}- \cdots \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[   \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2}{2!} 
- \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^4}{4!}
 - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^6}{6!} - \cdots  \right]\right]\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Madhava now  computes the following values:

&lt;/center&gt;

The ''śara'' can now be computed using the following scheme:

:''śara'' = (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (4241&amp;prime;  09&amp;prime;&amp;prime;   00&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus;  (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (872&amp;prime; 03&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 05 &amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [  (071&amp;prime; 43&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 24&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ (03&amp;prime; 09&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 37&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  [(05&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 12&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) − (s / C)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (06&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) ] ] ] ] ]

This gives an approximation of ''śara'' by its Taylor polynomial of the 12'th order. This also involves one division, six multiplications and five subtractions only. Madhava prescribes this numerically efficient computational scheme in the following words (translation of verse 2.438 in ''Yukti-dipika''):

''The six stena, strīpiśuna, sugandhinaganud, bhadrāngabhavyāsana, mīnāngonarasimha, unadhanakrtbhureva. Multiply by the square of the arc  divided by the quarter of the circumference and subtract from the next number. (Continue with the result and the next number.) Final result will be [[utkrama-jya]] (R versed sign).''

==Madhava's arctangent series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's arctangent series is stated in verses 2.206 &amp;ndash; 2.209 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses is given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.K.

''Now, by just the same argument, the determination of the arc of a desired sine can be (made). That is as follows: The first result is the product of the desired sine and the radius divided by the cosine of the arc. When one has made the square of the sine the multiplier and the square of the cosine the divisor, now a group of results is to be determined from the (previous) results beginning from the first.  When these are divided in order by the odd numbers 1, 3, and so forth, and when one has subtracted the sum of the even(-numbered) results from the sum of the odd (ones), that should be the arc. Here the smaller of the sine and cosine is required to be considered as the desired (sine). Otherwise, there would be no termination of results even if repeatedly (computed).''

''By means of the same argument, the circumference can be computed in another way too. That is as (follows): The first result should by the square root of the square of the diameter multiplied by twelve. From then on, the result should be divided by three (in) each successive (case). When these are divided in order by the odd numbers, beginning with 1, and when one has subtracted the (even) results from the sum of the odd, (that) should be the circumference.''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''s'' be the arc of the desired sine (''[[jya]]'' or ''jiva'') ''y''. Let ''r'' be the radius  and ''x'' be the cosine (''[[kojya|kotijya]]'').

*The first result is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y \cdot r}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Form the multiplier and divisor &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y^2}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Form the group pf results: 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*These are divided in order by the numbers 1, 3, and so forth:
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}, \qquad \frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*Sum of odd-numbered  results: 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x} + \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*Sum of even-numbered results:  
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{1}{7}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*The arc is now given by
::&lt;math&gt;s = \left(\frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x} + \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{1}{7}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let θ be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''r''&amp;theta;,  ''x'' = ''[[kotijya]]'' = ''r'' cos &amp;theta; and ''y'' = ''[[jya]]'' = ''r'' sin θ.
Then ''y'' / ''x'' = tan θ. Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
*&lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan \theta - \frac{\tan^3 \theta}{3} + \frac{\tan^5\theta}{5} - \frac{\tan^7 \theta}{7} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;.
Letting tan θ = ''q'' we finally have

*&lt;math&gt; \tan^{-1} q = q - \frac{q^3}{3} + \frac{q^5}{5} - \frac{q^7}{7} +  \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

===Another formula for the circumference of a circle===

The second part of the quoted text specifies another formula for the computation of the circumference ''c'' of a circle having diameter ''d''. This is as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; 
c= \sqrt{12 d^2} - \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3\cdot 3} + \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3^2 \cdot 5} - \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3^3 \cdot 7}+ \quad \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

Since  ''c'' =  &amp;pi; ''d'' this can be reformulated as a formula to compute π as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; 
\pi = \sqrt{12}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3\cdot3}+\frac{1}{3^2\cdot 5} -\frac{1}{3^3\cdot 7} +\quad \cdots\right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is obtained by substituting ''q'' = &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; (therefore ''θ'' = &amp;pi; / 6) in the power series expansion for tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''q'' above.

'''Mathematical diagrams''' are [[diagram]]s in the field of [[mathematics]], and diagrams using mathematics such as [[chart]]s and [[graph of a function|graphs]], that are mainly designed to convey mathematical relationships, for example, comparisons over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2993&amp;topic=all Working with diagrams] at LearningSpace.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of mathematical diagrams ==

=== Argand diagram ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|120px|Argand diagram.]]
A [[complex number]] can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an [[Argand diagram]]
The [[complex plane]] is sometimes called the ''Argand plane'' because it is used in ''Argand diagrams''. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.&lt;br/&gt;({{cite book |first1=Edmund Taylor |last1=Whittaker |first2=G.N. |last2=Watson |title=A Course of Modern Analysis: An Introduction to the General Theory of Infinite Processes and of Analytic Functions, with an Account of the Principal Transcendental Functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1927 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58807-2 |page=9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[root of a function|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

The concept of the complex plane allows a [[geometric]] interpretation of complex numbers. Under [[addition]], they add like [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s. The [[multiplication]] of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in [[polar coordinates]] — the magnitude or ''modulus'' of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the angle or ''argument'' of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|120px|left|Butterfly diagram]]

=== Butterfly diagram ===
In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a [[Butterfly diagram|butterfly]] is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

The [[butterfly diagram]] show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] as in the [[morpho|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name.

[[Image:5 lemma.svg|thumb|300px|A commutative diagram depicting the [[five lemma]]]]

=== Commutative diagram ===
{{Main|Commutative diagram}}

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a commutative diagram is a diagram of [[Object (category theory)|objects]], also known as vertices, and [[morphism]]s, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.

Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|left|120px|Hasse diagram.]]

=== Hasse diagrams ===
A [[Hasse diagram]] is a simple picture of a finite [[partially ordered set]], forming a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of the partial order's [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from ''x'' to ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. In this case, we say y [[covering relation|covers]] x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.

[[Image:TrefoilKnot 01.svg|right|thumb|120px|Knot diagram.]]

=== Knot diagrams ===
In [[Knot theory]] a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is [[Injective function|one-to-one]] except at the double points, called ''crossings'', where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Rolfsen |title=Knots and links |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Publish or Perish |isbn=978-0-914098-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, [[alternating knot]]s.

[[Image:Venn diagram cmyk.svg|thumb|120px|right|Venn diagram.]]

=== Venn diagram ===
A [[Venn diagram]] is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861733754/venn_diagram.html "Venn diagram"], Encarta World English Dictionary, North American Edition 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5ZATal Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] (1918). [https://archive.org/details/asurveyofsymboli00lewiuoft ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'']. Republished in part by Dover in 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voronoi centerlines skeleton.gif|left|thumb|120px|Voronoi centerlines.]]

=== Voronoi diagram ===
A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a special kind of decomposition of a [[metric space]] determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a [[discrete set]] of points. This diagram is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], also called a Voronoi [[tessellation]], a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites

[[Image:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|thumb|120px|right|Wallpaper group diagram.]]

=== Wallpaper group diagrams ===
A [[wallpaper group]] or ''plane symmetry group'' or ''plane crystallographic group'' is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional [[symmetry groups]], intermediate in complexity between the simpler [[frieze group]]s and the three-dimensional [[crystallographic group]]s, also called [[space group]]s. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.

=== Young diagram ===
A ''Young diagram'' or [[Young tableau]], also called [[Ferrers diagram]], is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). 
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|120px|left|Young diagram.]]
Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'', the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.

Each one has a different user interface. This picture shows clockwise from top left: An [[Arithmometer]], a [[Comptometer]], a Dalton adding machine, a Sundstrand and an [[Odhner Arithmometer]]]]

A '''mechanical calculator''', or '''calculating machine''', is a mechanical device used to perform automatically the basic operations of [[arithmetic]]. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small [[desktop computer]]s and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the [[electronic calculator]].

Surviving notes from [[Wilhelm Schickard]] in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of [[Napier's bones]], to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial,&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.

Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, [[Blaise Pascal]] decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. René Cassin, Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942), [[#NAT_MEP|Magazine Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted into his father's labour as [[tax collector]] in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required;&lt;ref name="INVENT"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin (1994)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; it was called [[Pascal's Calculator]] or Pascaline.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pascal's calculator#Competing designs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arithmometer|Thomas' arithmometer]], the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;Beside two arithmometer clone makers from Germany and England, the only other company to offer calculators for sale was Felt &amp; Tarrant from the USA which started selling their comptometer in 1887 but had only sold 100 machines by 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comptometer]], introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 133 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric motor]]s were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 23 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|Anita mk7]] from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.

[[Charles Babbage]] designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a [[steam engine]] to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime.  The first one was an ''automatic'' mechanical calculator, his [[difference engine]], which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz|Georg Scheutz]] became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG,Jean Marguin]] p. 171, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The second one was a ''programmable'' mechanical calculator, his [[analytical engine]], which Babbage started to design in 1834; "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern [[computer]]. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hyman, ''Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; making it infinitely programmable.&lt;ref&gt;"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937, [[Howard Aiken]] convinced [[IBM]] to design and build the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Mark I]], the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;&lt;ref&gt;[[#AIKEN|I. Bernard Cohen]], p. 66-67, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; when the machine was finished some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==

[[Image:Abacus 6.png|thumb|right|A Chinese [[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
{{further|Arithmetic|Abacus}}
{{quote | The desire to economize time and mental effort in arithmetical computations, and to eliminate [[human error|human liability to error]], is probably as old as the science of arithmetic itself. This desire has led to the design and construction of a variety of aids to calculation, beginning with groups of small objects, such as pebbles, first used loosely, later as counters on ruled boards, and later still as beads mounted on wires fixed in a frame, as in the abacus. This instrument was probably invented by the Semitic races and later adopted in India, whence it spread westward throughout Europe and eastward to China and Japan.&lt;br&gt;
After the development of the abacus, no further advances were made until John Napier devised his numbering rods, or [[Napier's Bones]], in 1617. Various forms of the Bones appeared, some approaching the beginning of mechanical computation, but it was not until 1642 that Blaise Pascal gave us the first mechanical calculating machine in the sense that the term is used today.|[[Howard Aiken]], Proposed automatic calculating machine, presented to IBM in 1937}}

{{further|Pascal's calculator#Precursors}}
A short list of other precursors to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical [[analog computer]]s which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (crank handle, weight, wheel, water...).  Before [[common era]], there are [[odometer]]s and the [[Antikythera mechanism]], an out of place, unique, geared [[astronomical clock]], followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical [[clock]]s, geared [[astrolabes]] and followed in the 15th century by [[pedometer]]s. These machines were all made of [[toothed gear]]s linked by some sort of carry mechanisms.  These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together by the rules of arithmetic.

==The 17th century==

===Overview===
The 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators, as it saw the invention of its first machines, including [[Pascal's calculator]], in 1642.&lt;ref name="INVENT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Please see [[Pascaline#Pascal versus Schickard]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] had invented a machine which he presented as being able to perform computations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible,&lt;ref&gt;"The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.", Pascal, Pensées [//www.bartleby.com/48/1/6.html Bartleby.com, Great Books online, Blaise Pasdcal, Thoughts]&lt;/ref&gt; but he wasn't successful in creating an industry.

{{quote |In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"&gt;[[#NAT_CHAP|Magazine Nature]], (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like [[Napier's bones]], [[Mathematical table#Tables of logarithms|logarithmic tables]] and the [[slide rule]] which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 128 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; until the production release of the [[arithmometer]] in the mid 19th century.
[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators -Detail.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|Four of Pascal's calculators and one machine built by Lépine in 1725,&lt;ref&gt;[[#350YEARS|From the calculating machine of Pascal to the computer]], p. 43 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]]]]

===Invention of the mechanical calculator===
[[Blaise Pascal]] invented a mechanical calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Machine_d%E2%80%99arithm%C3%A9tique (fr) La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat, p. 12 (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard's machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then ([[Pascal's calculator#Resetting the machine|method of {{nowrap|re-zeroing}}]]) propagate a carry right through the machine.&lt;ref name="CR_RESET"&gt;[[#COURRIER|Courrier du CIBP]], N°8, p. 9, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet it was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.&lt;ref name="NO_BLOC"&gt;"...''et si blocage il y avait, la machine était pratiquement inutilisable, ce qui ne fut jamais signalé dans les textes du XVIIIe siecle parmi ses défaults''" [[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 30 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Pascal's invention of the calculating machine, just three hundred years ago, was made while he was a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by seeing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions...|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"/&gt;}}

In 1672, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] started working on adding direct multiplication to what he understood was the working of Pascal's calculator. However, it is doubtful that he had ever fully seen the mechanism and the method could not have worked because of the lack of reversible rotation in the mechanism. Accordingly,  he eventually designed an entirely new machine called the [[Stepped Reckoner]]; it used his [[Leibniz wheel]]s, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706.&lt;ref name="LEIB"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 64-65 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist, it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century having been forgotten in an attic in the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name="LEIB"/&gt;
{{quote |In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 149 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz had invented his namesake wheel and the principle of a two motion calculator, but after forty years of development he wasn't able to produce a machine that was fully operational&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morar|first=Florin-Stefan|date=March 2015|title=Reinventing machines: the transmission history of the Leibniz calculator|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-for-the-history-of-science/article/reinventing-machines-the-transmission-history-of-the-leibniz-calculator/0EFE30C7B3975C7ADF10627D20CC3F07|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=48|issue=1|pages=123–146|doi=10.1017/S0007087414000429|issn=0007-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this makes Pascal's calculator the only working mechanical calculator in the 17th century. Leibniz was also the first person to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]].&lt;ref name="PINWHEEL"&gt;[[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173-181 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other calculating machines===
Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz were inevitably inspired by the role of clockwork which was highly celebrated in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator#schickard http://things-that-count.net]&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple minded application of interlinked gears was insufficient for any of their purposes.  Schickard introduced the use of a single toothed "mutilated gear" to enable the carry to take place.  Pascal improved on that with his famous weighted sautoir.  Leibniz went even further in relation to the ability to use a moveable carriage to perform multiplication more efficiently, albeit at the expense of a fully working carry mechanism.

{{quote|...I devised a third which works by springs and which has a very simple design. This is the one, as I have already stated, that I used many times, hidden in the plain sight of an infinity of persons and which is still in operating order. Nevertheless, while always improving on it, I found reasons to change its design...|Pascal|Advertisement Necessary to those who have curiosity to see the Arithmetic Machine, and to operate it (1645)&lt;ref&gt;Translated from "j'en composai une troisième qui va par ressorts et qui est très simple en sa construction. C'est celle de laquelle, comme j'ai déjà dit, je me suis servi plusieurs fois, au vu et su d'une infinité de personnes, et qui est encore en état de servir autant que jamais. Toutefois, en la perfectionnant toujours, je trouvai des raisons de la changer" [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]] Wikisource: La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When, several years ago, I saw for the first time an instrument which, when carried, automatically records the numbers of steps by a pedestrian, it occurred to me at once that the entire arithmetic could be subjected to a similar kind of machinery so that not only counting but also addition and subtraction, multiplication and division could be accomplished by a suitably arranged machine easily, promptly, and with sure results|Leibniz|on his calculating machine (1685)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173, (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The principle of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry calculating machine couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997) for Schikard's machine and the fact that the machines built by Burattini, Morland and Grillet were calculating clocks without a completely effective carry mechanism.&lt;/ref&gt; because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day do not have a machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).

* In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]], a German professor of Hebrew and Astronomy, designed a calculating clock which he drew on two letters that he wrote to [[Johannes Kepler]]. The first machine to be built by a professional was destroyed during its construction and Schickard abandoned his project in 1624. These drawings had appeared in various publications over the centuries, starting in 1718 with a book of Kepler's letters by [[Michael Gottlieb Hansch|Michael Hansch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html History of computer] (retrieved on 01/02/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1957 it was presented for the first time as a long lost mechanical calculator by Dr. Franz Hammer. The building of the first replica in the 1960s showed that Schickard's machine had an unfinished design and therefore wheels and springs were added to make it work.&lt;ref name="UNFINISHED"&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these replicas showed that the single tooth wheel, when used within a calculating clock, was an inadequate carry mechanism.&lt;ref name=NOTDO&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Pascal's Calculator#Pascal versus Schickard|see Pascal versus Schickard]]).  This did not mean that such a machine could not be used in practice, but the operator when faced with the mechanism resisting rotation, in the unusual circumstances of a carry being required beyond (say) 3 dials, would need to "help" the subsequent carry to propagate.
* Around 1643, a French clockmaker from Rouen, after hearing of Pascal's work, built what he claimed to be a calculating clock of his own design. Pascal fired all his employees and stopped developing his calculator as soon as he heard of the news.&lt;ref&gt;"The appearance of this small ''avorton'' disturbed me to the utmost and it dampened the enthusiasm with which I was developing my calculator so much that I immediately let go all of my employees..." translated from the French: "L'aspect de ce petit avorton me déplut au dernier point et refroidit tellement l'ardeur avec laquelle je faisais lors travailler à l'accomplissement de mon modèle qu'à l'instant même je donnai congé à tous les ouvriers..."&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only after being assured that his invention would be protected by a royal privilege that he restarted his activity.&lt;ref&gt;"But, later on, Lord Chancellor of France [...] granted me a royal privilege which is not usual, and which will suffocate before their birth all these illegitimate ''avortons'' which, by the way, could only be born of the legitimate and necessary alliance of theory and art." translated from the French: "Mais, quelque temps après, Monseigneur le Chancelier [...] par la grâce qu'il me fit de m'accorder un privilège qui n'est pas ordinaire, et qui étouffe avant leur naissance tous ces avortons illégitimes qui pourraient être engendrés d'ailleurs que de la légitime et nécessaire alliance de la théorie avec l'art"&lt;/ref&gt;  A careful examination of this calculating clock showed that it didn't work properly and Pascal called it an ''avorton'' (aborted fetus).&lt;ref&gt;"...a useless piece, perfectly clean, polished and well filed on the outside but so imperfect inside that it is of no use whatsoever." translated from the French: "...qu'une pièce inutile, propre véritablement, polie et très bien limée par le dehors, mais tellement imparfaite au dedans qu'elle n'est d'aucun usage"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All the quotes in this paragraph are found in (fr) [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Wikisource: Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1659, the Italian [[Tito Livio Burattini]] built a machine with nine independent wheels, each one of these wheels was paired with a smaller carry wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 Picture of Burattini's machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609022832/http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 |date=2010-06-09 }} Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 3179 (accessed on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.
* In 1666, [[Samuel Morland]] invented a machine designed to add sums of money,&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"&gt;[[#CHRONICLE|A calculator Chronicle, ''300 years of counting and reckoning tools'']], p. 12, IBM&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not a true adding machine since the carry was added to a small carry wheel situated above each digit and not directly to the next digit. It was very similar to Burattini's machine. Morland created also a multiplying machines with interchangeable disks based on Napier's bones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p.140 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35418 Picture of Morland multiplying machine] Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 679 (retrieved on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken together these two machines provided a capacity similar to that of the invention of Schickard, although it is doubtful that Morland ever encountered Schickard's calculating clock.
* In 1673, the French clockmaker [[René Grillet de Roven|René Grillet]] described in ''Curiositez mathématiques de l'invention du Sr Grillet, horlogeur à Paris'' a calculating machine that would be more compact than Pascal's calculator and reversible for subtraction. The only two Grillet machines known&lt;ref&gt;They belong to the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; have no carry mechanism, displaying three lines of nine independent dials they also have nine rotating napier's rod for multiplication and division. Contrary to Grillet's claim, it was not a mechanical calculator after all.&lt;ref&gt;"Grillet's machine doesn't even deserve the name of machine" translated from the French "La machine de Grillet ne mérite donc pas même le nom de machine", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.76 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
{{further|Pinwheel calculator|Leibniz wheel}}
The 18th century saw the first mechanical calculator that could perform a multiplication automatically; designed and built by [[Giovanni Poleni]] in 1709 and made of wood, it was the first successful calculating clock. For all the machines built in this century, division still required the operator to decide when to stop a repeated subtraction at each index, and therefore these machines were only providing a help in dividing, like an [[abacus]]. Both pinwheel calculators and Leibniz wheel calculators were built with a few unsuccessful attempts at their commercialization.

===Prototypes and limited runs===
* In 1709, the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] was the first to build a calculator that could multiply automatically.  It used a pinwheel design, was the first operational ''calculating clock'' and was made of wood;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/macchina_poleni/replica.asp Copy of Poleni's machine] (it) Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo Da Vinci. Retrieved 2010-10-04&lt;/ref&gt; he destroyed it after hearing that Antonius Braun had received 10,000 [[Rhenish guilder|Gulden]]s for dedicating a pinwheel machine of his own design to the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 93-94 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1725, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] certified a calculating machine derived from Pascal's calculator designed by Lépine, a French craftsman. The machine was a bridge in between Pascal's calculator and a calculating clock. The carry transmissions were performed simultaneously, like in a calculating clock, and therefore "the machine must have jammed beyond a few simultaneous carry transmissions".&lt;ref&gt;translated from the French: "De plus le report ne s'effectuant pas en cascade, la machine devait se bloquer au-delà de quelques reports simultanés", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin]], p.78 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1727, a German, [[Antonius Braun]], presented the first fully functional four operations machine to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Vienna]]. It was cylindrical in shape and was made of steel, silver and brass; it was finely decorated and looked like a renaissance table clock. His dedication to the emperor engraved on the top of the machine also reads "..to make easy to ignorant people, addition, subtraction, multiplication and even division".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.94-96 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1730, the French Academy of Sciences certified three machines designed by [[Hillerin de Boistissandeau]]. The first one used a single tooth carry mechanism which, according to Boistissandeau, wouldn't work properly if a carry had to be moved more than two places; the two other machines used springs that were gradually armed until they released their energy when a carry had to be moved forward. It was similar to Pascal's calculator but instead of using the energy of gravity Boistissandeau used the energy stored into the springs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG, Jean Marguin]], pages 80-81 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1770, [[Philipp Matthäus Hahn]], a German pastor, built two circular calculating machines based on Leibniz' cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Marguin, p.83 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic/attic_137.html Picture of Hahn's Calculator] IBM Collection of mechanical calculators&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. C. Schuster]], Hahn's brother in law, built a few machines of Hahn's design into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Jean Marguin, pages 84-86 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1775, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] of the [[United Kingdom]] designed a pinwheel machine. It was set in a rectangular box with a handle on the side. He also designed a machine using [[Leibniz wheel]]s in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FELT|Door E. Felt, p.15-16 (1916)]]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1777 Stanhope produced the ''Logic Demonstrator,'' a machine designed to solve problems in formal logic. This device marked the beginning of a new approach to the solution of logical problems by mechanical methods."&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"/&gt;
* In 1784, [[J. H. Müller|Johann-Helfrich Müller]] built a machine very similar to Hahn's machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/253/150/369/363/369|title=CNUM - 8KU54-2.5 : p.249 - im.253|website=cnum.cnam.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 19th century==

===Overview===
{{anchor|TotalMachinesBuilt}}
[[Luigi Torchi (inventor)| Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in [[1834]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/19thCentury/Torchi.html|title=History of Computers and Computing, Mechanical calculators, 19th century, Luiggi Torchi|website=history-computer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White ([[1822]])&lt;ref name="Roegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763737|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mechanical calculator industry started in 1851  [[Thomas de Colmar]] released his simplified [[Arithmometer|Arithmomètre]] which was the first machine that could be used daily in an office environment.

For 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;This is one third of the 120 years that this industry lasted&lt;/ref&gt; the arithmometer was the only mechanical calculator available for sale and was sold all over the world. By then, in 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html|title=www.arithmometre.org|website=www.arithmometre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two licensed arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883). Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century also saw the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his [[difference engine]], started in 1822, which was the first automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his [[analytical engine]], which was the first programmable calculator, using Jacquard's cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the [[mainframe computers]] built in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE&gt;"The calculating engines of English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) are among the most celebrated icons in the prehistory of computing. Babbage’s Difference Engine No.1 was the first successful automatic calculator and remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time. Babbage is sometimes referred to as "father of computing." The International Charles Babbage Society (later the Charles Babbage Institute) took his name to honor his intellectual contributions and their relation to modern computers."

===Desktop calculators produced===
[[Image:Close-up of the front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer with its movable result carriage extended]]
* In 1851, [[Thomas de Colmar]] simplified his [[arithmometer]] by removing the one digit multiplier/divider. This made it a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. The arithmometer was now adapted to the manufacturing capabilities of the time; Thomas could therefore manufacture consistently a sturdy and reliable machine.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah G., ''The Universal History of Numbers'', vol 3, page 127, The Harvill Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Manuals were printed and each machine was given a serial number. Its commercialization launched the mechanical calculator industry.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;Chase G.C.: ''History of Mechanical Computing Machinery'', Vol. 2, Number 3, July 1980, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  Banks, insurance companies, government offices started to use the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations, slowly bringing mechanical desktop calculators into the office.
* In 1878 Burkhardt, of Germany, was the first to manufacture a clone of Thomas' arithmometer. Until then Thomas de Colmar had been the only manufacturer of desktop mechanical calculators in the world and he had manufactured about 1,500 machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSerieEnglish.html Serial numbers and Years of manufacturing] www.arithmometre.org, Valéry Monnier&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually twenty European companies will manufacture clones of thomas' arithmometer until WWII.
* [[Dorr E. Felt]], in the U.S., patented the [[Comptometer]] in 1886. It was the first successful key-driven adding and calculating machine. ["Key-driven" refers to the fact that just pressing the keys causes the result to be calculated, no separate lever or crank has to be operated. Other machines are sometimes called "key-set".] In 1887, he joined with Robert Tarrant to form the Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The comptometer-type calculator was the first machine to receive an all-electronic calculator engine in 1961 (the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA mark VII]] released by Sumlock comptometer of the UK).
* In 1890 [[Viligodt Teofil Odner|W. T. Odhner]] got the rights to manufacture his calculator back from ''Königsberger &amp; C'', which had held them since it was first patented in 1878, but had not really produced anything. Odhner used his [[Saint Petersburg]] workshop to manufacture his calculator and he built and sold 500 machines in 1890. This manufacturing operation shut down definitively in 1918 with 23,000 machines produced. The [[Odhner Arithmometer]] was a redesigned version of the Arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar with a pinwheel engine, which made it cheaper to manufacture and gave it a smaller footprint while keeping the advantage of having the same user interface.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"&gt;[[#TROG|G. Trogemann]], pages: 39-45&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1892 Odhner sold the Berlin branch of his factory, which he had opened a year earlier, to ''Grimme, Natalis &amp; Co.''. They moved the factory to Braunschweig and sold their machines under the brand name of Brunsviga (Brunsviga is the Latin name of the town of Braunschweig).&lt;ref&gt;David J. Shaw: ''The Cathedral Libraries Catalogue'', The British Library and the Bibliographical Society, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of many companies which would sell and manufacture clones of Odhner's machine all over the world; eventually millions were sold well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"/&gt;
* In 1892, [[William Seward Burroughs I|William S. Burroughs]] began commercial manufacture of his printing adding calculator&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burroughs Corporation]] became one of the leading companies in the accounting machine and [[computer]] businesses.
* [[The Millionaire Calculator|The "Millionaire"]] calculator was introduced in 1893. It allowed direct multiplication by any digit - "one turn of the crank for each figure in the multiplier". It contained a mechanical product lookup table, providing units and tens digits by differing lengths of posts.  [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/Millionaire/Intro.htm] Another direct multiplier was part of the Moon-Hopkins billing machine; that company was acquired by Burroughs in the early 20th century.

=== Automatic mechanical calculators ===
[[Image:050114 2529 difference.jpg|thumb|The London Science Museum's working difference engine, built a century and a half after Charles Babbage's design.]]
* In 1822, [[Charles Babbage]] presented a small cogwheel assembly that demonstrated the operation of his [[difference engine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#WEB|James Essinger]], p.76 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical calculator which would be capable of holding and manipulating seven numbers of 31 decimal digits each. It was the first time that a calculating machine could work automatically using as input results from its previous operations.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE/&gt;  It was the first calculating machine to use a printer. The development of this machine, later called "Difference Engine No. 1," stopped around 1834.&lt;ref&gt;"The better part of my live has now been spent on that machine, and no progress whatever having been made since 1834...", Charles Babbage, quoted in [[#GENIUS|Irascible Genius]], 1964, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1847, Babbage began work on an improved difference engine design—his "Difference Engine No. 2."  None of these designs were completely built by Babbage. In 1991 the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] followed Babbage's plans to build a working Difference Engine No. 2 using the technology and materials available in the 19th century.
* In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz]] completed a working difference engine based on Babbage's design. The machine was the size of a piano, and was demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in [[Paris]] in 1855. It was used to create tables of [[logarithm]]s.
* In 1875, [[Martin Wiberg]] re-designed the Babbage/Scheutz difference engine and built a version that was the size of a sewing machine.

=== Programmable mechanical calculators ===
[[File:Analytical Engine (2290032530).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|Minimal but working demonstration part of the ''mill'' from the [[Analytical engine]], finished by Babbage's son around 1906]]
* In 1834, Babbage started to design his [[analytical engine]], which will become the undisputed ancestor of the modern [[mainframe computer]]&lt;ref&gt;"It is reasonable to inquire, therefore, whether it is possible to devise a machine which will do for mathematical computation what the [[automatic lathe]] has done for engineering. The first suggestion that such a machine could be made came more than a hundred years ago from the mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage's ideas have only been properly appreciated in the last ten years, but we now realize that he understood clearly all the fundamental principles which are embodied in modern digital computers" [[#FASTER|B. V. Bowden]], 1953, pp. 6,7&lt;/ref&gt; with two separate input streams for data and program (a primitive [[Harvard architecture]]), printers for outputting results (three different kind), processing unit (mill), memory (store) and the first ever set of programming instructions. In the proposal that [[Howard Aiken]] gave [[IBM]] in 1937 while requesting funding for the [[Harvard Mark I]] which became IBM's entry machine in the computer industry, we can read: "Few calculating machines have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him. In 1812 Babbage conceived the idea of a calculating machine of a higher type than those previously constructed to be used for calculating and printing tables of mathematical functions. ....After abandoning the ''difference engine'', Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an ''analytical engine'' of far higher powers than the ''difference engine''..."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Aiken, 1937, reprinted in [[#ORIGINS|The origins of Digital computers, Selected Papers]], Edited by [[Brian Randell]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the analytical engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli numbers]].  This is considered the first computer program.
* From 1872 until 1910, [[Henry Babbage]] worked intermittently on creating the mill, the "central processing unit" of his father's machine.  After a few setbacks, he gave in 1906 a successful demonstration of the mill which printed the first 44 multiples of pi with 29 places of figures.

=== Cash registers ===
{{further|Cash registers}}
The cash register, invented by the American saloonkeeper [[James Ritty]] in 1879, addressed the old problems of disorganization and dishonesty in business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.org.uk/page106.html NCR Retrospective website] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a pure adding machine coupled with a [[printer (computing)|printer]], a bell and a two-sided display that showed the paying party and the store owner, if he wanted to, the amount of money exchanged for the current transaction.

The cash register was easy to use and, unlike genuine mechanical calculators, was needed and quickly adopted by a great number of businesses.  "Eighty four companies sold cash registers between 1888 and 1895, only three survived for any length of time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cashregistersonline.com/history.asp History of the cash register] retrieved October, 05 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, 6 years after [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Patterson]] started [[NCR Corporation]], 20,000 machines had been sold by his company alone against a total of roughly 3,500 for all genuine calculators combined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TotalMachinesBuilt|See the number of machines built in 1890]] in this paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, NCR had built 200,000 cash registers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasscashregister.net/learn_more/articles/how_to_date_your_national_or_ncr_cash_register/ Dick and Joan's antique] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and there were more companies manufacturing them, compared to the "Thomas/Payen" arithmometer company that had just sold around 3,300&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html List of serial numbers by dates] arithmometre.org retrieved October 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Burroughs had only sold 1,400 machines.&lt;ref&gt;Before the computer, James W.

* In 1820, [[Thomas de Colmar]] patented the Arithmometer. It was a true four operation machine with a one digit multiplier/divider ([[The Millionaire Calculator|the millionaire calculator]] released 70 years later had a similar user interface&lt;ref&gt;A notable difference was that the Millionaire calculator used an internal mechanical product lookup table versus a repeated addition or subtraction ''until a counter was decreased down to zero and stopped the machine'' for the arithmometer&lt;/ref&gt;). He spent the next 30 years and 300,000 Francs developing his machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/Bibliotheque/BibNumerique/AmiDesSciences1856/AmidesSciences1856.pdf L'ami des Sciences 1856, p. 301] www.arithmometre.org (page retrieved on 09/22/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  This design was replaced in 1851 by the simplified arithmometer which was only an adding machine.
* From 1840, Didier Roth patented and built a few calculating machines, one of which was a direct descendant of [[Pascal's calculator]].
* In 1842, Timoleon Maurel invented the [[Arithmaurel]], based on the Arithmometer, which could multiply two numbers by simply entering their values into the machine.
* In 1845, [[Izrael Abraham Staffel]] first exhibited a machine that was able to add, subtract, divide, multiply and obtain a square root.

Although Grant never made much money from his calculating machines, his experiences in designing and constructing them led him to establish the highly successful ''Grant Gear Works'', which helped to pioneer the gear-cutting industry in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; The machine measured 13x5x7 inches and contained eighty working pieces made of brass and tempered steel.

=== Mechanical calculators reach their zenith ===
Two different classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations took place on the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.

The latter, type, rotary, had at least one main shaft that made one [or more] continuous revolution[s], one addition or subtraction per turn. Numerous designs, notably European calculators, had handcranks, and locks to ensure that the cranks were returned to exact positions once a turn was complete.

[[Image:Mechanical-Calculator.png|thumb|right|Mechanical calculator from 1914]]
The first half of the 20th century saw the gradual development of the mechanical calculator mechanism.

The Dalton adding-listing [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Addizionatrice_Dalton.jpg machine] introduced in 1902 was the first of its type to use only ten keys, and became the first of many different models of "10-key add-listers" manufactured by many companies.
[[File:Modern Addiator.jpg|thumb|left|100px|An [[Addiator]] can be used for addition and subtraction.]]
In 1948 the cylindrical [[Curta]] calculator, which was compact enough to be held in one hand, was introduced after being developed by [[Curt Herzstark]] in 1938. This was an extreme development of the stepped-gear calculating mechanism. It subtracted by adding complements; between the teeth for addition were teeth for subtraction.

From the early 1900s through the 1960s, mechanical calculators dominated the desktop computing market. Major suppliers in the USA included [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]], [[Monroe Calculator Company|Monroe]], and [[Marchant Calculator|SCM/Marchant]]. These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were ''full'' — each digit that could be entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.) One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, as well as some rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as [[Olivetti]], did make printing calculators.

In these machines, [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] made a calculator that also provided [[square root]]s, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically incremented the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered only in the last designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 [[Curta]] continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.

Typical European four-operation machines use the Odhner mechanism, or variations of it. This kind of machine included the ''Original Odhner'', Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although most of these were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.

Although Dalton introduced in 1902 first ten-key printing ''adding'' (two operations, the other being subtraction) machine, these feature were not present in ''computing'' (four operations) machines for many decades. Facit-T (1932) was the first 10-key computing machine sold in large numbers. [[Olivetti]] Divisumma-14 (1948) was the first computing machine with both printer and a 10-key keyboard.

Full-keyboard machines, including motor-driven ones, were also built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; &lt;!--Need more makers! --&gt;in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most of which were adding machines, many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt &amp; Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.

The basic mechanism of the Friden and Monroe was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a "stepped drum" or "stepped reckoner"). The Friden had an elementary reversing drive between the body of the machine and the accumulator dials, so its main shaft always rotated in the same direction. The Swiss MADAS was similar. The Monroe, however, reversed direction of its main shaft to subtract.

The earliest Marchants were pinwheel machines, but most of them were remarkably-sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [+] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in the photo of the Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.

In a Marchant, near the beginning of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears in the body of the machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!)

In any mechanical calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device moves the accumulator by the number of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).

However, two different basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds corresponding to the digit being added or subtracted; a [1] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a [9], the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for [1] is closest to the pivot, of course.
For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much like that in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.

The Marchant, however, has, for every one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio "preselector transmission" with its output spur gear at the top of the machine's body; that gear engages the accumulator gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.

Given that nine ratios per column implies significant complexity, a Marchant contains a few hundred individual gears in all, many in its accumulator. Basically, the accumulator dial has to rotate 36 degrees (1/10 of a turn) for a [1], and 324 degrees (9/10 of a turn) for a [9], not allowing for incoming carries. At some point in the gearing, one tooth needs to pass for a [1], and nine teeth for a [9]. There is no way to develop the needed movement from a driveshaft that rotates one revolution per cycle with few gears having practical (relatively small) numbers of teeth.

The Marchant, therefore, has three driveshafts to feed the little transmissions. For one cycle, they rotate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/12 of a revolution. [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/MarchantDRX/Actuator.htm]. The 1/2-turn shaft carries (for each column) gears with 12, 14, 16, and 18 teeth, corresponding to digits 6, 7, 8, and 9. The 1/4-turn shaft carries (also, each column) gears with 12, 16, and 20 teeth, for 3, 4, and 5. Digits [1] and [2] are handled by 12 and 24-tooth gears on the 1/12-revolution shaft. Practical design places the 12th-rev. shaft more distant, so the 1/4-turn shaft carries freely-rotating 24 and 12-tooth idler gears. For subtraction, the driveshafts reversed direction.

In the early part of the cycle, one of five pendants moves off-center to engage the appropriate drive gear for the selected digit.

Some machines had as many as 20 columns in their full keyboards. The monster in this field was the ''Duodecillion'' made by [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] for exhibit purposes.

For sterling currency, £/s/d (and even farthings), there were variations of the basic mechanisms, in particular with different numbers of gear teeth and accumulator dial positions. To accommodate shillings and pence, extra columns were added for the tens digit[s], 10 and 20 for shillings, and 10 for pence. Of course, these functioned as radix-20 and radix-12 mechanisms.

A variant of the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early vacuum-tube (valve) binary computers for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.)

As well, there was a twin Marchant, comprising two pinwheel Marchants with a common drive crank and reversing gearbox.[http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/the_twin_marchant.html] Twin machines were relatively rare, and apparently were used for surveying calculations. At least one triple machine was made.

The Facit calculator, and one similar to it, are basically pinwheel machines, but the array of pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins to  extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector as well as the same pins for 6 through 9.

The keys operate cams that operate a swinging lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam that is part of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key's cam) rotates the pin-positioning cam to extend the necessary number of pins.[http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/FacitC1-13/C113.htm#Rotor]

Stylus-operated adders with circular slots for the stylus, and side-by -side wheels, as made by Sterling Plastics (USA), had an ingenious anti-overshoot mechanism to ensure accurate carries.

=== The end of an era ===
Mechanical calculators continued to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, with many of the manufacturers closing down or being taken over. [[Comptometer]] type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a [[Comptometer]] quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator put an end to the [[Comptometer]]. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the [[slide rule]] had become obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">A '''minimax theorem''' is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the [[max–min inequality]] is also an equality. 
The first theorem in this sense is [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s minimax theorem from 1928, which was considered the starting point of [[game theory]]. 
Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Du|editor1-first=Ding-Zhu|editor2-last=Pardalos|editor2-first=Panos M.|title=Minimax and Applications|date=1995|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461335573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Felix|last2=Brill|first2=Markus|last3=Suksompong|first3=Warut|year=2016|title=An ordinal minimax theorem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825615001670|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=95|pages=107–112|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2015.12.010|arxiv=1412.4198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimax theorem was first proven and published in 1928 by [[John von Neumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Von Neumann |first=J. |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]] |volume=100 |year=1928 |issue= |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying "''As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games … without that theorem … I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved''".&lt;ref name=Casti&gt;{{cite book

Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; be [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex set|convex]] sets. If &lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is convex-concave, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,y):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is convex for fixed &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot):Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is concave for fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in X}\max_{y\in Y} f(x,y)=\max_{y\in Y}\min_{x\in X}f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Music theory]]''' has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern [[mathematics]], yet the basis of musical [[sound]] can be described mathematically (in [[acoustics]]) and exhibits "a remarkable array of number properties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Smith Brindle]], ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elements of music]] such as its [[Musical form|form]], [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (music)|metre]], the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of its [[Musical note|notes]] and the [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of its [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] can be related to the [[Chronometry|measurement of time]] and [[frequency]], offering ready [[Analogical models|analogies]] in [[geometry]].   

The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, Chapter 6 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric - Math and Music: Harmonious Connections |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED388615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]])&lt;ref name="purwins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles of Pitch Classes Circularity of Relative Pitch and Key-Experiments, Models, Computational Music Analysis, and Perspectives|pages=22-24|year=2005|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~purwins/purwinsPhD.pdf|last1=Purwins | first1=Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Plato (trans. Desmond Lee) ''The Republic'', Harmondsworth Penguin 1974, page 340, note.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that "all nature consists of [[harmony]] arising out of numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Plato]], harmony was considered a fundamental branch of [[physics]], now known as [[musical acoustics]]. Early [[Indian music scale|Indian]] and [[Chinese musicology|Chinese]] theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of [[harmonic]]s and [[rhythm]]s were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou, ''Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales'', Mushiram Manoharlal 1999, Chapter 1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]], like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time, rhythm and meter==

Without the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[Beat (music)|accent]], [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] and duration – music would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whittall, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 2002, Article: ''Rhythm''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern musical use of terms like [[Meter (music)|meter]] and [[bar (music)|measure]] also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and [[Frequency|periodicity]] that is fundamental to physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Виноград, Многообразие проявлений музыкального метра (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2013)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0/isbn/978-3-659-48005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
{{Main|Musical form}}
Musical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term "plan" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order.&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Holst, ''The ABC of Music'', Oxford 1963, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of form known as [[Binary form|binary]] and [[Ternary form|ternary]] ("twofold" and "threefold") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Frequency and harmony==
[[Image:Chladini.Diagrams.for.Quadratic.Plates.svg|thumb|220px|Chladni figures produced by sound vibrations in fine powder on a square plate. ([[Ernst Chladni]], ''Acoustics'', 1802)]]
A [[musical scale]] is a discrete set of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the [[diatonic scale]] but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the [[octave]]. The [[octave]] of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.

Succeeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called '''doh''' or '''A''' or '''Sa''', as the case may be).

When expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' spans from 110&amp;nbsp;Hz to 220&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=110&amp;nbsp;Hz). The next octave will span from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=220&amp;nbsp;Hz). The third octave spans from 440&amp;nbsp;Hz to 880&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=440&amp;nbsp;Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.

Because we are often interested in the relations or [[ratio]]s between the pitches (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written '''1/1'''), generally a note which functions as the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the scale. For interval size comparison, [[cent (music)|cent]]s are often used.

==Tuning systems==
{{Main|Musical tuning|Musical temperament}}

There are two main families of tuning systems: [[equal temperament]] and [[just tuning]]. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are [[irrational number]]s. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by [[rational number]]s, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.

One major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in [[Beat (acoustics)|acoustical beat]] when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of [[consonance and dissonance]]. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every [[octave]], which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.

Below are [[Ogg Vorbis]] files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.
*[[Media:Comparison 550Hz - 554Hz.ogg|Two sine waves played consecutively]] – this sample has half-step at 550&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale), followed by a half-step at 554.37&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the equal temperament scale).
*[[Media:Major third comparison.ogg|Same two notes, set against an A440 pedal]] – this sample consists of a "[[Dyad (music)|dyad]]". The lower note is a constant A (440&amp;nbsp;Hz in either scale), the upper note is a C{{music|#}} in the equal-tempered scale for the first 1", and a C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale for the last 1". [[Beat (acoustics)|Phase]] differences make it easier to pick the transition than in the previous sample.

===Just tunings===
[[5-limit tuning]], the most common form of [[just intonation]], is a system of tuning using tones that are [[regular number]] [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This was one of the scales [[Johannes Kepler]] presented in his [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseofmusick00malc|title=A treatise of musick, speculative, practical and historical|first1=Alexander|last1=Malcolm|first2=Mr (Joseph)|last2=Mitchell|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed for the author|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by theorist [[Jose Wuerschmidt]] in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.

American composer [[Terry Riley]] also made use of the inverted form of it in his "Harp of New Albion". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no [[chord progression]]: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Montagu, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, Article: ''just intonation''.&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally "two tones", and is (9:8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9:8.

The just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a [[syntonic comma]], 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus|Carl]] {{harvtxt|Dahlhaus|1990|p=187}}, "the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals."

Western [[common practice period|common practice music]] usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of [[well temperament]] or be constructed as a [[regular tuning and temperament|regular temperament]], either some form of [[equal temperament]] or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of [[meantone temperament]]. For example, the root of chord '''ii''', if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]] or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.

===Equal temperament tunings===
In [[equal temperament]], the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone [[Arab tone system]]), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament [[chromatic scale]]. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.

For the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the [[twelfth root of two]] so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as [[musical keyboard]]s. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.

Equally tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The [[19 equal temperament]], first proposed and used by [[Guillaume Costeley]] in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. [[Quarter tone|Twenty-four equal temperament]], with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and [[Arabic maqam#Notation|notation]] of [[Arabic music]]. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to [[Rational number|rational ratios]], as opposed to the [[Irrational number|irrational ratios]] of equally tempered systems.&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touma|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-931340-88-8|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any analog to the equally tempered [[quarter tone]] is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or [[neutral second]], frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]], as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian [[Habib Hassan Touma]] has written that "the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture."&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"/&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==
===Set theory===
{{Main|Set theory (music)}}
Musical set theory uses the language of mathematical [[set theory]] in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.

===Abstract algebra===
{{Main|Abstract algebra}}
Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algebra of Tonal Functions. |url=http://sonantometry.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic Limit|url=https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Harmonic+Limit||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformational theory]] is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]]. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a [[Grassmannian]].

The [[chromatic scale]] has a free and transitive action of the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, with the action being defined via [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a [[torsor]] for the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Real and complex analysis===
Real and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to the study of equal divisions of the octave.[https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Riemann+Zeta+Function+and+Tuning]

[[Probability theory]] and [[statistics]] have some commonly used conventions, in addition to standard [[mathematical notation]] and [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]].

==Probability theory==
* [[Random variable]]s are usually written in [[upper case]] roman letters: ''X'', ''Y'', etc.
* Particular realizations of a random variable are written in corresponding [[lower case]] letters. For example, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; could be a [[random sample|sample]] corresponding to the random variable ''X''. A cumulative probability is formally written &lt;math&gt;P(X\le x) &lt;/math&gt; to differentiate the random variable from its realization.
* The probability is sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P} &lt;/math&gt; to distinguish it from other functions and measure ''P'' so as to avoid having to define " ''P'' is a probability" and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(X\in A) &lt;/math&gt; is short for &lt;math&gt;P(\{\omega \in\Omega: X(\omega) \in A\})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the event space and &lt;math&gt;X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable. &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt; notation is used alternatively.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cap B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability that events ''A'' and ''B'' both occur. The [[joint probability distribution]] of random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;P(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt;, while joint probability mass function or probability density function as &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and joint cumulative distribution function as &lt;math&gt;F(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cup B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability of either event ''A'' or event ''B'' occurring ("or" in this case means [[inclusive or|one or the other or both]]).
*[[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebras]] are usually written with uppercase [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; for the set of sets on which we define the probability ''P'')
*[[Probability density function]]s (pdfs) and [[probability mass function]]s are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;f_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Cumulative distribution function]]s (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Survival function]]s or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an [[overbar]] over the symbol for the cumulative:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x) =1-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or denoted as &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
*In particular, the pdf of the [[standard normal distribution]] is denoted  by &amp;phi;(''z''), and its cdf by &amp;Phi;(''z'').
*Some common operators: 
:* E[''X''] : [[expected value]] of ''X''
:* var[''X''] : [[variance]] of ''X''
:* cov[''X'', ''Y''] : [[covariance]] of ''X'' and ''Y''
* X is independent of Y is often written &lt;math&gt;X \perp Y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y&lt;/math&gt;, and X is independent of Y given W is often written 
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y \,|\, W &lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp Y \,|\, W&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''[[conditional probability]]'', is the probability of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''given'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''after'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is observed.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

==Statistics==
*Greek letters (e.g. &amp;theta;, &amp;beta;) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters (population parameters).
*A tilde (~) denotes "has the probability distribution of".
*Placing a hat, or caret,  over a true parameter denotes an [[estimator]] of it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[arithmetic mean]] of a series of values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by placing an "[[overbar]]" over the symbol, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "''x'' bar".
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] statistics are given below:
**the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;,
**the [[sample variance]] ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the [[sample standard deviation]] ''s'',
**the [[Pearson correlation coefficient|sample correlation coefficient]] ''r'',
**the sample cumulants ''k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Statistical population|population]] parameters are given below:
**the population mean ''&amp;mu;'',
**the population variance ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the population standard deviation ''&amp;sigma;'',
**the population [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation]] ''&amp;rho;'',
**the population [[cumulant]]s ''&amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*&lt;math&gt;x_{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is used for the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[order statistic]], where &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample minimum and &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample maximum from a total sample size ''n''.

==Critical values==
The &amp;alpha;-level upper [[critical value]] of a [[probability distribution]] is the value exceeded with probability &amp;alpha;, that is, the value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 &amp;minus; &amp;alpha; where ''F'' is the cumulative distribution function. There are standard notations for the  upper critical values of some commonly used distributions in statistics:
*''z''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''z''(&amp;alpha;) for the [[Standard normal distribution]]
*''t''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''t''(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;) for the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with &amp;nu; [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]
*&lt;math&gt;{\chi_{\alpha,\nu}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{\chi}^{2}(\alpha,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; for the [[chi-squared distribution]] with &amp;nu; degrees of freedom
*&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha,\nu_1,\nu_2}&lt;/math&gt; or F(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the [[F-distribution]] with &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom

==Linear algebra==
*[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] are usually denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g. '''A'''. 
*[[Column vector]]s are usually denoted by boldface lowercase letters, e.g. '''x'''.
*The [[transpose]] operator is denoted by either a superscript T (e.g. '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;) or a [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (e.g. '''A'''&amp;prime;).
*A [[row vector]] is written as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; or '''x'''&amp;prime;.

Common abbreviations include:
*'''a.e.''' [[almost everywhere]]
*'''a.s.''' [[almost surely]]

In mathematics, for example in the study of statistical properties of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], a '''null model''' is type of random object that matches one specific object in some of its features, or more generally satisfies a collection of constraints, but which is otherwise taken to be an unbiasedly random structure. The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable [[null hypothesis]] for the behavior of the system under investigation.

One null model of utility in the study of [[complex networks]] is that proposed by Newman and Girvan, consisting of a randomized version of an original graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, produced through edges being rewired at random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M.E.J|first=Newman|author2=M.Girvan |title=Finding and evaluating community structure in networks|journal=Phys. Rev. E|year=2004|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.1103/physreve.69.026113 |arxiv=cond-mat/0308217|bibcode=2004PhRvE..69b6113N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The null model is the basic concept behind the definition of [[Modularity (networks)|modularity]], a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters. In particular, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a specific community partition &lt;math&gt;\sigma:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,b\}&lt;/math&gt; (an assignment of a community-index &lt;math&gt;\sigma(v)&lt;/math&gt; (here taken as an integer from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) to each vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt; in the graph), the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from/to each pair of communities, from that expected in a graph that is completely random in all respects other than the set of degrees of each of the vertices (the [[degree sequence]]). In other words, the modularity contrasts the exhibited community structure in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with that of a null model, which in this case is the [[configuration model]] (the maximally random graph subject to a constraint on the degree of each vertex).

The '''On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences''' ('''OEIS'''), also cited simply as '''Sloane's''', is an online database of [[integer sequence]]s. It was created and maintained by [[Neil Sloane]] while a researcher at [[AT&amp;T Labs]]. Foreseeing his retirement from AT&amp;T Labs in 2012 and the need for an independent foundation, Sloane agreed to transfer the [[intellectual property]] and hosting of the OEIS to the '''OEIS Foundation''' in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oeisf.org/index.html#IPXFER Transfer of IP in OEIS to The OEIS Foundation Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sloane continues to be involved in the OEIS in his role as President of the OEIS Foundation.

OEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional [[mathematician]]s and [[recreational mathematics|amateurs]], and is widely cited. {{As of|2018|09|url=https://oeis.org/}} it contains over 300,000 sequences, making it the largest database of its kind.

Each entry contains the leading terms of the sequence, [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s, mathematical motivations, literature links, and more, including the option to generate a [[Graph of a function|graph]] or play a [[Computer music|musical]] representation of the sequence. The database is [[Search engine (computing)|searchable]] by keyword and by [[subsequence]].

==History==
[[Neil Sloane]] started collecting integer sequences as a graduate student in 1965 to support his work in [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Gleick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/27/science/in-a-random-world-he-collects-patterns.html |title=In a 'random world,' he collects patterns |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 27, 1987 |page=C1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database was at first stored on [[punched card]]s. He published selections from the database in book form twice:
#'''''A Handbook of Integer Sequences''''' (1973, {{isbn|0-12-648550-X}}), containing 2,372 sequences in [[Lexicographical order|lexicographic order]] and assigned numbers from 1 to 2372.
#'''''The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences''''' with [[Simon Plouffe]] (1995, {{isbn|0-12-558630-2}}), containing 5,488 sequences and assigned M-numbers from M0000 to M5487.  The Encyclopedia includes the references to the corresponding sequences (which may differ in their few initial terms) in ''A Handbook of Integer Sequences'' as N-numbers from N0001 to N2372 (instead of 1 to 2372.) The Encyclopedia includes the A-numbers that are used in the OEIS, whereas the Handbook did not.
These books were well received and, especially after the second publication, mathematicians supplied Sloane with a steady flow of new sequences. The collection became unmanageable in book form, and when the database had reached 16,000 entries Sloane decided to go online—first as an e-mail service (August 1994), and soon after as a web site (1996). As a spin-off from the database work, Sloane founded the ''[[Journal of Integer Sequences]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/ Journal of Integer Sequences]
 ({{ISSN|1530-7638}})&lt;/ref&gt;
The database continues to grow at a rate of some 10,000 entries a year.
Sloane has personally managed 'his' sequences for almost 40 years, but starting in 2002, a board of associate editors and volunteers has helped maintain the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = //oeis.org/wiki/Editorial_Board | title = Editorial Board | work = On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, Sloane celebrated the addition of the 100,000th sequence to the database, {{OEIS link|A100000}}, which counts the marks on the [[Ishango bone]]. In 2006, the user interface was overhauled and more advanced search capabilities were added. In 2010 an [//oeis.org/wiki/ OEIS wiki] at [//oeis.org/ OEIS.org] was created to simplify the collaboration of the OEIS editors and contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oeisf.org/announcementNov2010.txt | title = New version of OEIS | date = 2010-11-17 | author = Neil Sloane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 200,000th sequence, {{OEIS link|A200000}}, was added to the database in November 2011; it was initially entered as A200715, and moved to A200000 after a week of discussion on the SeqFan mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.seqfan.eu/pipermail/seqfan/2011-November/015853.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[seqfan]&lt;/nowiki&gt; A200000|author=Neil J.

== Non-integers ==
Besides integer sequences, the OEIS also catalogs sequences of [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s, the digits of [[transcendental number]]s, [[complex number]]s and so on by transforming them into integer sequences.
Sequences of rationals are represented by two sequences (named with the keyword 'frac'): the sequence of numerators and the sequence of denominators. For example, the fifth order [[Farey sequence]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {1 \over 5}, {1 \over 4}, {1 \over 3}, {2 \over 5}, {1 \over 2}, {3 \over 5}, {2 \over 3}, {3 \over 4}, {4 \over 5}&lt;/math&gt;, is catalogued as the numerator sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 ({{OEIS link|A006842}}) and the denominator sequence 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5 ({{OEIS link|A006843}}).
Important irrational numbers such as π = 3.1415926535897... are catalogued under representative integer sequences such as [[decimal]] expansions (here 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8, 8, ... ({{OEIS link|A000796}})), [[binary number|binary]] expansions (here 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ({{OEIS link|A004601}})), or [[continued fraction]] expansions (here 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, ... ({{OEIS link|A001203}})).

== Conventions ==
The OEIS was limited to plain [[ASCII]] text until 2011, and it still uses a linear form of conventional mathematical notation (such as ''f''(''n'') for functions, ''n'' for running variables, etc.). [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] are usually represented by their full names, ''e.g.'', mu for μ, phi for φ.
Every sequence is identified by the letter A followed by six digits, almost always referred to with leading zeros, ''e.g.'', A000315 rather than A315.
Individual terms of sequences are separated by commas. Digit groups are not separated by commas, periods, or spaces.
In comments, formulas, etc., &lt;tt&gt;a(n)&lt;/tt&gt; represents the ''n''th term of the sequence.

=== Special meaning of zero ===
Zero is often used to represent non-existent sequence elements. For example, {{OEIS link|A104157}} enumerates the "smallest prime of ''n''² consecutive primes to form an ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] of least magic constant, or 0 if no such magic square exists." The value of ''a''(1) (a 1×1 magic square) is 2; ''a''(3) is 1480028129. But there is no such 2×2 magic square, so ''a''(2) is 0.
This special usage has a solid mathematical basis in certain counting functions. For example, the [[totient]] valence function ''N''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'') ({{OEIS link|A014197}}) counts the solutions of φ(''x'') = ''m''. There are 4 solutions for 4, but no solutions for 14, hence ''a''(14) of A014197 is 0—there are no solutions.
Occasionally −1 is used for this purpose instead, as in {{OEIS link|A094076}}.

=== Lexicographical ordering ===
The OEIS maintains the [[lexicographical order]] of the sequences, so each sequence has a predecessor and a successor (its "context").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome: Arrangement of the Sequences in Database|url=https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Arrangement_of_the_Sequences_in_Database|website=OEIS Wiki|accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; OEIS normalizes the sequences for lexicographical ordering, (usually) ignoring all initial zeros and ones, and also the sign of each element. Sequences of [[weight distribution]] codes often omit periodically recurring zeros.&lt;!-- Unclear, please rephrase. --&gt;

For example, consider: the [[prime number]]s, the [[palindromic prime]]s, the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], and the coefficients in the series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {{\zeta(n + 2)} \over {\zeta(n)}}&lt;/math&gt;. In OEIS lexicographic order, they are:
* Sequence #1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}
* Sequence #2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, ... {{OEIS link|id=A002385}}
* Sequence #3: {{bgcolor|lightpink|0, 1, 1,}} 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000045}}
* Sequence #4: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 56, 67, 79, 92, 106, 121, 137, 154, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000124}}
* Sequence #5: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}24, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}48, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, 72, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}120, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}168, 144, ... {{OEIS link|id=A046970}}
whereas unnormalized lexicographic ordering would order these sequences thus: #3, #5, #4, #1, #2.

==Self-referential sequences==&lt;!-- This section is linked from A053873 --&gt;
Very early in the history of the OEIS, sequences defined in terms of the numbering of sequences in the OEIS itself were proposed. "I resisted adding these sequences for a long time, partly out of a desire to maintain the dignity of the database, and partly because A22 was only known to 11 terms!", Sloane reminisced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = N. J. A. | last = Sloane | url = http://public.research.att.com/~njas/doc/sg.pdf | title = My favorite integer sequences | page = 10 | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the earliest self-referential sequences Sloane accepted into the OEIS was {{OEIS link|A031135}} (later {{OEIS link|A091967}}) "''a''(''n'') = ''n''-th term of sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or -1 if A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has fewer than n terms". This sequence spurred progress on finding more terms of {{OEIS link|A000022}}. 
{{OEIS link|A100544}} lists the first term given in sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it needs to be updated from time to time because of changing opinions on offsets. Listing instead term ''a''(1) of sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; might seem a good alternative if it weren't for the fact that some sequences have offsets of 2 and greater.
This line of thought leads to the question "Does sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contain the number ''n'' ?" and the sequences {{OEIS link|A053873}}, "Numbers ''n'' such that OEIS sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contains ''n''", and {{OEIS link|A053169}}, "''n'' is in this sequence if and only if ''n'' is not in sequence A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;". Thus, the composite number 2808 is in A053873 because {{OEIS link|A002808}} is the sequence of composite numbers, while the non-prime 40 is in A053169 because it's not in {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}, the prime numbers. Each ''n'' is a member of exactly one of these two sequences, and in principle it can be determined ''which'' sequence each ''n'' belongs to, with two exceptions (related to the two sequences themselves):
*It cannot be determined whether 53873 is a member of A053873 or not. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should not be. Nevertheless, either decision would be consistent, and would also resolve the question of whether 53873 is in A053169.
*It can be proved that 53169 [[principle of contradiction|both is and is not]] a member of A053169. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should not be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should be. This is a form of [[Russell's paradox]]. Hence it is also not possible to answer if 53169 is in A053873.

: Every sequence in the OEIS has a [[serial number]], a six-digit positive integer, prefixed by A (and zero-padded on the left prior to November 2004). The letter "A" stands for "absolute". Numbers are either assigned by the editor(s) or by an A number dispenser, which is handy for when contributors wish to send in related sequences at once and be able to create cross-references. An A number from the dispenser expires a month from issue if not used. But as the following table of arbitrarily selected sequences show, the rough correspondence holds.

: Even for sequences in the book predecessors to the OEIS, the ID numbers are not the same. The 1973 ''Handbook of Integer Sequences'' contained about 2400 sequences, which were numbered by lexicographic order (the letter N plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary), and the 1995 ''Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences'' contained 5487 sequences, also numbered by lexicographic order (the letter M plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary). These old M and N numbers, as applicable, are contained in the ID number field in parentheses after the modern A number.
; Sequence data
: The sequence field lists the numbers themselves, or at least about four lines' worth. The sequence field makes no distinction between sequences that are finite but still too long to display and sequences that are infinite. To help make that determination, you need to look at the keywords field for "fini", "full", or "more". To determine to which ''n'' the values given correspond, see the offset field, which gives the ''n'' for the first term given.
; Name
: The name field usually contains the most common name for the sequence, and sometimes also the formula. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, ({{OEIS link|A000578}}) is named "The cubes: a(n) = n^3.".
; Comments
: The comments field is for information about the sequence that doesn't quite fit in any of the other fields. The comments field often points out interesting relationships between different sequences and less obvious applications for a sequence. For example, Lekraj Beedassy in a comment to A000578 notes that the cube numbers also count the "total number of triangles resulting from criss-crossing [[Ceva's theorem|cevians]] within a triangle so that two of its sides are each n-partitioned," while Neil Sloane points out the unexpected relationship between centered hexagonal numbers ({{OEIS link|A003215}}) and second Bessel polynomials ({{OEIS link|A001498}}) in a comment to A003215.

: References to printed documents (books, papers, ...).
; Links
: Links, i.e. [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]], to online resources. These may be:
:# references to applicable articles in journals
:# links to the index

: Some examples of sequence member values.
; Maple
: [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] code.
; Mathematica
: [[Wolfram Language]] code.
; Program
: Originally [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] and [[Mathematica]] were the preferred programs for calculating sequences in the OEIS, and they both have their own field labels. {{As of|2016}}, Mathematica was the most popular choice with 100,000 Mathematica programs followed by 50,000 [[PARI/GP]] programs, 35,000 Maple programs, and 45,000 in other languages.
: As for any other part of the record, if there is no name given, the contribution (here: program) was written by the original submitter of the sequence.
; See also
: Sequence cross-references originated by the original submitter are usually denoted by "Cf."
: Except for new sequences, the see also field also includes information on the lexicographic order of the sequence (its "context") and provides links to sequences with close A numbers (A046967, A046968, A046969, A046971, A046972, A046973, in our example). The following table shows the context of our example sequence, A046970:

; Keyword
: The OEIS has its own standard set of mostly four-letter keywords that characterize each sequence:&lt;ref name="terms-explanation"&gt;{{cite web | url = //oeis.org/classic/eishelp2.html | work = On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences | title = Explanation of Terms Used in Reply From}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''base''' The results of the calculation depend on a specific positional base. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181 ... {{OEIS link|A002385}} are prime numbers regardless of base, but they are [[palindromic prime|palindromic]] specifically in base 10. Most of them are not palindromic in binary. Some sequences rate this keyword depending on how they're defined. For example, the [[Mersenne prime]]s 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, ... {{OEIS link|A000668}} does not rate "base" if defined as "primes of the form 2^n - 1". However, defined as "[[repunit]] primes in binary," the sequence would rate the keyword "base".
:* '''bref''' "sequence is too short to do any analysis with", for example, {{OEIS link|A079243}}, Number of isomorphism classes of associative non-commutative non-anti-associative anti-commutative closed binary operations on a set of order n.
:* '''cofr''' The sequence represents a [[continued fraction]], for example, continued fraction expansion of ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A003417}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A001203}}).
:* '''cons''' The sequence is a decimal expansion of a mathematical constant, like ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A001113}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A000796}}).
:* '''core''' A sequence that is of foundational importance to a branch of mathematics, such as the prime numbers ({{OEIS link|A000040}}), the Fibonacci sequence ({{OEIS link|A000045}}), etc.
:* '''dead''' This keyword used for erroneous sequences that have appeared in papers or books, or for duplicates of existing sequences. For example, {{OEIS link|A088552}} is the same as {{OEIS link|A000668}}.
:* '''dumb''' One of the more subjective keywords, for "unimportant sequences," which may or may not directly relate to mathematics. {{OEIS link|A001355}}, "Mix digits of pi and e." is one example of the former, and {{OEIS link|A082390}}, "Numbers on a computer numpad, read in a spiral." is an example of the latter.
:* '''easy''' The terms of the sequence can be easily calculated. Perhaps the sequence most deserving of this keyword is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... {{OEIS link|A000027}}, where each term is 1 more than the previous term. The keyword "easy" is sometimes given to sequences "primes of the form f(m)" where f(m) is an easily calculated function. (Though even if f(m) is easy to calculate for large m, it might be very difficult to determine if f(m) is prime).
:* '''eigen''' A sequence of [[eigenvalue]]s.
:* '''fini''' The sequence is finite, although it might still contain more terms than can be displayed. For example, the sequence field of {{OEIS link|A105417}} shows only about a quarter of all the terms, but a comment notes that the last term is 3888.
:* '''frac''' A sequence of either numerators or denominators of a sequence of fractions representing rational numbers. Any sequence with this keyword ought to be cross-referenced to its matching sequence of numerators or denominators, though this may be dispensed with for sequences of [[Egyptian fraction]]s, such as {{OEIS link|A069257}}, where the sequence of numerators would be {{OEIS link|A000012}}. This keyword should not be used for sequences of continued fractions, cofr should be used instead for that purpose.
:* '''full''' The sequence field displays the complete sequence. If a sequence has the keyword "full", it should also have the keyword "fini". One example of a finite sequence given in full is that of the [[Supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular prime]]s {{OEIS link|A002267}}, of which there are precisely fifteen.
:* '''hard''' The terms of the sequence cannot be easily calculated, even with raw number crunching power. This keyword is most often used for sequences corresponding to unsolved problems, such as "How many [[n-sphere|''n''-spheres]] can touch another ''n''-sphere of the same size?" {{OEIS link|A001116}} lists the first ten known solutions.
:* '''hear''' A sequence with a graph audio deemed to be "particularly interesting and/or beautiful".
:* '''less''' A "less interesting sequence".
:* '''look''' A sequence with a graph visual deemed to be "particularly interesting and/or beautiful".
:* '''more''' More terms of the sequence are wanted. Readers can submit an extension.
:* '''mult''' The sequence corresponds to a [[multiplicative function]]. Term a(1) should be 1, and term a(mn) can be calculated by multiplying a(m) by a(n) if m and n are coprime. For example, in {{OEIS link|A046970}}, a(12) = a(3)a(4) = -8 × -3.
:* '''new''' For sequences that were added in the last couple of weeks, or had a major extension recently. This keyword is not given a checkbox in the Web form for submitting new sequences, Sloane's program adds it by default where applicable.
:* '''nice''' Perhaps the most subjective keyword of all, for "exceptionally nice sequences."
:* '''nonn''' The sequence consists of nonnegative integers (it may include zeroes). No distinction is made between sequences that consist of nonnegative numbers only because of the chosen offset (e.g., ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the cubes, which are all positive from ''n'' = 0 forwards) and those that by definition are completely nonnegative (e.g., ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the squares).
:* '''obsc''' The sequence is considered obscure and needs a better definition.
:* '''sign''' Some (or all) of the values of the sequence are negative. The entry includes both a Signed field with the signs and a Sequence field consisting of all the values passed through the [[absolute value]] function.
:* '''tabf''' "An irregular (or funny-shaped) array of numbers made into a sequence by reading it row by row." For example, {{OEIS link|A071031}}, "Triangle read by rows giving successive states of cellular automaton generated by "rule 62."
:* '''tabl''' A sequence obtained by reading a geometric arrangement of numbers, such as a triangle or square, row by row. The quintessential example is [[Pascal's triangle]] read by rows, {{OEIS link|A007318}}.
:* '''uned''' The sequence has not been edited but it could be worth including in the OEIS. The sequence may contain computational or typographical errors. Contributors are encouraged to edit these sequences.
:* '''unkn''' "Little is known" about the sequence, not even the formula that produces it. For example, {{OEIS link|A072036}}, which was presented to the [[Internet Oracle]] to ponder.
:* '''walk''' "Counts walks (or self-avoiding paths)."
:* '''word''' Depends on the words of a specific language. For example, zero, one, two, three, four, five, etc. For example, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 8 ... {{OEIS link|A005589}}, "Number of letters in the English name of n, excluding spaces and hyphens."
: Some keywords are mutually exclusive, namely: core and dumb, easy and hard, full and more, less and nice, and nonn and sign.
; Offset
: The offset is the index of the first term given. For some sequences, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence {{OEIS link|A073502}}, the [[magic constant]] for ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, is an example of a sequence with offset 3, and {{OEIS link|A072171}}, "Number of stars of visual magnitude ''n''." is an example of a sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with ''n'' cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... {{OEIS link|A000124}}, with offset 0, while [[Mathworld]] gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely ''n'' = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents the index of the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus {{OEIS link|A000001}}, which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has '''1, 4''' as the internal value of the offset field.
; Author(s)
: The author(s) of the sequence is (are) the person(s) who submitted the sequence, even if the sequence has been known since ancient times. The name of the submitter(s) is given first name (spelled out in full), middle initial(s) (if applicable) and last name; this in contrast to the way names are written in the reference fields. The e-mail address of the submitter is also given, with the @ character replaced by "(AT)" with some exceptions such as for associate editors or if an e-mail address does not exist. For most sequences after A055000, the author field also includes the date the submitter sent in the sequence.
; Extension
: Names of people who extended (added more terms to) the sequence, followed by date of extension.

===Sloane's gap===
[[File:Sloanes gap.png|thumb|Plot of Sloane's Gap : number of occurrences (Y log scale) of each integer (X scale) in the OEIS database]]In 2009, the OEIS database was used by an amateur mathematician to measure the "importance" of each integer number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=Chasse aux nombres acratopèges|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2008/08/24/nombres-acratopeges|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result shown in the plot on the right shows a clear "gap" between two distinct point clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=La minéralisation des nombres|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2009/04/18/nombres-mineralises|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "uninteresting numbers" (blue dots) and the "interesting" numbers that occur comparatively more often in sequences from the OEIS. It contains essentially prime numbers (red), numbers of the form a^n (green) and [[highly composite number]]s (yellow). This phenomenon was studied by Nicolas Gauvrit, [[Jean-Paul Delahaye]] and Hector Zenil who explained the speed of the 2 clouds in terms of algorithmic complexity and the gap by social factors based on an artificial preference for sequences of primes, even numbers, geometric and Fibonacci-type sequences and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Gauvrit|first1=Nicolas|last2=Delahaye|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Zenil|first3=Hector|title=Sloane’s Gap.

In his 1557 work ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'', [[British people|British]] [[mathematician]] [[Robert Recorde]] proposed an exponent notation by [[prime factorisation]], which remained in use up until the eighteenth century and acquired the name ''Arabic exponent notation''.  The principle of Arabic exponents was quite similar to [[Egyptian fractions]]; large exponents were broken down into smaller prime numbers.  Squares and cubes were so called; prime numbers from five onwards were called ''sursolids''.

Although the terms used for defining exponents differed between authors and times, the general system was the primary exponent notation until [[René Descartes]] devised the Cartesian exponent notation, which is still used today.

This is a list of Recorde's terms.

The 1928 first edition thereof is considered the first elementary text clearly grounded in the formalism now known as [[first-order logic]] (FOL). Hilbert and Ackermann also formalized FOL in a way that subsequently achieved canonical status. FOL is now a core formalism of mathematical logic, and is presupposed by contemporary treatments of [[Peano arithmetic]] and nearly all treatments of [[axiomatic set theory]].

The 1928 edition included a clear statement of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] ([[decision problem]]) for FOL, and also asked whether that logic was [[Gödel's completeness theorem|complete]] (i.e., whether all semantic truths of FOL were theorems derivable from the FOL axioms and rules). The former problem was answered in the negative first by [[Alonzo Church]] and independently by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936.  The latter was answered affirmatively by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1929.

The text also touched on [[set theory]] and [[relational algebra]] as ways of going beyond FOL. Contemporary notation for logic owes more to this text than it does to the notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', long popular in the English speaking world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">A '''procept''' is an amalgam of three components: a '''process''' which produces a mathematical '''object''' and a '''symbol''' which is used to represent either process or object. It derives from the work of Eddie Gray and [[David O. Tall]], and is a much used construct in [[mathematics education]] research.

The notion was first published in a paper in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051025030243/http://my.nctm.org/eresources/journal_home.asp?journal_id=1 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education] in 1994, and is part of the process-object literature. This body of literature suggests that mathematical objects are formed by encapsulating processes, that is to say that the mathematical object 3 is formed by an encapsulation of the process of counting: 1,2,3...

Gray &amp; Tall's notion of procept improved upon the existing literature by noting that [[mathematical notation]] is often ambiguous as to whether it refers to process or object. Examples of such notations are:

:&lt;math&gt;3+4&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of adding as well as the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of summing an infinite sequence, and to the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x+2&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of mapping x to 3x+2 as well as the outcome of that process, the function f(x).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13897">The '''table of chords''', created by the astronomer, geometer, and geographer [[Ptolemy]] in [[Egypt]] during the 2nd century AD, is a [[trigonometric table]] in Book&amp;nbsp;I, chapter&amp;nbsp;11 of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'',&lt;ref name=toomer&gt;{{Citation|title=Ptolemy's Almagest|last1=Toomer|first1=G. J.|authorlink=Gerald J. Toomer|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year= 1998|ISBN =0-691-00260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise on [[mathematical astronomy]].  It is essentially equivalent to a table of values of the [[sine]] function.  It was the earliest trigonometric table extensive enough for many practical purposes, including those of astronomy (an earlier table of chords by [[Hipparchus]] gave chords only for arcs that were multiples of {{nowrap|{{sfrac|7|1|2}}° {{=}} {{sfrac|{{pi}}|24}} radians}}).&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNpHjqxQQ9oC&amp;pg=PA235 pp. 235&amp;ndash;236].&lt;/ref&gt;  Centuries passed before more extensive trigonometric tables were created. One such table is the ''[[Canon Sinuum (Bürgi)|Canon Sinuum]]'' created at the end of the 16th century.

== The chord function and the table ==

[[File:Chords.svg|thumb|right|350px|Example: The length of the chord subtending a {{sfrac|109|1|2}} arc is approximately&amp;nbsp;98.]]

A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of a [[circle]] is a line segment whose endpoints are on the circle.  Ptolemy used a circle whose diameter is&amp;nbsp;120.  He tabulated the length of a chord whose endpoints are separated by an arc of ''n''&amp;nbsp;degrees, for ''n'' ranging from {{sfrac|1|2}} to 180 by increments of&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}.  In modern notation, the length of the chord corresponding to an arc of ''θ''&amp;nbsp;degrees is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{chord} \theta = 120 \, \sin\left(\frac{\theta^\circ} 2 \right) \\
= {} &amp; 60 \cdot \left( 2 \, \sin\left(\frac{\pi\theta}{360} \text{ radians} \right) \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As ''θ'' goes from 0 to 180, the chord of a ''θ''° arc goes from 0 to&amp;nbsp;120.  For tiny arcs, the chord is to the arc angle in degrees as {{pi}} is to&amp;nbsp;3, or more precisely, the ratio can be made as close as desired to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;{{val|1.04719755}} by making ''θ'' small enough.  Thus, for the arc of {{sfrac|1|2}}°, the chord length is slightly more than the arc angle in degrees.  As the arc increases, the ratio of the chord to the arc decreases.  When the arc reaches 60°, the chord length is exactly equal to the number of degrees in the arc, i.e. chord&amp;nbsp;60°&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;60.  For arcs of more than 60°, the chord is less than the arc, until an arc of 180° is reached, when the chord is only&amp;nbsp;120.

The fractional parts of chord lengths were expressed in [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) numerals.  For example, where the length of a chord subtended by a 112° arc is reported to be 99&amp;nbsp;29&amp;nbsp;5, it has a length of

: &lt;math&gt; 99 + \frac{29}{60} + \frac{5}{60^2} = 99.4847\overline{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

rounded to the nearest&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=toomer /&gt;

After the columns for the arc and the chord, a third column is labeled "sixtieths".  For an arc of&amp;nbsp;''θ''°, the entry in the "sixtieths" column is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{chord} \left(\theta + \tfrac12 \right)^\circ - \operatorname{chord} \left( \theta^\circ\right)}{30}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the average number of sixtieths of a unit that must be added to chord(''θ''°) each time the angle increases by one minute of arc, between the entry for&amp;nbsp;''θ''° and that for&amp;nbsp;(''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}})°. Thus, it is used for [[linear interpolation]].  Glowatzki and Göttsche showed that Ptolemy must have calculated chords to five sexigesimal places in order to achieve the degree of accuracy found in the "sixtieths" column.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Glowatzki and Helmut Göttsche, ''Die Sehnentafel des Klaudios Ptolemaios.  Nach den historischen Formelplänen neuberechnet.'', München, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How Ptolemy computed chords ==

Chapter 10 of Book&amp;nbsp;I of the ''Almagest'' presents [[Euclidean geometry|geometric]] theorems used for computing chords.  Ptolemy used geometric reasoning based on Proposition&amp;nbsp;10 of Book&amp;nbsp;XIII of [[Euclid|Euclid's]] ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' to find the chords of 72° and&amp;nbsp;36°.  That Proposition states that if an equilateral [[pentagon]] is inscribed in a circle, then the area of the square on the side of the pentagon equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides of the [[hexagon]] and the [[decagon]] inscribed in the same circle.

He used [[Ptolemy's theorem]] on quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle to derive formulas for the chord of a half-arc, the chord of the sum of two arcs, and the chord of a difference of two arcs.  The theorem states that for a [[quadrilateral]] inscribed in a [[circle]], the product of the lengths of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of the two pairs of lengths of opposite sides.  The derivations of trigonometric identities rely on a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] in which one side is a diameter of the circle.

To find the chords of arcs of 1° and {{sfrac|1|2}}° he used approximations based on [[Aristarchus's inequality]].  The inequality states that for arcs ''α'' and ''β'', if 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;90°, then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sin \alpha}{\sin \beta} &lt; \frac\alpha\beta &lt; \frac{\tan\alpha}{\tan\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Ptolemy showed that for arcs of 1° and {{sfrac|1|2}}°, the approximations correctly give the first two sexigesimal places after the integer part.

== The numeral system and the appearance of the untranslated table ==

{{main|Greek numerals}}

Lengths of arcs of the circle, in degrees, and the integer parts of chord lengths, were expressed in a [[base 10]] [[numeral system]] that used 21 of the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]] with the meanings given in the following table, and a symbol, "∠′&amp;thinsp;", that means {{sfrac|1|2}} and a raised circle "○" that fills a blank space (effectively representing zero). Two of the letters, labeled "archaic" in the table below, had not been in use in the Greek language for some centuries before the ''Almagest'' was written, but were still in use as numerals and [[Ancient Greek music|musical notes]].
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{|rlr|rlr|rlr|}
\hline
\alpha &amp; \mathrm{alpha} &amp;  1 &amp; \iota &amp; \mathrm{iota} &amp; 10 &amp; \rho &amp; \mathrm{rho} &amp; 100 \\  \beta &amp; \mathrm{beta} &amp; 2 &amp; \kappa &amp; \mathrm{kappa} &amp; 20 &amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\  \gamma &amp; \mathrm{gamma} &amp; 3 &amp; \lambda &amp; \mathrm{lambda} &amp; 30 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \delta &amp; \mathrm{delta} &amp; 4 &amp; \mu &amp; \mathrm{mu} &amp; 40 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \varepsilon &amp; \mathrm{epsilon} &amp; 5 &amp; \nu &amp; \mathrm{nu} &amp; 50 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \stigma &amp; \mathrm{stigma\ (archaic)} &amp; 6 &amp; \xi &amp; \mathrm{xi} &amp; 60 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \zeta &amp; \mathrm{zeta} &amp; 7 &amp; \omicron &amp; \mathrm{omicron} &amp; 70 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \eta &amp; \mathrm{eta} &amp; 8 &amp; \pi &amp; \mathrm{pi} &amp; 80 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \theta &amp; \mathrm{theta} &amp; 9 &amp; \koppa &amp; \mathrm{koppa\ (archaic)} &amp; 90 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\  \hline
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for example, an arc of {{sfrac|143|1|2}}° is expressed as ''ρμγ''∠′. (As the table only reaches 180°, the Greek numerals for 200 and above are not used.)

The fractional parts of chord lengths required great accuracy, and were given in two columns in the table: The first column gives an integer multiple of {{sfrac|1|60}}, in the range 0–59, the second an integer multiple of {{sfrac|1|60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3600}}, also in the range 0–59.

Thus in  Heiberg's [http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/HeibergAlmagestComplete.pdf edition of the ''Almagest'' with the table of chords on pages 48–63], the beginning of the table, corresponding to arcs from {{sfrac|1|2}}° to {{sfrac|7|1|2}}°, looks like this:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc} \pi\varepsilon\rho\iota\varphi\varepsilon\rho\varepsilon\iota\tilde\omega\nu &amp; \varepsilon\overset{\text{'}}\nu\theta\varepsilon\iota\tilde\omega\nu &amp; \overset{\text{`}}\varepsilon\xi\eta\kappa\omicron\sigma\tau\tilde\omega\nu \\
\begin{array}{|l|} \hline \quad \angle' \\ \alpha \\  \alpha\;\angle' \\  \hline\beta \\  \beta\;\angle' \\  \gamma \\  \hline\gamma\;\angle' \\  \delta \\  \delta\;\angle' \\  \hline\varepsilon \\  \varepsilon\;\angle' \\  \stigma \\  \hline\stigma\;\angle' \\  \zeta \\  \zeta\;\angle' \\  \hline \end{array} &amp; \begin{array}{|r|r|r|} \hline\circ &amp; \lambda\alpha &amp; \kappa\varepsilon \\  \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \nu \\  \alpha &amp; \lambda\delta &amp; \iota\varepsilon \\  \hline \beta &amp; \varepsilon &amp; \mu \\  \beta &amp; \lambda\zeta &amp; \delta \\  \gamma &amp; \eta &amp; \kappa\eta \\  \hline \gamma &amp; \lambda\theta &amp; \nu\beta \\  \delta &amp; \iota\alpha &amp; \iota\stigma \\  \delta &amp; \mu\beta &amp; \mu \\  \hline \varepsilon &amp; \iota\delta &amp; \delta \\  \varepsilon &amp; \mu\varepsilon &amp; \kappa\zeta \\  \stigma &amp; \iota\stigma &amp; \mu\theta \\  \hline \stigma &amp; \mu\eta &amp; \iota\alpha \\  \zeta &amp; \iota\theta &amp; \lambda\gamma \\  \zeta &amp; \nu &amp; \nu\delta \\  \hline \end{array} &amp; \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|} \hline \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \nu \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \nu \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \nu \\  \hline \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \nu \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\eta \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\eta \\  \hline\circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\eta \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\zeta \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\zeta \\  \hline \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\stigma \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\varepsilon \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\delta \\  \hline \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\gamma \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\beta \\  \circ &amp; \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \mu\alpha \\  \hline \end{array}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Later in the table, one can see the base-10 nature of the numerals expressing the integer parts of the arc and the chord length.  Thus an arc of 85° is written as ''πε'' (''π'' for 80 and ''ε'' for 5) and not broken down into 60&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;25. The corresponding chord length is 81 plus a fractional part. The integer part begins with ''πα'', likewise not broken into 60&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;21. But the fractional part, {{sfrac|4|60}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|15|60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is written as ''δ'', for 4, in the {{sfrac|1|60}} column, followed by ''ιε'', for 15, in the {{sfrac|1|60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} column.
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc} \pi\varepsilon\rho\iota\varphi\varepsilon\rho\varepsilon\iota\tilde\omega\nu &amp; \varepsilon\overset{\text{'}}\nu\theta\varepsilon\iota\tilde\omega\nu &amp; \overset{\text{`}}\varepsilon\xi\eta\kappa\omicron\sigma\tau\tilde\omega\nu \\
\begin{array}{|l|} \hline \pi\delta\angle' \\  \pi\varepsilon \\  \pi\varepsilon\angle' \\  \hline  \pi\stigma \\  \pi\stigma\angle' \\  \pi\zeta \\  \hline \end{array} &amp; \begin{array}{|r|r|r|} \hline \pi &amp; \mu\alpha &amp; \gamma \\  \pi\alpha &amp; \delta &amp; \iota\varepsilon \\  \pi\alpha &amp; \kappa\zeta &amp; \kappa\beta \\  \hline \pi\alpha &amp; \nu &amp; \kappa\delta \\  \pi\beta &amp; \iota\gamma &amp; \iota\theta \\  \pi\beta &amp; \lambda\stigma &amp; \theta \\  \hline \end{array} &amp; \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|} \hline \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\stigma &amp; \kappa\varepsilon \\  \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\stigma &amp; \iota\delta \\  \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\stigma &amp; \gamma \\  \hline \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\varepsilon &amp; \nu\beta \\  \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\varepsilon &amp; \mu \\  \circ &amp; \circ &amp; \mu\varepsilon &amp; \kappa\theta \\  \hline \end{array}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
The table has 45&amp;nbsp;lines on each of eight pages, for a total of 360&amp;nbsp;lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9523">'''[[Quasi-empiricism]] in [[mathematics]]''' is the attempt in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] to direct philosophers' attention to [[mathematical practice]], in particular, relations with [[physics]], [[social science]]s, and [[computational mathematics]], rather than solely to issues in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. Of concern to this discussion are several topics: the relationship of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|empiricism]] (see [[Penelope Maddy|Maddy]]) with [[mathematics]], issues related to [[Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematical realism|realism]], the importance of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Social constructivism or social realism|culture]], necessity of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Constructivism|application]], [[et cetera|etc.]]

==Primary arguments==
A primary argument with respect to quasi-empiricism is that whilst mathematics and physics are frequently considered to be closely linked fields of study, this may reflect human [[cognitive bias]]. It is claimed that, despite rigorous application of appropriate [[empirical methods]] or [[mathematical practice]] in either field, this would nonetheless be insufficient to disprove alternate approaches.

[[Eugene Wigner]] (1960)&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Wigner]], 1960, "[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,]" ''Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics 13'':&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|noted]] that this culture need not be restricted to mathematics, physics, or even humans.  He stated further that "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning." Wigner used several examples to demonstrate why 'bafflement' is an appropriate description, such as showing how mathematics adds to situational knowledge in ways that are either not possible otherwise or are so outside normal thought to be of little notice. The predictive ability, in the sense of describing potential phenomena prior to observation of such, which can be supported by a mathematical system would be another example. 

Following up on [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]], [[Richard Hamming]] (1980)&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hamming|R. W. Hamming]], 1980, [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Hamming.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics], ''The [[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' Volume 87 Number 2 February 1980&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences#Hamming.27s follow-on to Wigner|applications of mathematics]] as a central theme to this topic and suggested that successful use can sometimes trump proof, in the following sense: where a theorem has evident veracity through applicability, later evidence that shows the theorem's proof to be problematic would result more in trying to firm up the theorem rather than in trying to redo the applications or to deny results obtained to date. [[Richard Hamming|Hamming]] had four explanations for the 'effectiveness' that we see with mathematics and definitely saw this topic as worthy of discussion and study. 

# "We see what we look for." Why 'quasi' is apropos in reference to this discussion.
# "We select the kind of mathematics to use." Our use and modification of mathematics is essentially situational and goal driven.
# "Science in fact answers comparatively few problems." What still needs to be looked at is a larger set.
# "The evolution of man provided the model." There may be limits attributable to the human element. 

For [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1960),&lt;ref&gt;Willard Van Orman Quine (1960), ''[[Word and Object]]'', MIT Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; existence is only existence in a structure. This position is relevant to quasi-empiricism, because Quine believes that the same evidence that supports theorizing about the structure of the world is the same as the evidence supporting theorizing about mathematical structures.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ernest (ed.), ''Mathematics Education and Philosophy: An International Perspective'', Routledge, 2003, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] (1975)&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1975, ''Mind, Language, and Reality.  Philosophical Papers, Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.  {{ISBN|88-459-0257-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that mathematics had accepted informal proofs and proof by authority, and had made and corrected errors all through its history. Also, he stated that [[Euclid]]'s system of proving [[geometry]] theorems was unique to the [[Ancient Greece|classical Greeks]] and did not evolve similarly in other mathematical cultures in [[China]], [[India]], and [[Arabia]].  This and other evidence led many mathematicians to reject the label of [[Philosophy of mathematics|Platonists]], along with [[Plato's ontology]]{{snd}} which, along with the methods and epistemology of [[Aristotle]], had served as a [[foundation ontology]] for the Western world since its beginnings.  A truly international culture of mathematics would, Putnam and others (1983)&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Benacerraf|Benacerraf, Paul]], and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]] (eds.), 1983, ''Philosophy of Mathematics, Selected Readings'', 1st edition, Prentice–Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1964.  2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; argued, necessarily be at least 'quasi'-empirical (embracing 'the scientific method' for consensus if not experiment).

[[Imre Lakatos#Proofs and refutations|Imre Lakatos]] (1976),&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos, Imre]] 1976, ''Proofs and Refutations''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-29038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who did his original work on this topic for his dissertation (1961, [[Cambridge]]), argued for '[[Imre Lakatos#Research programmes|Research Programs]]' as a means to support a basis for mathematics and considered [[thought experiments]] as appropriate to mathematical discovery. Lakatos may have been the first to use 'quasi-empiricism' in the context of this subject.

===Operational aspects===
Several recent works pertain to this topic. [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]'s and [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s work, though their positions may be considered controversial, apply.  Chaitin (1997/2003)&lt;ref name="limits"&gt;[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin, Gregory J.]], 1997/2003, "''[http://cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/lm.html Limits of Mathematics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101134749/http://cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/lm.html |date=January 1, 2006 }}''", Springer-Verlag, New York, NY.  {{ISBN|1-85233-668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests an underlying randomness to mathematics and  Wolfram (''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', 2002)&lt;ref name="new"&gt;[[Stephen Wolfram|Wolfram, Stephen]], 2002, ''A New Kind of Science'' ([http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/notes-section-12.8 Undecidables]), Wolfram Media, Chicago, IL.  {{ISBN|1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that undecidability may have practical relevance, that is, be more than an abstraction.  

Another relevant addition would be the discussions concerning [[interactive computation]], especially those related to the meaning and use of [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s model ([[Church-Turing thesis]], [[Turing machines]], etc.). 

These works are heavily computational and raise another set of issues. To quote Chaitin (1997/2003):  "Now everything has gone topsy-turvy.  It's gone topsy-turvy, not because of any philosophical argument, not because of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s results or [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s results or my own incompleteness results. It's gone topsy-turvy for a very simple reason — the computer!".&lt;ref name="limits"/&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Not found in archive.org, then not sure if mdash, not really ndash is in the quote.--&gt;

The collection of "Undecidables" in Wolfram (''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', 2002)&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; is another example. 

[[Peter Wegner|Wegner's]] 2006 paper "Principles of Problem Solving"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/pw/home.html Peter Wegner], Dina Goldin, 2006, "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1139922.1139942 Principles of Problem Solving]".  ''Communications of the ACM'' 49 (2006), pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ''[[interactive computation]]'' can help mathematics form a more appropriate framework ([[empirical]]) than can be founded with [[rationalism]] alone. Related to this argument is that the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] (even recursively related ad infinitum) is too simple a construct to handle the reality of entities that resolve (via computation or some type of analog) n-dimensional (general sense of the word) systems.

The '''Seneca effect''', or '''Seneca cliff''' or '''Seneca collapse''', is a [[mathematical model]], proposed by [[Ugo Bardi]]. This model is aimed to describe a class of problems in nature in which the decline is faster than growth, under the condition of some constraints. This model is closely related to the work ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' issued by the [[Club of Rome]] in the Seventies&lt;ref&gt;[https://sustainable.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2763500/MSSI-ResearchPaper-4_Turner_2014.pdf Turner, Graham. Is Global Collapse Imminent?. University of Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; and its main application is to describe various kind of economics under the condition of shortage of [[fossil fuel]]s, e.g. in relation to the [[Hubbert curve]].

The reference to the Latin philosopher and writer [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] of the model's name lies in the verse: ''the raise is gradual, the ruin is precipitous'' (Lucius Anneus Seneca, ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'', 91–63).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="946">In [[mathematics]], a set of '''simultaneous equations''', also known as a '''system of equations''' or an '''equation system''', is a [[finite set]] of [[equation]]s for which common solutions are sought. An equation system is usually [[Equation#Types of equations|classified in the same manner as single equations]], namely as a:
* [[System of linear equations]],
* [[System of nonlinear equations]],

==''The Education of T.C. MITS''==
Dr. [[Lillian Rosanoff Lieber]] wrote this treatise on mathematical thinking in twenty chapters. The writing took a form that resembled free-verse poetry, though Lieber included an introduction stating that the form was meant only to facilitate rapid reading, rather than emulate free-verse. Lieber's husband, a fellow professor at [[Long Island University]], Hugh Gray Lieber, provided illustrations for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Lieber, ''The Education of T.C. MITS'' (Philadelphia:  Paul Dry Books Incorporated, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book was meant to emphasize that mathematics can be understood by anyone, which was further shown when a special "Overseas edition for the Armed Forces" was published in 1942, and approved by the [[Council on Books in Wartime]] to be sent to American troops fighting in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Mazur.

A '''unary function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that takes one [[Parameter (computer science)|argument]].  A [[unary operator]] belongs to a subset of unary functions, in that its [[range of a function|range]] coincides with its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]].

== Examples ==

The [[successor function]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{succ}&lt;/math&gt;, is a unary operator. Its domain and codomain are the [[Natural number|natural numbers]], its definition is as follows:

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{succ} : \quad &amp; \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\
   &amp; n \mapsto (n + 1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In many [[Programming language|programming languages]] such as [[C (programming language)|C]], executing this operation is denoted by [[Reverse Polish notation|postfixing]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrel{+{+}}&lt;/math&gt; to the operand, i.e. the use of &lt;math&gt;n\mathrel{+{+}} &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to executing the assignment &lt;math&gt; n:= \operatorname{succ}(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Many of the [[elementary function]]s are unary functions, in particular the [[trigonometric functions]], [[logarithm]] with a pre-specified base, [[exponentiation]] to a pre-specified power or of a pre-specified base, and [[hyperbolic function]]s are unary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">In mathematics, a '''uniqueness theorem''' is a [[theorem]] proving that certain conditions determine a unique solution. Examples of uniqueness theorems include:

* [[Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem]] of three-dimensional polyhedra
* [[Black hole uniqueness theorem]]
* [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]] is the main local [[existence theorem|existence]] and uniqueness theorem for [[analytic function|analytic]] [[partial differential equation]]s associated with [[Cauchy problem|Cauchy initial value problem]]s.
* [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem#Cauchy–Kowalevski–Kashiwara theorem|Cauchy–Kowalevski–Kashiwara theorem]] is a wide generalization of the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem for systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients.
* [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], the uniqueness of prime factorization.
* [[Holmgren's uniqueness theorem]] for linear partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients.
* [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], the uniqueness of solutions to first-order differential equations.
* [[Thompson uniqueness theorem]] in finite group theory
* [[Uniqueness theorem for Poisson's equation]]
* [[Electromagnetism uniqueness theorem]] for the solution of Maxwell's equation
* [[Uniqueness case]] in finite group theory
A theorem, also called a unicity theorem, stating the uniqueness of a mathematical object, which usually means that there is only one object fulfilling given properties, or that all objects of a given class are equivalent (i.e., they can be represented by the same model). This is often expressed by saying that the object is uniquely determined by a certain set of data. The word unique is sometimes replaced by essentially unique, whenever one wants to stress that the uniqueness is only referred to the underlying structure, whereas the form may vary in all ways that do not affect the mathematical content.

A uniqueness theorem / proof is, at least within mathematics of differential equations, often combined with an existence theorem / proof to a combined existence and uniqueness theorem.
