[[File:Statue of Liberty 7.jpg|thumb|German professor Sieglinde Lemke argues that the [[Statue of Liberty]] "signifies this proselytizing mission as the natural extension of the US' sense of itself as an exceptional nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winfried Fluck|author2=Donald E. Pease|author3=John Carlos Rowe|title=Re-framing the Transnational Turn in American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMEHiv4LnasC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2011|publisher=University Press of New England|page=207|isbn=9781611681901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''American exceptionalism''' is an ideology holding the [[United States]] as unique among nations in positive or negative connotations, with respect to its ideas of democracy and personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=What, exactly, is 'American exceptionalism'? | author=Tyrrell, Ian | date=October 21, 2016 | magazine=The Week | url=http://theweek.com/articles/654508/what-exactly-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the concept has no formal definition, there are some themes common to various conceptions of the idea. One is the history of the United States is different from other nations.&lt;ref name="amerExcep"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=812lbix0oH4C&amp;pg=PA18 ''American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.''] Seymour Martin Lipset. New York, N.Y.: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc. 1996. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, American [[exceptionalism]] stems from the [[American Revolution]], becoming what political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] called "the first new nation"&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''The first new nation'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the American ideology of "[[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]", based on [[liberty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[individualism]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], [[democracy]], and [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]]. This [[ideology]] itself is often referred to as "American exceptionalism."&lt;ref name=Lipset1997&gt;Lipset, ''American Exceptionalism'', pp. 1, 17–19, 165–74, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme is the idea that the U.S. has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the [[Gettysburg address]] (1863), Americans have a duty to ensure "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Another theme is the sense the United States' history and mission give it a superiority over other nations.

The theory of the [[exceptionalism]] of the U.S. has developed over time and can be traced to many sources. French political scientist and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was the first writer to describe the country as "exceptional" in 1831 and 1840.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville, Alexis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEQvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Democracy in America''] (1840), part 2, p. 36: "The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."&lt;/ref&gt; The actual phrase "American Exceptionalism" was originally coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] as a critique of a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] faction of American Communists who argued that the American political climate was unique, making it an 'exception' to certain elements of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] is often credited with having crystallized this ideology in recent decades.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Political scientist Eldon Eisenach argues in the twenty-first century American exceptionalism has come under attack from the postmodern left as a reactionary myth: "The absence of a shared purposes ratified in the larger sphere of liberal-progressive public policy....beginning with the assumption of American exceptionalism as a reactionary myth."&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Eisenach, "A Progressive Conundrum: Federal Constitution, National State, and Popular Sovereignty" in Stephen Skowronek et al., eds., ''The Progressives' Century: Political Reform, Constitutional Government, and the Modern American State'' (Yale UP. 2016) pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

The exact term "American exceptionalism" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', Fred Shapiro notes "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by [[The Times]] of London on August 20, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/27/american_exceptionalism_neither_joseph_stalin_nor_alexis_de_tocqueville.html Zimmer, Ben "Did Stalin Really Coin "American Exceptionalism"?", Slate.com] Retrieved 1st of February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Its common use dates from Communist usage in the late 1920s. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] chastised members of the [[Jay Lovestone]]-led faction of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] for its claim the U.S. was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions". Stalin may have been told of the usage "American exceptionalism" by Broder &amp; Zack in ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American Communists started using the English term "American exceptionalism" in factional fights. It then moved into general use among intellectuals.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Albert Fried, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&amp;pg=PA7 ''Communism in America: A History in Documents''] (1997), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald E. Pease|title=The New American Exceptionalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=10|isbn=978-0-8166-2782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted most American historians endorse exceptionalism. He suggests these historians reason as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Richard | year = 1989 | title = How Exceptional is the American Political Economy? | jstor = 2150989 | journal = Political Science Quarterly | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.2307/2150989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[postnationalism|postnationalist]] scholars have rejected American exceptionalism, arguing the U.S. did not break from European history, and accordingly, the U.S. has retained class-based and [[racial inequality in the United States|race-based differences]], as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Noble, ''Death of a Nation: American Culture and the end of exceptionalism'', pp. xxiii ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:
:Why has the myth of American exceptionalism, characterized by a belief in America's highly distinctive features or unusual trajectory based on the abundance of its natural resources, its revolutionary origins and its Protestant religious culture that anticipated God's blessing of the nation, held such tremendous staying power, from its influence in popular culture to its critical role in foreign policy?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Roberts and Lindsay DiCuirci, eds., ''American Exceptionalism''  (2013) vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology, thereby avoid entangling themselves in rhetorical debates. [[Bernard Bailyn]], a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase "American exceptionalism," he insists upon the "distinctive characteristics of British North American life." He has argued the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly American patterns of education (in the broadest sense of the word); and he believes in the unique character of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen and Stanley N. Katz. "Bernard Bailyn, Historian, and Teacher: An Appreciation." in James A. Henretta, Michael Kämmen, and Stanley N. Katz, eds. ''The Transformation of Early American History: Society, Authority, and Ideology'' (1991) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Although the concept of American exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution''. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in the 1920s.

Some claim the phrase "American exceptionalism" originated with the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] in an English translation of a condemnation made in 1929 by Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] criticizing Communist supporters of [[Jay Lovestone]] for the heretical belief the US was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions".&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=American+exceptionalism+stalin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=piVIT6arD8Xt0gGMsIXuDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20exceptionalism%20stalin&amp;f=false The New American Exceptionalism], [[Donald E. Pease]]  U of Minnesota Press, 2009 {{ISBN|0-8166-2783-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-2783-7}} Length 246 pages p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This origin has been challenged, however, because the expression "American exceptionalism" was already used by Brouder &amp; Zack in the ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. Also, Fred Shapiro, editor of ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', has noted "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image during the Civil War by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 20, 1861.

Early examples of the term's usage do include a declaration made at the 1930 American Communist convention proclaiming "the storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="atl1"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-joseph-stalin-invented-american-exceptionalism/254534/ How Joseph Stalin Invented American Exceptionalism], ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase fell to obscurity after the 1930s, and in the 1980s American newspapers popularized it to describe America's cultural and political uniqueness.&lt;ref name="atl1" /&gt; The phrase became an issue of contention between presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], with Republicans attacking Obama for not believing in the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iviea | first1 = Robert L. | last2 = Ginerb | first2 = Oscar | year = 2009 | title = American Exceptionalism in a Democratic Idiom: Transacting the Mythos of Change in the 2008 Presidential Campaign | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 359–75 | doi = 10.1080/10510970903109961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==

=== Alexis de Tocqueville and others, from 1835 ===
The first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by French writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835/1840 work, ''[[Democracy in America]]'':&lt;ref&gt;"Foreword: on American Exceptionalism; Symposium on Treaties, Enforcement, and U.S. Sovereignty", ''Stanford Law Review'', May 1, 2003, p. 1479&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants, his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward; his religion alone bids him turn, from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us cease, then, to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis de Tocqueville]], ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Vintage Books, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kammen says many foreign visitors commented on American exceptionalism including [[Karl Marx]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Hermann Eduard von Holst]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Hilaire Belloc]]; they did so in complimentary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kammen p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the [[McGuffey Readers]] sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the ''Readers'' "hailed American exceptionalism, [[manifest destiny]], and America as God's country... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quentin R. Skrabec|title=William McGuffey: Mentor to American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiBkkpCRRg4C&amp;pg=PA223|year=2009|publisher=Algora Publishing|page=223|isbn=978-0-87586-728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communist debate, 1927 ===
In June 1927 [[Jay Lovestone]], a leader of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party in America]] and soon to be named General Secretary, described America's economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism, and the country's "tremendous reserve power"; strength and power which he said prevented [[Communist revolution]].&lt;ref name=Fried1997&gt;Fried, Albert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&amp;pg=PA82 ''Communism in America: a history in documents'', pp. 7–8, 19, 82–92.] Columbia University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-231-10235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], disagreeing America was so resistant to revolution, called Lovestone's ideas "the heresy of American exceptionalism"&lt;ref name=Keywords&gt;Pease, Donald E. Editors: Bruce Burgett and Glenn Hendler. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vIR8U3XyQMC&amp;pg=PT116 "Exceptionalism", pp. 108–12], in "Keywords for American Cultural Studies''. NYU Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-8147-9948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the first time the specific term "American exceptionalism" was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-4sZu02tqIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58 |pages=58–59 |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian T. |last2=Gaonkar |first2=Dilip Parameshwar |title=Globalizing American Studies |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-226-18507-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Depression]]  appeared to underscore Stalin's argument American capitalism falls under the general laws of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCoy|first=Terrence|title=How Joseph Stalin Invented 'American Exceptionalism'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-joseph-stalin-invented-american-exceptionalism/254534/|work=The Atlantic, March 15, 2012|accessdate=13 September 2013|date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1930, during the [[National conventions of the Communist Party USA|national convention of the Communist Party USA]] in New York, it was declared "The storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism and the whole system of opportunistic theories and illusions that had been built upon American capitalist 'prosperity'".&lt;ref&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States. Vol. II, Vol. II. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1994, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniqueness===
In general, Americans have had consideration in national "uniqueness." Historian Dorothy Ross points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics. 
# Some Protestants believed American progress would facilitate the return of Jesus Christ and [[Millennialism|Christian Millennium]].&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some 19th century historians linked American liberty to the development of liberty in Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Other American writers looked to the "millennial newness" of America. [[Henry Nash Smith]] stressed the theme of "virgin land" in the [[American frontier]] that promised an escape from the decay that befell earlier republics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Nash Smith, "The Frontier Hypothesis and the Myth of the West." ''American Quarterly'' 2.1 (1950): 3–11. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710571 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st-century development ===
Recently, socialists and other writers tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U.S. within and outside its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm American Exceptionalism]. The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept has also been discussed in the context of the 21st century in a book co-authored by [[Dick Cheney|former American Vice President Dick Cheney]]: ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name="simonandschuster"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America|author=Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= 2015 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= November 3, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes in their historical context ==
Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.

=== Absence of feudalism ===
Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist [[Louis Hartz]]. In ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist  and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked any feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates and a hereditary nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine A. |last=Holland |title=Hartz and Minds: The Liberal Tradition after the Cold War |journal=Studies in American Political Development |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=227–33 |doi=10.1017/S0898588X05000155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "liberal consensus" school, typified by [[David M. Potter|David Potter]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Richard Hofstadter]] followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding [[private property]], [[individual right]]s, and [[representative government]]. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Cross |title=Comparative Exceptionalism: Rethinking the Hartz Thesis in the Settler Societies of Nineteenth-Century United States and Australia |journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies |year=1995 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–41 |jstor=41053761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puritan roots and Protestant promise===
Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to [[Puritan|American Puritan]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Gandziarowski, ''The Puritan Legacy to American Politics'' (2010) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Many Puritans with [[Arminian]] leanings embraced a middle ground between strict [[Predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist predestination]] and a less restricting theology of [[Divine Providence]]. They believed God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, [[John Winthrop]], metaphorically expressed this idea as a "[[City upon a Hill]]"—that the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model community for the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Justin B. Litke, "Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist," ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html |title=John Winthrop, A Modell of Christian Charity(1630)|editor=The Hanover Historical Texts Project |publisher=Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1838), 3rd series 7:31–48. |date=August 1996 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413143419/http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html| archivedate= April 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans' moralistic values {{clarify|date=June 2018}} remained part of the national identity of the United States for centuries, remaining influential to the present day.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In this vein, Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. Eric Luis Uhlmann of Northwestern University argues that Puritan values were taken up by all remaining Americans as time went by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/AME%20CHAPTER.POSTING.pdf |title=Chapter posting |website=www.socialjudgments.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its ''Protestant Promise'', especially [[Catholics]] and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPIVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=protestant+promise#v=onepage&amp;q=protestant+promise&amp;f=false|title=Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise|first=Kevin M.|last=Schultz|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199987542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Revolution and republicanism ===
The ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. Historian [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] has argued, "Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wood, "Introduction" in ''Idea of America: Reflections on the Birth of the United States'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Idea-America-Reflections-United-States/dp/1594202907#reader_B004IYIUFG online].&lt;/ref&gt; Wood notes that the term is "presently much-maligned," although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnSvZs1Q7_oC&amp;pg=PT240|year= 2009|publisher=Penguin|page=240|isbn=9781440637919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land, a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to [[republicanism]], the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ari |last=Hoogenboom |authorlink=Ari Hoogenboom |chapter=American Exceptionalism Republicanism as Ideology |editor-first=Elisabeth |editor-last=Gläser |editor2-first=Hermann |editor2-last=Wellenreuther |title=Bridging the Atlantic: the question of American exceptionalism in perspective |year=2002 |pages=43–67 |isbn=978-0-521-78205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom characterized the [[American Revolution]] in unique ways—at a time when major nations had state religions. Republicanism (led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]) created modern [[constitutional republicanism]], with a limit on ecclesiastical powers. Historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, "With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some particular purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kidd |title=God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2010 |page=9 |isbn=978-0-465-00235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd further argues that "a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, ''God of Liberty,'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty ===
According to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America "was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions". Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on "reason of state" (which could justify any action) and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, ''Empire of liberty: the statecraft of Thomas Jefferson'' (1992) quote on p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson envisaged America is becoming the world's great "[[Empire of Liberty]]"—that is, the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, for, he said on departing the presidency in 1809, America was: "Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tucker and  Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty'' p. 7; see John P. Foley, ed. ''The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia'' (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA895&amp;dq=%22Trusted+with+the+destinies+of+this+solitary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T4A-Ttm4IMPTiAK-37zDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Trusted%20with%20the%20destinies%20of%20this%20solitary%22&amp;f=false text p. 895]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of arguments ==

[[Marilyn B. Young]] argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an "American empire," a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of American empire. Young says the Iraq War (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn B. Young, "One Empire Under G", ''European Contributions to American Studies'', May 2004, Vol. 55, pp. 8–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, conservative historians [[Larry Schweikart]] and Dave Dougherty argued that American Exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) [[Common Law]]; (2) Virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) Free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, From America's Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb, 1898–1945''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-089-8}}. Moreover, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, Vol. II, From the Cold War to the Age of Entitlement, 1945–2012''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 book entitled ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', former U.S. [[Vice President Dick Cheney]] sets out and argues the case for American Exceptionalism, and concludes: "we are, as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] said, 'the last, best hope of earth.' We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Dick and Liz Cheney. ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', Threshold Editions, New York, 2015. pp. 259ff. {{ISBN|978-1-5011-1541-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States be exceptional in that it was founded on a set of [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his [[Gettysburg Address]], America is a nation "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". In Lincoln's interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and in world perspective, the American mission is to ensure, "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."  Historian [[T. Harry Williams]] argues that Lincoln believed:
: In the United States man would create a society that would be the best and the happiest in the world. The United States was the supreme demonstration of democracy. However, the Union did not exist just to make men free in America. It had an even greater mission—to make them free everywhere. By the mere force of its example, America would bring democracy to an undemocratic world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, "Abraham Lincoln – Principle and Pragmatism in Politics: A Review Article," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1953) 40#1 pp. 89–106 at page 97 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1897545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and [[checks and balances]] (among the legislative, executive and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a "[[tyranny of the majority]]", are preservative of a free republican democracy, and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters' values. A consequence of this political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than does a more [[unitary state|unitary]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Alan Dahl|title=Toward democracy--a journey: reflections, 1940–1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FacUAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies Press, University of California, Berkeley|page=2:711|isbn=9780877723721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Eric Foner]] has explored the question of birthright citizenship, the provision of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) that makes every baby born in the United States a full citizen.
He argues that:
: birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism... birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner,
[http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/ "Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism," ''The Nation'' Aug. 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global leadership and activism ===
Yale Law School Dean [[Harold Hongju Koh]] has identified what he says is "the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism." He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hongju Koh, "On American Exceptionalism" 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1479 (2003) quote at p. 1487 [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2737&amp;context=fss_papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peggy Noonan]], an American political pundit, wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that "America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional".

Former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on American foreign policy entitled ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', co-authored with his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]], a former official of the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= September 2015|website= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= October 5, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frontier spirit ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the "American spirit"  were shaped by the frontier process (following [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]). They argue the American frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Etulain, ''Does the Frontier Experience Make America Exceptional?'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations had frontiers, but it did not shape them nearly as much as the American frontier did, usually because it was under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia had long frontiers, but they did not have "free land" and local control.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D. Wyman and Clifton B. Kroeber, eds. ''Frontier in Perspective'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The political and cultural environments were much different—the other frontiers did not involve widespread ownership of free land nor allow the settlers to control the local and provincial governments as in America. Their edge did not shape their national psyches.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin K. Mikesell, "Comparative Studies in Frontier History," in Richard Hofstadter and Seymour Martin Lipset, eds., ''Turner and the Sociology of the Frontier'' (1968) pp. 152–72&lt;/ref&gt; Each nation had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers]] in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, "mateship" and working together was valued more than individualism was in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mateship and Individualism in Modern Australian Drama |first=Dennis |last=Carroll |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1982 |pages=467–80 |jstor=3206809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobility and welfare ===
{{further|Economic mobility|Social mobility}}
For most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, the United States has been known as the "land of opportunity", and in this sense, it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hartmut |last=Kaelble |title=Social Mobility in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Europe and America in Comparative Perspective |year=1981 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-05274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this [[social mobility]] include:
* Occupational—children could easily choose careers which were not based upon their parents' choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephan |last=Thernstrom |title=The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880–1970 |year=1999 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-1-58348-443-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical—that geographical location was not seen as static, and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Stephenson |first2=Richard |last2=Jensen |first3=Janice Reiff |last3=Webster |title=Social predictors of American mobility: a census capture-recapture study of New York and Wisconsin, 1875–1905 |publisher=Newberry Library |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Status—as in most countries, family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle. America was notably unusual due to an accepted wisdom that anyone—from poor immigrants upwards—who worked hard, could aspire to similar standing, regardless of circumstances of birth. This aspiration is commonly called living the [[American dream]]. Birth details were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or high political status in American culture. This stood in contrast to other countries where many larger offices were socially determined, and usually hard to enter without being born into the suitable social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter M. |last=Blau |first2=Otis Dudley |last2=Duncan |title=The American Occupational Structure |location=London |publisher=Collier Macmillan |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-02-903670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, social mobility in the U.S. is lower than in some [[European Union]] countries if defined regarding income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar people in the [[Nordic countries]] or the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/338|title=Structural rigidities in the US and Europe|last=De Grauwe|first=Paul|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many economists, such as Harvard economist [[N. Gregory Mankiw]], however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: "Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html|date=January 12, 2011|title=Half-Full Glass of Economic Mobility|format=blog|first=Greg|last=Mankiw|accessdate=January 1, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122182147/http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html| archivedate= January 22, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding public welfare, [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. "is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional." He concludes, "By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "How Exceptional is the American Political Economy?" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1989) 104#1 pp. 91, 92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150989 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Scholars have been polarized on the topic, according to [[Michael Kammen]] with historians generally against it, while empirical social scientists have tended to be supporters.   Kammen reports that historians Lawrence Veysey, [[C. Vann Woodward]], [[Eric Foner]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Akira Iriye]],  and Ian Tyrrell have been opponents, while support has come from social scientists [[Daniel Bell]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], Alex Inkeles, Sanford Jacoby, [[Samuel P. Huntington]], Mona Harrington, John P. Roche, Richard Rose, [[Peter Temin]], and [[Aaron Wildavsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" ''American Quarterly'' (1993) p. 2 [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR2/kammen.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kammen argues that the hostile attacks began in the 1970s in the wake of the Vietnam War, when many intellectuals decided, "The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the [[social history|new social history]] used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as social mobility. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a work party to emerge in the United States did not mean that America was exceptionally favorable grounds for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme chauvinism displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally mid-1980s, colonial historians downplayed the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history.&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some of the critics pulled their punches, with Wilentz arguing for "distinctively American forms of class conflict" and Foner saying there was a  "distinctive character of American trade unionism."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The third idea of American exceptionalism—superiority—has been attacked with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In ''American Exceptionalism and Human Rights'' (2005), Canadian commentator [[Michael Ignatieff]] couches his discussion of the topic in entirely pejorative terms. He identifies three main sub-types: "exemptionalism" (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); "double standards" (criticizing "others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies, but ignoring what these organizations say of the United States"); and "legal isolationism" (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Ignatieff|title=American Exceptionalism and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUiZLQdGJwkC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2009|pages=3–8|isbn=978-1400826889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exceptionalism as "exemptionalism" ===
During the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hegemony or Empire?: The Redefinition of US Power Under George W. Bush |author=Charles Philippe David, David Grondin|isbn = 978-0754647744|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being "above" or an "exception" to the law, specifically the [[public international law|Law of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/ |title=Could Bush Be Prosecuted for War Crimes? |journal=Alternet |last=Frel |first=Jan |date=July 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225220/http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/| archivedate= May 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.) This new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis, and actual orientation diverges somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to "old-style" or "traditional American exceptionalism"-the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others, that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history—also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by the [[public international law]]. Indeed, recent research shows that "there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thimm|first=Johannes|title=American Exceptionalism – Conceptual Thoughts and Empirical Evidence|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=29 October 2013|location=Berlin|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2013, in the context of U.S. President Barack Obama's comment about American exceptionalism during his September 10, 2013, talk to the American people while considering military action on [[Syria]] for its alleged use of [[chemical weapons]] against civilians, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized Obama saying that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?_r=0 ''Vladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fuss.''] CNN. 12 September 2013. Retrieved 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]] on October 4, 2013, President of Ecuador [[Rafael Correa]] criticized Obama's policies and compared America's exceptionalism with [[Nazi Germany]], saying: "Does not this remind you of the Nazis' rhetoric before and during World War II?

Critics on the left such as Marilyn Young and [[Howard Zinn]] have argued that American history is so morally flawed, citing [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] and [[social welfare]] issues, that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Zinn |title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present |year=1980 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=|title-link=A People's History of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign, especially when dealing with Native Americans.&lt;ref name="The Myth of American Exceptionalism"&gt;{{cite web | author = Howard Zinn |url=http://video.mit.edu/watch/the-myth-of-american-exceptionalism-9935/|title = The Myth of American Exceptionalism |accessdate=October 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192523/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/258/| archivedate= October 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald E. Pease]] mocks American exceptionalism as a "state fantasy" and a "myth" in his 2009 book ''The New American Exceptionalism''.&lt;ref name="Pease"&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Pease |title=The New American Exceptionalism |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pease notes that "state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask", showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] and the exposure of government incompetence after [[Hurricane Katrina]] "opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="Pease" /&gt;

American theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] argued that the automatic assumption that America acts for the right will bring about moral corruption. However, Niebuhr did support the nation's Cold War policies. His position (called "[[Christian realism]]") advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=Mark |last=Edwards |title='God Has Chosen Us': Re-Membering Christian Realism, Rescuing Christendom, and the Contest of Responsibilities during the Cold War |journal=Diplomatic History |year=2009 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67–94 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2008.00747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double standards ===
U.S. historians like Thomas Bender "try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the [[Cold War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/wp/?p=307 |title=Index of /wp |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary W.

=== The Americanist heresy ===
{{Main|Americanism (heresy)}}

In 1898 [[Pope Leo XIII]] denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanism]] in the encyclical ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7630&amp;CFID=11811177&amp;CFTOKEN=51286733 |title=Americanism, Then and Now: Our Pet Heresy |publisher=Catholic Culture |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He targeted  American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain, arguing that it stood in  opposition to Papal denunciations of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm |title=The Heresy of Americanism: Response to Radical Traditionalists |publisher=Bringyou.to |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100205103443/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm| archivedate= February 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.as.wvu.edu/massey.htm |title=The Phantom Heresy? |publisher=West Virginia University |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, there was a tendency among Catholic clergy in the United States to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations, and to argue that the understanding of Church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass  the 'American Experience', which included greater individualism, tolerance of other religions, and Church–State separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAvoy | first1 = Thomas T. | year = 1959 | title = The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899–1917 | url = | journal = Review of Politics | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 53–82 | doi=10.1017/s0034670500021975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-emptive declinism ===
[[Herbert London]] has defined ''pre-emptive [[declinism]]'' as a postmodern belief "that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=6372 |title=Is the U.S. Still a Dependable Ally? |publisher=Hudson Institute |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; London ascribed the view to [[Paul Krugman]], among others.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=35976 |title=Examining Declinism |publisher=HumanEvents.com |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman had written in ''The New York Times'' that "We have always known that America's reign as the world's greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when it came, would be something grand and tragic."&lt;ref name=Krugman /&gt;

According to [[RealClearPolitics]], declarations of America's declining power have been common in the English-language media. In 1988, [[Flora Lewis]] said that "Talk of U.S. decline is real in the sense that the U.S. can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills." According to [[Anthony Lewis]] in 1990, Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline. Citing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy and "crucial weaknesses" in the military, [[Tom Wicker]] concluded "that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult—nearly impossible—for the United States".&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com" /&gt; In 2004, [[Pat Buchanan]] lamented "the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism |title=The Decline and Fall of Declinism |publisher=American.com |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129075119/http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism| archivedate= January 29, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Matthew Parris]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in London wrote that the United States is "overstretched", romantically recalling the Kennedy presidency, when "America had the best arguments" and could use moral [[persuasion]] rather than force to have its way in the world. From his vantage point in Shanghai, the ''International Herald Tribune''{{'}}s [[Howard W. French|Howard French]] worries about "the declining moral influence of the United States" over an emergent China.&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/declinism.html |title=Three Centuries of American Declinism |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The Post-American World'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Fareed Zakaria]] refers to a "Post-American world" that he says "is not about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, Fareed, ''The Post-American World''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-670-08229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similarities between the U.S. and Europe ===
In December 2009, historian [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]] published a book arguing that, despite widespread attempts to contrast the '[[American way of life]]' and the '[[European social model]]', America and Europe are actually very similar to a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the U.S. and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ba6ffa-ed90-11de-ba12-00144feab49a,s01=1.html|title=Financial Times|last=Lloyd|first=John|date=December 20, 2009|work=Martian myths that flatter Europe|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]] argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which this subject has been broached the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the "dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance," and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which these characteristics are concentrated there.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto, Felipe. ''The Americas: A Hemispheric History''. New York: Modern Library, 2003. p. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current official stance and its detractors ==
In April 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] responded to a journalist's question in Strasbourg with the statement, "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kirchick28-2009apr28,0,4218519.story |title=Squanderer in chief |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2010 | first=James | last=Kirchick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama further noted that "I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040400700.html |title=On European Trip, President Tries to Set a New, Pragmatic Tone |work=The Washington Post |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2010 | first=Michael| last=Sheer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitt Romney]] attacked Obama's statement, arguing it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitt Romney|title=No Apology: The Case for American Greatness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDpBpo5CVB4C&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=29|isbn=978-1-4299-3960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Arkansas Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] said that Obama's "worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we've had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith, "The New Battle: What It Means to be American," August 20, 2010, [www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41273.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on the [[Syrian civil war|Syria crisis]] on September 10, 2013, Obama said: "however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Tumulty, "American exceptionalism, explained", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/12/american-exceptionalism-explained/?hpid=z10 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In a direct response the next day, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] published an [[op-ed]] in ''The New York Times'', articulating that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisher, "Vladimir Putin's New York Times op-ed, annotated and fact-checked", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/12/vladimir-putins-new-york-times-op-ed-annotated-and-fact-checked/?hpid=z1 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's views were soon endorsed by future president [[Donald Trump]] who declared the op-ed "a masterpiece": "You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You are not going to like that term," Trump said. "It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Kirchick|Kirchik, James]] (15 August 2016), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/15/beware-the-hillary-clinton-loathing-donald-trump-loving-useful-idiots-of-the-left.html?via=newsletter&amp;source=CSAMedition "Beware the Hillary Clinton-Loathing, Donald Trump-Loving Useful Idiots of the Left"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump's stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the [[New America Foundation]], who in a 2016 ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' magazine symposium remarked that "Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that [[Hillary Clinton]] and many Republicans support".&lt;ref&gt;Schwenninger, Sherle R., Heather Hurlburt, [[Stephen Kinzer]] and [[Juan Cole]] (24 May 2016),

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], official [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Renan's "&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/Marr-Wilhelm-Der-Sieg-des-Judenthums-ueber-das-Germanenthum-2-2 Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet]''. Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!) (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marr |first=Wilhem |author-link=Wilhelm Marr |url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Marr-Text-English.pdf |title=The Victory of Judaism over Germanism: Viewed from a Nonreligious Point of View |translator-first=Gerhard |translator-last=Rohringer |year=1879 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the "Anti-Chancellor League," which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended. Already in 1936 Bolkestein, for example, wrote an article on ''Het "antisemietisme" in de oudheid'' (Anti-Semitism in the ancient world) in which the word was placed between quotation marks and a preference was expressed for the term hatred of the Jews… Nowadays the term anti-Judaism is often preferred. It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Evolution of usage===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, "Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)" in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938. Cited in [[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction''. Harper Collins, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |first1=Donald L. |last1=Niewyk|first2=Francis R. |last2=Nicosia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-6vKBHggVwC&amp;pg=PA215|isbn=978-0-231-11201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |pages=30–31 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30|isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious antisemitism===
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), accused of a relapse into Judaism, [[Mexico City]], 1601]]
[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon.

Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin).

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria.

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed in numerous persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire Philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L.]] ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''.

===Louis de Bonald and the Catholic Counter-Revolution===
The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner].

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] essay ''[[On The Jewish Question]]'' as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883) |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |last=Jacobs |first=Jack |editor=Levy, Richard S. |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-439-4 |pages=446–447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999"&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

After [[Operation Barbarossa|the beginning]] of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic [[genocide]]: [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="saul1"&gt;[[Saul Friedländer]] (2008): ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews''.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues).

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "[[usury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape.

Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrucci|first=Filippo|last2=Fois|first2=Marisa|date=2016-03-03|title=Attitudes towards Israel in Tunisian political debate: from Bourguiba to the new constitution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=392–410|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]]. 

In modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Israeli|first=Raphael|title=Anti-Semitism under the Guise of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Israelism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315124933-6|work=Muslim Anti-Semitism in Christian Europe|pages=149–189|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315124933|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.

Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese first learned about antisemitism in 1918, during the cooperation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] with the [[White movement]] in [[Siberia]]. [[White Army#Structure|White Army]] soldiers had been issued copies of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', and "The ''Protocols'' continue to be used as evidence of Jewish conspiracies even though they are widely acknowledged to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yetAgAAQBAJ Esther Webman, ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth,'' Jewish Studies Series, Routledge, 2012.] {{ISBN|1136706100}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] encouraged Japan to adopt antisemitic policies. In the post-war period, [[Extremism|extremist groups]] and [[ideologues]] have promoted [[conspiracy theories]].

In 2004, [[Al-Manar]], a media network affiliated with [[Hezbollah]], aired a drama series, ''The Diaspora'', which observers allege is based on historical antisemitic allegations.

Although [[Malaysia]] presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called "antisemitism without Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Jonathan|title=Klezmer America : Jewishness, ethnicity, modernity|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14278-6|page=140|edition=1st}} Hyphenation added by Fulford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fulford|first1=Robert|title=Anti-Semitism without Jews in Malaysia|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/06/robert-fulford-anti-semitism-without-jews-in-malaysia|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country."

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation.

France is home to the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000).

Jewish philanthropist Baron [[Eric de Rothschild]] suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated.

In March 2012, Mohammed Merah [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|opened fire at a Jewish school]] in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that it was "obvious" it was an antisemitic attack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School Shooting Gun Same As Other Attacks|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16191704|newspaper=Sky News|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. [[Richard Prasquier]] from the French Jewish umbrella group, [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack Read more: Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of [[Noisy-le-Grand]] of the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] district in [[Paris]]. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."&lt;ref name=Algemeiner1&gt;{{cite news|title=French Synagogue Vandalized For Third Time in Ten Days|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/12/french-synagogue-vandalized-for-third-time-in-ten-days/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Algemeiner|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, [[Abraham Cooper]], the dean of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], met French Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Merah's shooting spree]] in [[Toulouse]].

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Nieuwe CIDI Monitor antisemitisme" (Dutch)|url=http://www.niw.nl/nieuwe-cidi-monitor-antisemitisme/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]] was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

Retrieved on 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an [[Orthodox judaism|orthodox]] rabbi in [[Amsterdam]], told the [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper [[Aftenposten]] that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece Hets av jøder er økende i Europa – Aftenposten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411225535/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece |date=11 April 2012 }}. Aftenposten.no. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"&gt;Henrik Bachner and Jonas Ring.{{cite web|url=http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |title=Antisemitic images and attitudes in Sweden |accessdate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221140257/http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df=dmy }} . levandehistoria.se&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims "harbour systematic antisemitic views".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"/&gt; The former prime minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic.

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted "Hitler" in the streets. As a result of security concerns, Malmö's synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, and the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.&lt;ref name="Malmo Jews leaving Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7278532/Jews-leave-Swedish-city-after-sharp-rise-in-anti-Semitic-hate-crimes.html | title=Jews leave Swedish city after sharp rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes | work=The Telegraph | date=21 February 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2012 | author=Meo, Nick | location=Malmo, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A. Small|Charles Small]] of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study antisemitism] Associated Press, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America]. Adl.org. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study published in ''[[Boston Review]]'' found that nearly 25% of non-Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the [[financial crisis of 2008–2009]], with a higher percentage among Democrats than Republicans. 32% of Democrats blamed Jews for the financial crisis, versus 18% for Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Malhotra and Yotam Margalit.

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico’s Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politico goes full ‘Elders of Zion,’ silenced by the college mob &amp; other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/11/27/we-cant-just-rely-old-tactics|title=We Can't Just Rely on the Old Tactics|website=ReformJudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2018, an antisemitic terrorist attacked the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Pittsburgh matters - Religion News Service |url=https://religionnews.com/2018/10/28/tree-of-life-pittsburgh/ |website=Religion News Service |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalist''' is a for-profit corporation based in Washington, D.C., that operates a [[voter database]].&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ambinder|first1=Marc|title=Exclusive: How Democrats Won The Data War In 2008|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/10/exclusive-how-democrats-won-the-data-war-in-2008/27647/|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
It was founded in 2006 by [[Harold M. Ickes]] with seed money from [[George Soros]]. It specializes in [[microtargeting]] for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Robert|title=Catalist, the left’s secret electoral weapon, outguns GOP|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/19/knight-the-lefts-mighty-catalist/?page=all|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Washington Times|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded as Data Warehouse, LLC.&lt;ref name="CatalistBloomberg"&gt;{{cite web

Catalist's CEO is [[Laura Quinn]], an economic policy advisor in the U.S. Senate and former Deputy Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore. 

In August 2016, Catalist analyzed records from 10 [[battleground states]] through June and found a major influx of new voters, majority-white, were responsible for the record-breaking turnout in the Republican primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/donald-trumps-great-white-hope-is-fading-fast.html|title=Donald Trump’s Great White Hope Is Fading Fast|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/voter-influx-appears-missing-for-trump-1471912460|title=Voter Influx Appears Missing for Trump|last=Tau|first=ron|date=2016-08-23|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaboration between Catalist and [[SurveyMonkey]] showed that Sanders supporters voted less frequently and were less reliably Democratic than Clinton supporters.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Catalist served as the principal repository of Democratic data, working with over 90 liberal groups including the [[Service Employees International Union]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], and the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

Catalist has engaged in [[data mining]] on behalf of clients such as [[Rock the Vote]] and [[EMILY's List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Issenberg|first1=Sasha|title=For Sale: Detailed Voter Profiles|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/victory_lab/2012/01/the_co_op_and_the_data_trust_the_dnc_and_rnc_get_into_the_data_mining_business_.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Slate|date=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalist receives funding from the [[Democracy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Confessore|first1=Nicholas|title=Groups Mobilize to Aid Democrats in ’14 Data Arms Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/us/politics/groups-mobilize-to-aid-democrats.html|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Catalist received $725,000 from the [[National Education Association]], a major teachers union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/08/15/if-your-childs-school-is-failing-thank-union.html|title=If your child's school is failing, thank a union {{!}} Fox News|last=Berman|first=Richard|date=2016-08-15|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3585">A '''civic lottery''', a popular term for the contemporary use of [[sortition]] or allotment, is a lottery-based method for selecting citizens for public service or office. It is based on the premise that citizens in a democracy have both a duty and the desire to serve their society by participating in its governance.

Today, the most common use of the civic lottery process is found in many Anglo-Saxon judicial systems where citizen juries are summoned to hear and render verdicts in court cases. The term for this is popularly known as [[jury duty]].

Civic lotteries are increasingly popular in Canada, where provincial Citizens' Assemblies on Electoral Reform took place in British Columbia in 2004 and in Ontario in 2006. The membership of each Assembly was determined by a civic lottery which invited citizens to volunteer as candidates.
In British Columbia, the government sent 23,034 letters to randomly identified citizens throughout the province. 1,715 replied and volunteered to serve as members of the Assembly. In Ontario, 123,489 citizens were identified during a random electronic draw from the Permanent Register of Electors. Each citizen received a letter inviting him or her to apply and 7,033 volunteered as candidates. Ultimately, during a final selection process 158 names were drawn from among the candidates to participate as members of the BC Assembly. 103 were selected as members in Ontario.

[[MASS LBP]], a Canadian company inspired by the work of the [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (Ontario)]] has developed an increasingly sophisticated system for running civic lotteries to randomly select citizens to participate on government advisory panels. The lotteries, which ask citizens to give up several consecutive weekends to participate on a panel, enjoy a strong positive response rate, typically exceeding five percent. This suggests that citizens are more interested public affairs than declining voter-turnout rates indicate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/426710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20090316/MACGREGOR16/Columnists/Columnist?author=Roy+MacGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

Panel members are randomly selected from among the pool of candidate-respondents to create a panel that roughly matches the demographic profile of the wider population.

The '''''Codex Alimentarius''''' is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations relating to [[food]]s, food production, and [[food safety]].

Its name is derived from the [[Codex Alimentarius Austriacus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7700t/v7700t09.htm ''Codex Alimentarius'': how it all began] Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website. Accessed 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its texts are developed and maintained by the '''''Codex Alimentarius'' Commission''', a body that was established in early November 1961 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO), was joined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in June 1962, and held its first session in Rome in October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/the-foundation-history-of-codex/en/ Codex timeline from 1945 to the present]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's main goals are to [[consumer protection|protect the health of consumers]] and ensure fair practices in the international food trade. The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]] as an international reference point for the [[Dispute resolution|resolution of disputes]] concerning food safety and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/15sps_01_e.htm Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures] World Trade Organization. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/Publications/understanding/Understanding_EN.pdf Understanding the Codex Alimentarius]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Preface. Third Edition. Published in 2006 by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, there were 186 members of the Codex Alimentarius Commission: 186 member countries and one member organization, the [[European Union]] (EU). There were 215 Codex observers: 49 [[intergovernmental organization]]s, 150 [[non-governmental organization]]s, and 16 [[United Nations System|United Nations organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/members-observers/observers/en/ Observers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or [[raw food|raw]]. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as [[Food labelling regulations|food labeling]], food [[hygiene]], [[food additives]] and [[pesticide]] residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern [[biotechnology]].  It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental [[import]] and [[export]] inspection and [[certification]] systems for foods.

The Codex Alimentarius is published in the six [[official languages of the United Nations]]: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CODEX Alimentarius: Understanding Codex|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/understanding-codex/en/|publisher=FAO and WHO|accessdate=6 September 2012|year=1999|quote=Understanding Codex is available in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian version.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Not all texts are available in all languages.

===General texts===
* [[Food labelling]] (general standard, guidelines on [[nutrition]] labelling, guidelines on labelling claims)
* [[Food additive]]s (general standard including authorized uses, specifications for food grade chemicals)
* [[Contaminant]]s in foods (general standard, tolerances for specific contaminants including [[radionuclide]]s, [[aflatoxin]]s and other [[mycotoxin]]s)
* [[Pesticide]] and veterinary chemical residues in foods (maximum residue limits)
* [[Risk assessment]] procedures for determining the safety of foods derived from biotechnology ([[DNA]]-modified plants, DNA-modified [[micro-organism]]s, [[allergens]])
* Food [[hygiene]] (general principles, codes of hygienic practice in specific industries or food handling establishments, guidelines for the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point or “[[HACCP]]” system)
* Methods of analysis and sampling

===Specific standards===
* [[Meat]] products (fresh, frozen, processed meats and [[poultry]])

* [[Milk]] and milk products
* Foods for special [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] uses (including [[infant formula]] and [[baby food]]s)

* [[Cereal]]s and derived products, dried [[legume]]s
* Fats, oils and derived products such as [[margarine]]
* Miscellaneous food products ([[chocolate]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[mineral water]])

==Controversy==
The controversy over the Codex Alimentarius relates to a perception that it is a mandatory [[Technical standard|standard]] for the safety of food, including vitamin and mineral supplements. Supporters of the Codex Alimentarius say that it is a voluntary reference standard for food and that there is no obligation on countries to adopt Codex standards as a member of either Codex or any other international trade organization. From the point of view of its opponents, however, one of the main causes of concern is that the Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]] as an international reference standard for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proponents argue that the use of Codex Alimentarius during international disputes does not exclude the use of other references or scientific studies as evidence of food safety and consumer protection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

It is reported that in 1996 the German delegation put forward a proposal that no herb, vitamin or mineral should be sold for preventive or therapeutic reasons, and that supplements should be reclassified as drugs.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/sep/14/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth 'Health supplements: R.I.P.'. The Guardian newspaper, UK.] Published 14 September 2002. Accessed 2 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was agreed, but protests halted its implementation.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission was subsequently held July 4–9, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/alinorm05/al28_41e.pdf Codex Alimentarius Commission 28th Session, FAO Headquarters, Rome, Italy, 4-9 July, 2005.

In cases where the intake from the diet is insufficient or where consumers consider their diet requires supplementation, vitamin and mineral food supplements serve to supplement the daily diet."&lt;ref name="codexalimentarius.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN commission adopts safety guidelines for vitamin and food supplements|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=14974&amp;Cr=codex&amp;Cr1|publisher=United Nations News Centre|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=11 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text has been the subject of considerable controversy among proponents of [[dietary supplements]]. Many countries regulate such substances as therapeutic goods or [[pharmaceutical]]s or by some other category, without requiring them to be shown to be medically useful.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The text does not seek to ban supplements, but subjects them to labeling and packaging requirements, sets criteria for the setting of maximum and minimum dosage levels, and requires that safety and efficacy are considered when determining ingredient sources. The [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) will implement these criteria with "labelling to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements." The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the Guidelines call "for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements." The WHO has also said that the Guidelines "ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals."&lt;ref name=un2005 /&gt;

In 2004, similarities were noted between the EU's [[Food Supplements Directive]] and the Codex Alimentarius draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nil by mouth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/feb/29/health.shopping|publisher=The Observer, Guardian UK|accessdate=17 September 2012|author=Rose Shepherd|date=29 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional controversy has been expressed by proponents of ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture and food systems, such as the [[Slow Food]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slowfood.com/international/1/about-us|title=Slow Food International|last=|first=|date=|website=Slow Food International|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905122146/http://www.slowfood.com/international/1/about-us|archive-date=2012-09-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Slow Food movement has become more closely aligned with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slowfood.com About us, Slow Food] "Slow Food gratefully acknowledges funding support from the European Commission."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Manifesto on the Future of Food stated that "bureaucracies like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Codex Alimentarius have codified policies designed to serve the interests of global agribusiness above all others, while actively undermining the rights of farmers and consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manifesto on the Future of Food | author=The International Commission on the Future of Food and Agriculture | date=July 15, 2003 | url=http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/manifestoinglese.pdf | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050602203751/http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/manifestoinglese.pdf | archivedate=June 2, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971''' was the first [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (formerly named the British Commonwealth). It was held in [[Singapore]], between 14 January 1971 and 22 January 1971, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]].

British prime minister [[Edward Heath]] advised [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] not to attend the conference due to a row within the Commonwealth over Britain selling arms to [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 December 2013|title=Only the Queen understands the true value of the Commonwealth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10539479/Only-the-Queen-understands-the-true-value-of-the-Commonwealth.html|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the only CHOGM the Queen would miss until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concern as the Queen misses Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10041931/Queens-absence-from-Commonwealth-meeting-sign-of-changing-role.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugandan president [[Milton Obote]] was overthrown by [[Idi Amin]] in [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|a military coup]], whilst he was attending the meeting.

At the meeting the [[Singapore Declaration|Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles]] was agreed setting out the core political values that would form the main part of the Commonwealth's membership criteria.

{{Communalism}}
{{Libertarian socialism|models}}
&lt;!-- This article not linked within: {{Green politics sidebar}}. --&gt;
'''Communalism''' usually refers to a system that integrates communal ownership and [[federation]]s of highly localized independent communities. A prominent [[libertarian socialist]], [[Murray Bookchin]], defines the Communalism political philosophy that he developed as "a theory of government or a system of government in which independent communes participate in a  federation", as well as "the principles and practice of communal ownership". The term 'government' in this case does not imply an acceptance of a State or top-down hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition,1998, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/cmmnl2.mcw.html|title=What is Communalism? The Democratic Dimension of Anarchism |first=Murray |last=Bookchin |authorlink=Murray Bookchin |date=2006-08-27 |website=dwardmac.pitzer.edu|accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This usage of communalism appears to have emerged during the late 20th century to distinguish [[commune (socialism)|commune]]-based systems from other political movements and/or governments espousing (if not actually practicing) similar ideas. In particular, earlier communities and movements advocating such practices were often described as "[[anarchist]]", "[[socialist]]" and/or "[[communist]]".&lt;ref&gt;See for example the following entries in the 1911 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04179a.htm Ryan, J.A. (1908); "Communism"] and [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14069a.htm Ryan, J.A. (1912). "Socialistic Communities"] (Access date: 12 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical communities practicing [[utopian socialism]] or [[anarcho-communism]] did implement internal rules of communalist property ownership in the context of federated communalism. It is at least theoretically possible for a federation of communes to include communes which do not practice communalist rules of property, which is to say, that the overall national government may be a federation of communes, but that [[private property]] rather than communalist property is the order within each such commune. [[Karl Marx]], often viewed as the founder of modern communism, criticized older forms, including [[primitive communism]] and/or utopian socialism, as poorly conceived and/or prone to disintegration in practice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Karl Marx'', Moscow, {{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communalism in the form described above is distinct from the predominant usage in [[South Asia]]n forms of English: allegiance to a particular ethnic and/or religious group rather than to a broader society.&lt;ref&gt;RH Webster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/communalism.htm|title=Communalism|website=www.countercurrents.org|accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this usage is synonymous with [[sectarianism]] and associated with [[communal violence]].

== History ==

=== Communalism in Christianity ===
{{see also|Christian communism#Communism or communalism}}
In this primarily religious-based community, the communist-like principle of ''[[Koinonia]]'' used by the [[Early Christianity|early Christian Church]] as described in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' (4:32–35), which expressed the broad, general principle of "all things in common" (or, in some translations, "everything in common").

Communalistic tendencies were often present in radical [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era [[Christianity|Christian]] movements in Europe. (This was later argued most famously by the Marxian theorist [[Karl Kautsky]]: see, for example, ''Communism in Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1897/europe/index.htm |title=Karl Kautsky: Communism in Central Europe (1897) |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2003-12-23 |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Some features of [[Waldensian]] movement and associated communes in northern Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries followed certain aspects of communal ownership.

Famously, Czech [[Taborites]] (radical section of the [[Hussite]] movement) in the 15th century attempted to build a society of shared property in the city of [[Tábor]] in south [[Bohemia]].

Certain aspects and streams within the [[German Peasants' War]] in German areas of the 16th century, particularly [[Thomas Müntzer]] and the so-called [[Zwickau prophets]] had a strong social egalitarian spirit.

European [[Radical Reformation]] of [[Anabaptist]] and different groups of [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] started processes which later led to communal movements of [[Shakers]] ,  [[Hutterites]] and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eberhardarnold.com/biography.html|title=Biography of Eberhard Arnold|website=www.eberhardarnold.com|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Anabaptist [[Münster Rebellion]] of 1534–1535 attempted to establish a society based on community of goods.

All of these post-Reformation attempts were led by [[biblical literalism]] in which they referred to previously mentioned passages from the Book of Acts. Radicalism of their social experiments was further heightened by [[chiliasm]] and ardent expectation of [[theocracy]].

The [[Plymouth Colony]] was established by Separatist Pilgrims who had travelled from Europe in order to flee religious persecution and establish a religious community separate from the Church of England. The social and legal systems of the colony were tied to their religious beliefs as well as English Common Law. The presence of secular planters ("The Strangers") hired by the London merchant investors who funded their venture led to tension and factionalization in the fledgling settlement, especially because of the policies of land use and profit-sharing, but also in the way each group viewed workdays and holidays. This form of common [[ownership]] was the basis for the contract agreed upon by the venture and its investors. It was more akin to what we now think of as a privately held corporation, as the common ownership of property and profits was insured by the issuing of stock to the settlers and investors. It was also temporary, with a division of the common property and profits scheduled to take place after seven years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n 1620. July 1.
#The adventurers &amp; planters doe agree, that every person that goeth being aged 16. years &amp; upward, be rated at 10li., and ten pounds to be accounted a single share.
#That he that goeth in person, and furnisheth him selfe out with 10li. either in money or other provissions, be accounted as haveing 20li. in stock, and in [th]e devission shall receive a double share.
#The persons transported &amp; [th]e adventurers shall continue their joynt stock &amp; partnership togeather, [th]e space of 7. years, (excepte some unexpected impedimente doe cause [th]e whole company to agree otherwise,) during which time, all profits &amp; benefits that are gott by trade, traffick, trucking, working, fishing, or any other means of any person or persons, remaine still in ye comone stock until [th]e division.
#That at their coming ther, they chose out such a number of fitt persons, as may furnish their ships and boats for fishing upon [th]e sea; imploying the rest in their severall faculties upon ye land; as building houses, tilling, and planting ye ground, &amp; making shuch comodities as shall be most use full for [th]e collonie.
#That at [th]e end of [th]e 7. years, [th]e capitall &amp; profits, viz. the houses, lands, goods and chatles, be equally divided betwixte ye adventurers, and planters; wch done, every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detrimente concerning this adventure.
#Whosoever cometh to [th]e colonie herafter, or putteth any into [th]e stock, shall at the ende of [th]e 7. years be alowed proportionably to [th]e time of his so doing.
#He that shall carie his wife &amp; children, or servants, shall be alowed for everie person now aged 16. years &amp; upward, a single share in [th]e division, or if he provid them necessaries, a duble share, or if they be between 10. year old and 16., then 2. of them to be reconed for a person, both in transportation and division.
#That such children as now goe, &amp; are under ye age of ten years, have noe other shar in [th]e division, but 50. acers of unmanured land.
#That such persons as die before [th]e 7. years be expired, their executors to have their parte or shaff at [th]e division, proportionably to [th]e time of their life in [th]e collonie.
#That all such persons as are of this collonie, are to have their meate, drink, apparell, and all provissions out of [th]e comon stock &amp; goods of [th]e said collonie.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, William, Of Plymouth Plantation, Chapter 6, pp.56–58&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although each family controlled their own home and possessions, corn was farmed on a communal plot of land with the harvest divided equally amongst the settlers.  The secular planters resented having to share their harvest with families whose religious beliefs so sharply conflicted with their own and as a result shirked work and resorted to thievery, whilst the Pilgrims resented the secular planters taking days off for holidays (especially Christmas) and their frequent carousing and revelry which often left them unfit for work. This conflict resulted in a corn production which was insufficient for the needs of the settlement. Because further supplies from their investors were withheld due to a dispute of the agreed upon payments from the settlement, starvation became imminent. As a result, for the planting of 1623, each family was temporarily assigned their own plot of land to tend with the right to keep all that was harvested from that plot, whether it be sufficient or not and all other production responsibilities and the goods produced therefrom would continue to remain as was originally agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, William, Of Plymouth Plantation, Book 2, 1620–1623, pp. 110–186&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-17th century the [[Diggers|True Levellers]], followers of [[Gerrard Winstanley]], believed in the concept of "levelling men's estates" in order to create equality. They also took over [[common land]] for what they believed to be the common good.

==== The Latter Day Saint movement ====

{{Main|Law of Consecration|United Order}}

In the 19th century the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]&lt;ref&gt;This organization was called the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" at this time; other official names were Church of Christ (1829-1834), Church of the Latter Day Saints (1834-1838), then the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" in 1838. Today, multiple groups claim to be the continuation or successor of Smith's original church, the largest of which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Salt Lake City, Utah; see [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to live a form of Christian communalism called the [[Law of Consecration]], using organizations described as the [[United Order]]. This was established under [[Joseph Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first practiced in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] in the early 1830s. This originally helped [[Latter Day Saints]] with settling in Ohio and was to have helped with building and sustaining entire communities in Missouri, including [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], and [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]]. Subsequent events, including the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]], made it impossible for these communities to thrive.

===== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints =====

{{see also|Bishop's storehouse|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism|ZCMI|l2=Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism}}

After the followers of Brigham Young settled in the [[Utah Territory]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) began to establish a series of community [[cooperative]]s, which were collectively called the [[United Order#The United Order as practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|United Order of Enoch]]. This program was used in at least 200 LDS communities, most of them in outlying rural areas, away from the central Mormon settlements.  Most of the cooperatives lasted for only two or three years before returning to a more standard economic system. One of the last United Order cooperatives was located in [[Orderville, Utah|Orderville]], which continued until an 1885 anti-[[polygamy]] law enforcement action under the [[Edmunds Act]] effectively ended it by jailing many of its leaders.

The [[Law of Consecration]] (as expressed via the LDS Church) was an attempt to base income on a families' actual needs and wants, not on their ability to produce. This was to be done through a strictly voluntary [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]]; it was not deemed acceptable to establish economic equality through force (see also [[Agency (LDS Church)]]). The LDS church has never called this practice communism, instead it has formally stated that, due to matters of spirituality, the United Order and communism are materially opposite in purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Communism and all other similar isms bear no relationship whatever to the United Order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits which Satan always devises of the Gospel plan [...]. The United Order leaves every man free to choose his own religion as his conscience directs. Communism destroys man's God-given free agency; the United Order glorifies it. Latter-day Saints cannot be true to their faith and lend aid, encouragement, or sympathy to any of these false philosophies [...]." (Message of the First Presidency, read by [[J. Reuben Clark]] Jr., 112th Annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]], April 6, 1942.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) =====

[[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], also known as the Cutlerites, are a [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|church]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by Alpheus Cutler and headquartered in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri.  It has operated a functioning United Order since 1913.  The Church of Jesus Christ require membership in the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)#United Order|United Order]] as a condition of membership in the church as The Church of Jesus Christ has reject [[tithing]] and all similar means of finance.  They state that they are attempting to replicate, as far as possible, the idea of "all things common" as taught in the early [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].

=== Secular communalist movements ===

Communalist experiments throughout history have often developed bitter animosities as the parties disputed about the exact issues underlying the confusion over definitions discussed above. The [[Paris Commune]] was one such case.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo J. Sánchez, ''Organizing independence: the artists federation of the Paris Commune and its ...'' {{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libertarian communalism" is a severe and historically justified attempt to organize the political sphere fundamentally and democratically and to give it an ethical content. This is more than a political strategy. This is the desire to move from hidden or emerging democratic opportunities to a radical transformation of society, to a communitarian society focused on human needs, satisfying environmental requirements and developing a new ethic based on solidarity. This means a new definition of politics, a return to the primordial Greek meaning - the management of the community or the polis through the general meeting, on which the principal policy directions are formed, relying on reciprocity and solidarity.

Communalism as a political philosophy was first coined by the well-known [[libertarian socialist]] author and activist Murray Bookchin as a political system to complement his environmental philosophy of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of [[left anarchism]], [[Marxism]], [[syndicalism]], and radical ecology. Politically, Communalists advocate a stateless, classless, decentralized society consisting of a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion.

This primary method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed in principle to taking part in electoral politics &amp;ndash; specifically municipal elections &amp;ndash; as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and anti-statist in policy.

== Politics ==

=== Libertarian municipalism ===
{{main|Libertarian municipalism}}
Starting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the [[Municipality|municipal]] level. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power. The best arena to do that is the municipality — the city, town, and village — where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1980 Bookchin used the term "libertarian municipalism", to describe a system in which [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]] institutions of directly [[democracy|democratic]] assemblies would oppose and replace the [[State (polity)|state]] with a confederation of free municipalities. Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers — the municipal confederations and the nation-state — cannot coexist. Communalists hold that this is a method to achieve a liberated society.

Libertarian municipalism is not seen merely as an effort to "take over" city and municipal councils to construct a more "environmentally friendly" government, but also an effort to transform and democratize these structures, to root them in popular assemblies, and to knit them together along confederal lines to appropriate a regional economy. Bookchin summarized this process in the saying "democratize the republic, then radicalize the democracy".

It is a [[dual power]] that contests the legitimacy of the existing state power. Communalists hold that such a movement should be expected to begin slowly, perhaps sporadically, in communities here and there that initially may demand only the ability to alter the structuring of society before enough interlinked confederations exist to demand the outright institutional power to replace the centralized state. The growing tension created by the emergence of municipal confederations would represent a confrontation between the state and the political realms. It is believed this confrontation can be resolved only after Communalism forms the new politics of a popular movement and ultimately captures the imagination of society at large.

=== Confederalism ===

Communalists see as equally important the need for [[confederation]] – the interlining of communities with one another through recallable [[delegates]] mandated by municipal citizens’ assemblies and whose sole functions are coordinative and administrative. This is similar to the system of "nested councils" found in [[participatory politics]].

According to Bookchin, "[[Confederation]] has a long history of its own that dates back to antiquity and that surfaced as a major alternative to the [[nation-state]]. From the American Revolution through the French Revolution and the Spanish Revolution of 1936, confederalism constituted a major challenge to state centralism". Communalism is seen to add a radically democratic dimension to the contemporary discussions of confederation (e.g. [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]) by calling for confederations not of nation-states but of municipalities and of the neighborhoods of large cities as well as towns and villages.

=== Policy and administration ===
Communalists make a clear distinction between the concepts of ''policy'' and ''administration''. This distinction is seen as fundamental to Communalist principles.

[[Policy]] is defined by being made by a community or neighborhood assembly of free citizens; [[administration (government)|administration]] on the other hand, is performed by confederal councils a level up from the local assemblies which are composed of mandated, recallable [[delegates]] of wards, towns, and villages. If particular communities or neighborhoods –or a minority grouping of them– choose to go their own way to a point where human rights are violated or where ecological destruction is permitted, the majority in a local or regional confederation would have the right to prevent such practices through its confederal council. This is explained not as a denial of democracy but the assertion of a shared agreement by all to recognize [[civil rights]] and maintain the ecological integrity of a region.

Policy-making remains local, but its administration is vested in the confederal network as a whole. The [[confederation]] is intended to be a community of communities based on distinct [[human rights]] and ecological imperatives.

=== Participation in currently existing political systems ===
One of the core distinctions between [[left anarchism]] and Communalism is that Communalists are not opposed in principle to taking part in currently existing political institutions until such a time as it is deemed unnecessary. Communalists see no issues with supporting candidates or political parties in local electoral politics—especially municipal elections—as long as prospective candidates are [[libertarian socialist]] and [[anti-statist]] in policy. The particular goal of this process is to elevate Communalists (or those sympathetic to Communalism) to a position of power so as to construct face-to-face municipal assemblies to maximize [[direct democracy]] and make existing forms of [[representative democracy]] increasingly irrelevant.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Economics ==
{{See also|Criticism of capitalism}}
Communalists are heavily critical of the market economy and capitalism. Believing that these systems destroy the environment by creating a 'grow or die' mentality and creating a large population of [[Social alienation|alienated]] citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communalismpamphlet.net|title=Communalism: A Liberatory Alternative|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They propose abolition of the market economy and money and replaces it with a [[Decentralized planned economy|decentralised planned economy]] controlled by local municipalities and [[Cooperative|cooperatives]].

In such a municipal economy – confederal, interdependent, and rational by ecological, not only technological, standards – Communalists hold that the special interests that divide people today into workers, professionals, managers, capitalist owners and so on would be melded into a general interest (a ''social'' interest) in which people see themselves as citizens guided strictly by the needs of their community and region rather than by personal proclivities and vocational concerns.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;Brown, L. Susan. '[[The Politics of Individualism]],' Black Rose Books (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="work"&gt;Brown, L. Susan.  [http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/brown/sp001735.html Does Work Really Work? ]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, it is hoped, [[citizenship]] would come into its own, and rational as well as ecological interpretations of the public good would supplant [[Class (social)|class]] and hierarchical interests.

== Views on cities ==
Communalists are heavily critical of modern cities, citing urban sprawl, suburbanisation, car culture, traffic congestion, [[noise pollution]] and other negative externalities as having severe effects on the local environment and society as a whole. Communalists propose to run cities democratically and confederally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Communist Workers' Party – For Peace and Socialism''' ({{lang-fi|Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta}}, KTP) is a [[political party]] in [[Finland]]. It was founded in 1988 to secure the existence of an independent [[Marxist-Leninist]] party. Since its founding, it has not gained seats in the parliament, and as a result, has been removed from the party register and re-registered three times.

==History==
The Finnish Communist movement was split in the mid-1980s after years of infighting. Those expelled from the [[Communist Party of Finland]] (SKP) formed the [[Communist Party of Finland (Unity)]] (SKPy) which, however, itself soon split into different factions. KTP was founded in 1988 by one part of Finnish Communists who thought the SKPy had ventured too far from the principles of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The final decision to found a new registered Communist party was made in the autumn 1987 seminar held at [[Matinkylä]]. The Marxist-Leninists behind the project felt themselves neglected since the Dipoli congress of the SKPy in 1986. Many of the KTP cadres came from the (expelled) [[Uusimaa]] district of the SKP which, since the late 1970s, had had its disputes with the opposition of the SKP led by the [[Tiedonantaja|Tiedonantaja society]].

In 2002 the KTP split over question of alliances possible for a Communist party. The Central Committee of the KTP rejected after voting (18–9) a proposed membership in a new (electoral) party, [[Forces for Change in Finland]] (MVS), in which clearly right-wing elements were also going to participate. MVS was supported especially by the [[Helsinki]] district organization of the KTP which then decided to enter the MVS without their comrades. KTP answered by expelling the above-mentioned organization and many leading members of the party, including [[Heikki Männikkö]] (the party secretary),  [[Reijo Katajaranta]] (the editor-in-chief of the KTP organ) and [[Pekka Tiainen]] (the former presidential candidate in 1994), had to go. The Communists expelled then found their own organization, which was at first called plainly ''Communists'', but later changed to [[League of Communists (Finland)|League of Communists]] (or Communist League). The KTP has avoided contacts to their ex-members.

The KTP got some unexpected nationwide, and even international, publicity ahead the local elections in 2004 when the [[Turku]] and [[Raisio]] branches of the party made an electoral alliance with the far-right racist{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[Finnish People's Blue-whites]] (SKS).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The party leadership reacted strongly and condemned the manoeuvres. The alliances were, however, already signed and the KTP candidates stood in the two west coast cities with no success, although the KTP didn't advertise their rebel candidates. The man behind the alliances, [[Esko Luukkonen]], was discharged from all party responsibilities, and he (and the KTP Turku district organization) later joined the League of Communists.

==Politics==
The founders of the KTP were former supporters of the SKP opposition and as such came from the [[Leonid Brezhnev|brezhnevist]] tradition of Marxism-Leninism. The critique of the late [[Soviet Union]] has been, however, included in the party ideology from the beginning. In 1998, for example, the KTP announced that the estimations made on the nature of the era, during the 1970s and the 1980s, were no longer realistic or correct. Yet the Marxism-Leninism of the KTP is far from [[Eurocommunism]]. The party leaders may quote [[Joseph Stalin]] and traditional Leninist rhetoric is required.

The existence of an independent Communist party, which is not buried in any unprincipled coalition, has always been one of the central political issues in the KTP. [[Markus Kainulainen]], probably the best known politician in the KTP, was one of those who, already in 1969, in the then SKP, was in favor of a new party unlike the majority of the party opposition. In the 1980s, the KTP used to criticise the SKPy for not officially registering the party.

The KTP is strictly against the [[European Union]], the [[Euro]] currency and Finland's participation in these capitalist formations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The party has consistently boycotted the elections of [[European Parliament]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The KTP wholeheartedly supports the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK) and its current leadership. The party has published writings of [[Kim Jong-Il]] and many members of the KTP are actively participating in [[The Society for the Study of the Juche Idea|The Society for the Study of the ''Juche'' Idea]].

==Organization==
Every year, the KTP holds its party congresses in which the official delegates choose the members of the important Central Committee. Little change usually happens and Hannu Harju has led the party since the 1997 congress. He was preceded by [[Timo Lahdenmäki]].

The KTP has been a small party all its life and it currently has some 200 members. The candidates of the KTP in the parliamentary elections have failed to get the attention of voters and the party has managed to gather only a few thousand votes. The KTP has some local strongholds, like the city of [[Kemi]] in northern Finland where [[Pirkko Ezewuzie]] is the lone KTP councillor. The party, with its own lists, has also participated in the elections of some trade unions and cooperatives.

The KTP has international contacts even though the party is not a member of any international organization. The [[Russian Communist Workers' Party – Revolutionary Party of Communists]] has warm relations with the KTP as well as the Nordic [[Communist Party of Sweden (1995)|Communist Party of Sweden]] (SKP), [[Communist Party in Denmark]] (KPiD) and [[Communist Party of Norway]] (NKP).

''Työkansan Sanomat'' (TKS), which appears fifteen times a year, is the organ of the KTP. The current editor-in-chief of TKS is [[Hannu Tuominen]]. In local (Helsinki area) Lähiradio radio station the KTP has a weekly program called ''Työväen puolituntinen''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">'''Contentious politics''' is the use of disruptive techniques to make a [[politics|political]] point, or to change government policy. Examples of such techniques are actions that disturb the normal activities of society such as [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], general [[strike action]], [[riot]], [[terrorism]], [[civil disobedience]], and even [[revolution]] or [[insurrection]]. [[Social movements]] often engage in contentious politics.  The concept distinguishes these forms of contention from the everyday acts of resistance explored by [[James C. Scott]], interstate warfare, and forms of contention employed entirely within institutional settings, such as elections or sports.  Historical sociologist [[Charles Tilly]] defines contentious politics as "interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties."&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles. Contentious Performances. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contentious politics has existed forever, but its form varies over time and space.  For example, Tilly argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with the birth of [[social movements]] in 18th-century Europe.  

The concept of contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: [[Sidney Tarrow]], Charles Tilly, and [[Doug McAdam]].  Until its development, the study of contentious politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned with the description and explanation of different contentious political phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution.  One of the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda.&lt;ref&gt;McAdam, Doug, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these three propose.

{{Underlinked|date=January 2015}}

The notion of "policy sciences" may have different connotations. According to [[Harold Lasswell|Harold Laswell]] (1971), "policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order".&lt;ref&gt;Laswell, H.D. (1971). A Preview of Policy Sciences. American Elsevier.  Accessed through http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of the how policies are made and executed.  Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry ad observation as applied to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111103911/http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |archivedate=2014-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy sciences provide an integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems at all levels in ways that help to clarify and secure the common interest. Helping people make better decisions is the central objective of the policy sciences, and the fundamental goal is to foster a commonwealth of human dignity for all. Alexander G. Flor,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences|title = Journal of Development Communication|last = |first = |date = 1991|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ph.D., one of the esteemed development communicators in the [[Philippines]] and also a full professor at the [[University of the Philippines Open University]], points out that "policy scientists or policy analysts are involved not only in the scientific design, formulation, analysis and evaluation of policies. They are also concerned with the study of the policy making process itself". Flor advocates that "if indeed communication and information are to be efficiently and effectively utilized in the development process, then policies are needed to direct their use for the achievement of the highest social good".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The term "policy sciences" is in plural form to emphasize its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomenon that is subject to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented.  Since a problem is multi-dimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon.

==Policy analysis styles==
Dutch policy science experts Mayers, van Daalen and Bots&lt;ref name=Mayers&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.ced.cl/ced/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mayer-et-al_2004.pdf.|title =International Journal of Technology Policy and Management|last =|first =|date =2004|journal =|accessdate =|doi =|pmid =}}{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed policy analysis styles which can be helpful to communication policy analysts and organizational policy analysts, among others. These styles are as follow:

# Rational &lt;br/&gt; This style is "shaped to a large degree by assumptions about knowledge and reality, and by a relatively large distance between the object and subject of study."
# Argumentative &lt;br/&gt; Assumes that "when analyzing policy, it is important to devote attention to aspects related to the language game that takes place around a policy problem or issue".
# Client advice &lt;br/&gt; "Besides knowledge and insights gained through research, policy analysis is largely a question of politico-strategic insight and skills including client-analyst communication."
# Participatory &lt;br/&gt; Assumed that "not all sections of the population have ready access to policy systems; researchers, economic elites, institutionalized non-governmental organizations and politicians dominate policy discussions and decisions about major social issues."
# Process &lt;br/&gt; This is based on the assumption that "substantive aspects of a policy problem are, in fact, coordinate or perhaps even subordinate to the procedural aspects of a policy problem. The analyst or process manager creates 'loose coupling' of procedural aspects and substantive aspects of a problem."
# Interactive &lt;br/&gt;This style assumes that "individuals – experts, analysts, clients, stakeholders and target groups – have or may have differing views of the 'same' policy problem. An insight relevant to policy can be obtained by bringing about a confrontation and interaction of different views."

The styles mentioned above are based on underlying values and orientations, which determine in what way a policy analyst or others will view the quality of the policy analysis study and the criteria that will be applied to examine it. According to Mayer et al.&lt;ref name=Mayers/&gt; these criteria can be made explicit by addressing the following questions:

* Rational style. What is good knowledge?
* Argumentative style. What is good for the debate?
* Client advice style. What is good for the client/problem owner?
* Participatory style. What is good for democratic society?
* Process style. What is good for the process?
* Interactive style. What is good for mutual understanding?

==Theoretical approaches in development communication==

Today, development communication has shifted from modernization and dependency theories to more normative and holistic approaches. The modernization paradigm, which became dominant in the 1945 to 1965, supported the transfer of technology and the socio-political culture of the developed societies to the traditional societies. Development then was defined as economic growth. The main idea of the modernization perspective is the idea of evolution where development is conceived as directional and cumulative, predetermined and irreversible, progressive, and immanent with reference to the nation state. Here, the developed western societies seem to be the ultimate goals which the less developed societies strive to reach. These two sectors, the traditional and the modern, were regarded as two stages of development and in time the differences between them were to disappear because of the natural inclination towards equilibrium. The problem was to remove the barriers, which were only to be found in the traditional society. These barriers can be removed through at least five mechanisms:

# demonstration, whereby the developing world tries to catch up with the more developed by adopting more advanced methods and techniques; 
# fusion, which is the combination and integration of distinct modern methods; 
# compression, whereby the developing countries attempt to accomplish the task of development in less time than it took the developed world; 
# prevention that is, by learning from the 'errors' made by the developed countries; and 
# adaptation of modern practices to the local environment and culture.

Accordingly, the means of modernization were the massive transfer of capital, ideology, technology, and know-how. The measures of progress were G.N.P., literacy, industrial base, urbanization, and the like, all quantifiable criteria.

Communication theories such as the diffusion of innovations, the two-step-flow, or the 'extension' approaches are congruent with the modernization theory. According to Everett Rogers, one of the leading proponents of the diffusion theory, this perspective implies that the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a climate for modernization' among the members of the public (Rogers, 1986).

===Diffusion model===

The 1950s was the decade of the communication model. One of the earliest and most influential of these came not from the social sciences or humanities, but from information engineering. Shannon and Weaver's linear source-transmitter-channel-receiver-destination model eclipsed the earlier, more organic, psychological and sociological approaches. Lasswell, Hofland, Newcomb, Schramm, Westley and Mclean, Berlo, and others each devised a model of communication as they conceived it. This profusion of communication models may be attributed to three reasons. Firstly, because they identified communication basically as the transfer of information, they were amenable to empirical methodology, thus establishing the basis for communication as a distinct and legitimate science. Secondly, theorists focused on the efficiency, or effects, of communication, thereby holding vast promise for manipulation or control of message receivers by vested interests, or the sources. Finally, the communication models fit neatly into the nature and mechanics of mass or mediated communication, an emergent and powerful force at that time. Therefore, in these years, the discipline of communication was largely, and most importantly, its effects. The hypodermic needle effects of media were to be a quick and efficient answer to a myriad of social ills.

Building primarily on sociological research in agrarian societies, Everett Rogers (1973) stressed the adoption and diffusion processes of cultural innovation. Modernization is here conceived as a process of diffusion whereby individuals move from a traditional way of life to a more complex, more technically developed and more rapidly changing way of life. This approach is therefore concerned with the process of diffusion and adoption of innovations in a more systematic and planned way. He distinguishes between five phases in the diffusion process: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption. The role of the mass media is concentrated on the first stage of the process, whereas personal sources are most important at the evaluation stage in the adoption process (Rogers, 1962). In a second edition of his work (Rogers,1973), there are only four crucial steps left in the process of diffusion and adoption: (a) the knowledge of the innovation itself (information), (b) the communication of the innovation (persuasion), (c) the decision to adopt or reject the innovation (adoption or rejection), and (d) the confirmation of the innovation by the individual.

Three more approaches contributed to the success of this diffusion model: that is, a psycho-sociological, institutional and technological interpretation of communication for modernization. The psycho-sociological or behavioristic perspective on communication and modernization is particularly concerned with the individual value and attitude change. Rokeach (1966) defined attitude as a relatively enduring organization of beliefs about an object or situation predisposing one to respond in some preferential manner. Attitude change would then be "a change in predisposition, the change being either a change in the organization or structure of beliefs, or a change in the content of one or more of the beliefs entering into the attitude organization" (Rokeach, 1966; cited in Servaes, 2002). Central in the view of Daniel Lerner (1958), one of the main representatives of this communication for modernization paradigm, is the concept of 'empathy'—the capacity to see oneself in the other fellow's situation. The major hypothesis is that high empathy is predominantly the personal style in modern society, which is distinctively industrial, urban, literate and participant.

Wilbur Schramm (1964), building on Lerner's idea, took a closer look on the perceived connection between mass communication and modernizing practices and institutions. The modern communication media supplement and complement the mobility multipliers—the oral channels of a traditional society. Their development runs parallel to the development of other institutions of modern society, such as schools and industry, and is closely related to some of the indices of general social and economic growth, such as literacy, per capita income, and urbanization. So he claimed that a developing country should give special attention to combining mass media with interpersonal communication (Schramm, 1964; cited in Servaes, 2002).

===Participatory model===

The participatory model incorporates the concepts in the emerging framework of multiplicity. It stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities and of democratization and participation at all levels—international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional receivers. Paulo Freire (1983; cited in Servaes, 2002) refers to this as the right of all people to individually and collectively speak their word. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone—nor can he say it for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words. In order to share information, knowledge, trust, and commitment a right attitude in development projects participation is very important in any decision making process for development. This entails a new attitude for overcoming stereotyped thinking and to promote more understanding of diversity and plurality, with full respect for the dignity and equality of peoples living in different conditions and acting in different ways. (International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, 1980; cited in Servaes, 2002) This model stresses reciprocal collaboration throughout all levels of participation. Listening to what the others say, respecting the counterpart's attitude, and having mutual trust are needed.

Participation involves the more equitable sharing of both political and economic power, which often decreases the advantage of certain groups. Structural change involves the redistribution of power. In mass communication areas, many communication experts agree that structural change should occur first in order to establish participatory communication policies. In fact, Mowlana and Wilson (1987) made this clear by stating that "Communications policies are basically derivatives of the political, cultural and economic conditions and institutions under which they operate. They tend to legitimize the existing power relations in society, and therefore, they cannot be substantially changed unless there are fundamental structural changes in society that can alter these power relationships themselves".

Since dialogue and face-to-face interaction is inherent in participation, the development communicator usually spend more time in the field as rapport and trust take time to develop. This is the reason why continued contact, meeting commitments, keeping promises, and follows up between visits are important. Development of social trust precedes task trust. Both parties will need patience. It is important to note that treating people the way we would like to be treated, we learn to work as a team, and this brings about rural commitment and motivation too. Further, honesty, trust, and commitment from the higher ups bring honesty, trust, and commitment for the grass-roots as well bringing about true participation. And true participation brings about appropriate policies and planning for developing a country within its cultural and environmental framework. Consequently, the perspective on communication also changes. It is more concerned with process and context, that is, on the exchange of meanings, and on the importance of this process, namely, the social relational patterns and social institutions that are the result of and are determined by the process. With this shift in focus, one is no longer attempting to create a need for the information one is disseminating, but one is rather disseminating information for which there is a need. Experts and development workers rather respond than dictate, they choose what is relevant to the context in which they are working. The emphasis is on information exchange rather than on the persuasion in the diffusion model.

==Two major approaches to participatory communication==
There are two major approaches to participatory communication. The first is the dialogical pedagogy of Paulo Freire, and the second involves the ideas of access, participation and self-management articulated in the Unesco debates of the 1970s. Every communication project which calls itself participatory accepts these principles of democratic communication.

The Freirian argument works by a dual theoretical strategy. It is argued that subjugated peoples must be treated as fully human subjects in any political process. This implies dialogical communication. Although inspired to some extent by Sartre's existentialism—a respect for the autonomous personhood of each human being—the more important source is a theology that demands respect for otherness—in this case that of another human being. The second strategy is a moment of utopian hope derived from the early Marx that the human species has a destiny which is more than life as a fulfillment of material needs. Also from Marx is an insistence on collective solutions. Individual opportunity, Freire stresses, is no solution to general situations of poverty and cultural subjugation.

The second discourse about participatory communication is the Unesco language about self-management, access and participation from the 1977 meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The final report of that meeting defines the terms in the following way: Access refers to the use of media for public service. It may be defined in terms of the opportunities available to the public to choose varied and relevant programs and to have a means of feedback to transmit its reactions and demands to production organizations.

Participation implies a higher level of public involvement in communication systems. It includes the involvement of the public in the production process, and also in the management and planning of communication systems. It may be no more than representation and consultation of the public in decision-making. On the other hand, self-management is the most advanced form of participation. In this case, the public exercises the power of decision-making within communication enterprises and is also fully involved in the formulation of communication policies and plans. These ideas are important and widely accepted as a normative theory of alternative communication: it must involve access and participation. However, one should note some differences from Freire. The Unesco discourse includes the idea of a gradual progression. Some amount of access may be allowed, but self-management may be postponed until sometime in the future. The Unesco discourse talks in neutral terms about "the public". Freire talked about the oppressed. Finally, the Unesco discourse puts the main focus on the institution. Participatory radio means a radio station that is self-managed by those participating in it.

==Eastern bloc dissidents==
{{See also|Soviet dissidents}}
The term ''dissident'' was used in the [[Eastern bloc]], particularly in the [[Soviet Union]], in the period following [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death until the [[fall of communism]]. It was attached to citizens who criticized the practices or the authority of the Communist Party. The people who used to write and distribute non-censored, non-conformist ''[[samizdat]]'' literature were criticized in the official newspapers. Soon, many of those who were dissatisfied with the Soviet Bloc began to self-identify as dissidents.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/ Chronicle of Current Events (samizdat)] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This radically changed the meaning of the term: instead of being used in reference to an individual who opposes society, it came to refer to an individual whose non-conformism was perceived to be for the good of a society.&lt;ref name="u"&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208000000/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |date=December 8, 2014 }} General Assembly resolution 217 A (III), [[United Nations]], 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968, U.N.

Some famous Soviet dissents were [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]].

==Republican dissidents in Ireland==
{{See also|Dissident republican}}
The term ''dissident'' has become the primary term to describe [[Irish republicans]] who politically continue to oppose [[Good Friday Agreement of 1998]] and reject the outcome of the [[Belfast Agreement#Referendums|referendums]] on it.  These political parties also have paramilitary wings which espouse violent methods to achieve a [[United Ireland]].

Irish republican dissident groups include the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] (founded in 1974 &amp;ndash; its currently-inactive paramilitary wing is the [[Irish National Liberation Army]]), [[Republican Sinn Féin]] (founded in 1986 &amp;ndash; its paramilitary wing is the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]]), and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] (founded in 1997 &amp;ndash; its paramilitary wing is the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]]).  In 2006 the [[Óglaigh na hÉireann (CIRA splinter group)|Óglaigh na hÉireann]] emerged, which is a splinter group of the Continuity IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7934742.stm |title=Who are the dissidents? |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissidents and activists were among the earliest adopters of [[Encryption|encrypted]] communications technology such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and the [[dark web]], turning to the technology as ways to resist authoritarian regimes, avoid censorship and control and protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|publisher=TEDGlobalLondon|title=How the mysterious dark net is going mainstream|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream?language=en|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=The dilemma of the dark web: protecting neo-Nazis and dissidents alike|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/23/dark-web-neo-nazis-tor-dissidents-white-supremacists-criminals-paedophile-rings|date=23 August 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-darknet-is-the-government-destroying-the-wild-west-of-the-internet-198271/|title=The Darknet: Is the Government Destroying 'the Wild West of the Internet?'|work=Rolling Stone|author=David Kushner|date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tor was widely used by protestors on Mubarak regime in Egypt in 2011. Tor allowed dissidents to communicate anonymously and securely, while sharing sensitive information. Also, Syrian rebels widely used Tor in order to share with the world all of the horrors that they witnessed in their country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cryptopolitik and the Darknet|journal=Survival (00396338)|volume= 58| issue = 1, p7-38. 32p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, government dissidents in Lebanon, Mauritania, as well as Arab Spring nations widely used Tor in order to stay safe while exchanging their ideas and agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Croke|first1=Paul|title=Dark Net: Secret basement of the Internet|url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/dark-net-secret-basement-internet/2015/07/15|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=Baltimore Post-Examiner|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
'''Governance''' comprises all of the processes of governing - whether undertaken by the [[government]] of a [[state (polity) | state]], by a [[market (economics) |market]] or by a [[social network| network]] - over a [[social system]] ([[family]], [[tribe]], [[formal organization |formal]] or [[informal organization]], a [[territory]] or across territories) and whether through the [[laws]], [[norm (social) |norm]]s, [[political power|power]] or [[language]] of an organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Bevir |first= Mark |title= Governance: A very short introduction |year= 2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ozjcWIfhoO8C | quote = Governance refers, therefore, to all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [[social norm]]s and [[institution]]s".&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.

A variety of entities (known generically as '''governing bodies''') can govern. The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.

In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]] , community and [[Media (communication) | media]].

==Origin of the word==
{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}
Like ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase "governance of the realm" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]&lt;ref name="TyndaleFrith1831"&gt;"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert..." {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in [[Charles Plummer]]’s ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf Étymologie du terme "gouvernance"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.

===Governance as process===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]]. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," ''Journal of Law and Economics'': Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public governance===
{{main|Public administration}}
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus, (2009) Governance: An “Empty Signifier”? ''Constellations,'' 16: 550–62. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between "politics" and "administration". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both "governance" and "politics" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].

In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].

===Private governance===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, [[dispute resolution organizations]], or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the "quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68–70 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public policy" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is "governmental policy," which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

===Global governance===
{{main|Global governance}}
Global governance is defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional meaning of "governance", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term "global governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.

===Governance Analytical Framework===
The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and "nodal points". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research. In: Wiesmann, U., Hurni, H., et al. editors. Research for Sustainable Development: Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives. |year=2011 |location=Bern |publisher=Geographica Bernensia: 165–183.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Cornforth &amp; Aiken, 2009. The governance challenges of social enterprises: Evidence from a UK empirical study. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 89(2): 247–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonprofit governance===
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.

===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:
# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation
# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction

Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

The first documented use of the word "corporate governance" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&amp;nbsp;108) to denote "the structure and functioning of the corporate polity". The "corporate government" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).

===Project governance===
{{main|Project governance}}
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.

===Environmental governance===
{{main|Environmental governance}}

===Land governance===
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘[[land grabbing]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus on Land in Africa (http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.  For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ VGGT]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).

===Internet governance===
{{main|Internet governance}}

===Information technology governance===
{{main|Information technology governance}}
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php
| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory governance===
{{main|Regulatory governance}}
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;David Levi-Faur, "Regulation &amp; Regulatory Governance", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi‐Faur. "Can regulation and governance make a difference?." Regulation &amp; Governance 1.1 (2007): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract governance===
(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilevel governance===
{{main|Multilevel governance}}

===Metagovernance===
"Metagovernance" is the "governing of governing".&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can "potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98–114 (p. 103).&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,&lt;ref&gt;Onyango, P &amp; Jentoft, S. Assessing Poverty in small-scale fisheries in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.''Fish and Fisheries''. Volume 11 2010, pp. 250–63 (p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; and media focus on specific issues&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, J. ''Environmental Governance''. Routledge 2012. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative governance===
{{See also|Collaborative governance}}
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.&lt;ref name="Vitasek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security sector governance ===
{{See also|Security sector governance}}Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a normative concept==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. "Good governance" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the "agents") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the "principals"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].

===Good governance===
{{Main|Good governance}}
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.

The [[World Bank]] defines governance as:
{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development – The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:
{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:
{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:

{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the "proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).&lt;ref&gt;This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), "Governance Working Group", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are [http://gaportal.org/country-initiatives country-led assessments] that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | year =  | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 – An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = Gütersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110418/http://xml.fido.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10 Section 10] of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/major-ibp-initiatives/open-budget-initiative/ Open Budget Initiative] in 2006 with the release of the first [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/ Open Budget Survey (OBS)]. The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created [http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings Open Budget Index] (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new [http://www.obstracker.org/ OBS Tracker], which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries], retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of country-led assessments include the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/indonesia Indonesian Democracy Index], monitoring of the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/mongolia Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia] and the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/bhutan Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan].

Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

Conservation is a positive endeavour  including “… the preservation, maintenance, sustainable  use, restoration, and enhancement  of the natural environment”.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, UNEP and  WWF,  World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable  Development, IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protected Areas|Protected Area]] is "“...a  clearly defined geographical space,  recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means,  to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated [[ecosystem services]] and cultural values”.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N. (Editor) (2008). Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. x + 86pp. {{ISBN|978-2-8317-1086-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This IUCN definition applies  equally to land, inland waters and coastal and marine territories and areas  and is widely considered  to be equivalent to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition.

[[Governance]] is (the process of) “…interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say…”.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J., Amos, B., Plumptre, T., 2003. Governance Principles for Protected Areas in the 21st century. Institute On Governance in collaboration with Parks Canada and Canadian International Development Agency, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; In less elegant, but possibly clearer words, governance is about taking decisions and ensuring the conditions for their effective implementation. It is the process of developing and exercising authority and responsibility over time. It is about who takes decisions, and how, including in relation to learning processes and evolving institutions in society.

Governance is related to management but different from it. What is the difference? Management is about what is done in pursuit of given objectives. Governance is about who decides about what is to be done, and how those decisions are taken. It is about who holds power, authority and responsibility and who is, or should be, held accountable. Governance is nothing new: someone, somewhere, has always  been taking decisions  about  protected and conserved areas. What is new is that we are now paying  better attention to governance, adding visibility, articulating concepts, and monitoring and evaluating  practice. There is no ideal governance setting for protected  or conserved areas, but a set of “good  governance” principles  can  always  be taken into account. Governance is appropriate only when tailored  to its specific context and effective in delivering lasting conservation  results, livelihood benefits and the respect  of rights.

== Why governance? ==
Governance can be  improved and provide precious help  in facing  on-going challenges and global change. 
* Governance is the variable  with greatest  potential  to affect conservation coverage.
* Governance is a main factor in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of management.
* Governance is a determinant  of appropriateness and equity of decisions.
* Governance can  ensure that protected  areas are better embedded in society.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, A., “Turning ideas  on their head – the new paradigm for protected  areas”, pages 1-28  in Jaireth, H. and  D. Smyth, Innovative Governance, Ane Books, Delhi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance at the IUCN World Parks Congress ==

The [[IUCN|IUCN World Parks Congress]] is held once every decade. Since the Congress in [[Durban]] (2003), governance has been a recurring stream in the deliberations of the Congress. [http://www.worldparkscongress.org/programme/stream_enhancing_the_diversity_and_quality_of_governance.html Governance] was also a major stream at the [[IUCN World Parks Congress 2014]]. The stream, among other things, published a [http://worldparkscongress.org/drupal/node/82 primer] to develop a basic lexicon in the hope that speaking “a common language” may help to better communicate and develop concepts of increasing clarity and meaning.

== Governance Diversity ==

We speak of governance  diversity for protected and conserved areas  when decisions are made by a variety of actors who enrich and strengthen conservation in practice.  For instance, a national system of protected areas  can “enhance  governance  diversity” by including in the system areas  governed by different types of actors and under different arrangements,  and/or by providing better recognition and support to conserved territories and areas  outside the system.

=== Four main governance types ===

The [[IUCN]] and [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] distinguish four broad governance types for protected and conserved areas&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention  on Biological Diversity (SCBD), Biodiversity Issues for Consideration in the Planning, Establishment and Management of Protected Area Sites and Networks, CBD Technical Series no 15,  SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; according to the actors who take or took the fundamental decisions about them (e.g. the actors that “established” them and decided their main purpose and management).
The four main governance types are:
*Type A. governance by government (at various levels and possibly combining various agencies)
*Type B. governance by various rightsholders and stakeholders together (shared governance)
*Type C. governance by private individuals and organizations (usually the landholders)
*Type D. governance by indigenous peoples and/or local communities (often referred to as ICCAs)

=== ICCAs ===

[[Indigenous and community conserved area|ICCAs]] is an abbreviation that refers to the territories and  areas conserved  by indigenous peoples  and  local communities. There are three essential characteristics common to ICCAs:&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  B. Lassen, S. Stevens, G. Martin, JC Riasco de la Peña,  E. Raéz Luna and M.T. Farvar, Bio-cultural Diversity Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples &amp; Local Communities: Examples &amp; Analysis,  IUCN, UNDP GEF SGP, GIZ and  CENESTA, Tehran, 2010 (reprinted  2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, A. with C. Corrigan, H. Jonas,  A. Neumann, and  H. Shrumm (eds.), Recognising  and Supporting  Territories and Areas Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples And  Local Communities: Global  Overview and National  Case  Studies,  CBD Technical Series no. 64,  Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, ICCA Consortium, IUCN/TILCEPA, Kalpavriksh and  Natural Justice, SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* an indigenous people  or local community possesses a close and  profound  relation with a site (territory, area or habitat)
* the people  or community is the major player  in decision- making related  to the site and  has de facto and/or de jure capacity to develop  and  enforce  regulations
* the people’s or community’s decisions and efforts lead to the conservation of biodiversity, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless  of original or primary motivations

Management categories and governance types are independent and can be juxtaposed in the “IUCN Matrix”,&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; visualizing a spectrum of area-based options to conserve nature in a given region/ system. The IUCN Matrix can be used to situate protected areas but also conserved territories and areas (the management category, in such case, would not correspond to a key objective but to an observed result).

Conservation depends on well governed systems of protected  and  conserved  areas in the landscape and  seascape and systems  are  made  stronger  by governance  diversity.

=== Conserved Territories or Areas ===
Conserved  territories or areas are  “…area-based measure  that— regardless of recognition  and dedication and  at times even regardless of explicit and  conscious  management practices—  achieve conservation de facto and/or is in a positive conservation trend and  likely to maintain this trend in the long term…”.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press)&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition applies  equally to land,  inland  waters  and coastal  and  marine territories and  areas.
The governance types apply  to both protected  areas and  conserved territories and  areas that are  NOT recognised as “protected” by the IUCN or any specific national  government.  In this sense,  the terms “Privately Conserved  Areas”  and  “ICCAs” encompass extents of land, inland waters and  coastal  and  marine  territories and  areas that go beyond  those recognised as “protected” by either national  government  or the IUCN.

===Voluntary and ancillary conservation===
Many systems of land and  water  management support high levels of biodiversity,  including critical biodiversity,  outside the formal system of protected  areas, in sites such a tourism and commercial hunting reserves,  private  estates  or village forests. The term voluntary  conservation &lt;ref&gt;Lausche, B. and  F. Burhenne,  Guidelines  for Protected Area Legislation, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2011&lt;/ref&gt; captures the idea  that those who exercise governance do so consciously and  without restriction, in ways that are  fully compatible with conserving biodiversity values while they may or not see conservation as the primary objective  of their management efforts. In other cases, as in military no-go areas or areas abandoned after a natural or man-made  disaster,  the term ancillary conservation is more appropriate, since conservation is an entirely unintended (though welcome) consequence of management for other purposes.
Conservation in the landscape and  seascape is the result of various area-based and  non-area- based measures. Among area-based measures  we find both protected  areas and  conserved territories and areas. Crucially, those should be biologically,  but also socially, well connected.

===Systems of protected  and conserved  areas===
A well-functioning  system of  protected   and  conserved  areas is complete and well-connected in conserving  the representative features  and  functions of nature  in a given environment.

===Other effective area- based conservation measures (OECMs)===
The term “other effective area-based conservation measures”– abbreviated as OECMs—is used by the Convention on Biological Diversity to refer to territories and areas that are  effectively conserved but not part of the official protected  area system of a given country. In this sense,  OECMs can  be seen as “clearly defined  geographical space where  de facto conservation of nature  and  associated ecosystem services and  cultural values is achieved and  expected to be maintained in the long-term regardless of specific recognition  and  dedication”  (11). OECMs can include the following:
* Primary voluntary conservation that the national  government  does  not wish to recognise as a protected  area
* Primary voluntary conservation that refuses the protected  area label and/or inclusion in the national  system (e.g.  because of self- determination  and  self-governance  issues)
* Secondary voluntary conservation
* Ancillary conservation with a reasonable expectation to be maintained in the long-term
The following Table summarises  various ways of classifying conservation efforts and  results:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Conserved  areas (conserved de facto with a reasonable expectation that conservation will be maintained in the long term) !! Conservation  of nature  is the primary management objective !! Conservation  of nature  is not the primary management objective
|-
| The State government recognizes  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected  area both according to the IUCN and  in the country at stake || The area is a protected area in the country at stake, although  not internationally; it likely comprises  voluntary conservation; it can  comprise ancillary conservation; it can be considered an OECM from an international  point 
|-
| The State government does not recognize  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected area according to the IUCN (but not recognized as such nationally); the area most likely comprises  voluntary conservation; the IUCN recommends to nationally consider  it as an OECM
 || The area is neither recognized as a protected area nationally  nor internationally;  it likely comprises  voluntary conservation and/or ancillary conservation; the area can  be considered nationally  as an OECM

==Governance quality==

===IUCN principles  of good governance for protected  areas===
We  speak  of governance quality when decisions  are  made  while respecting the “good governance” principles developed through time by a variety of peoples, nations  and  UN agencies. A simple and compact  formulation of the “IUCN principles  of good  governance for protected  areas”,&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;  includes:

* Legitimacy and  voice— i.e. enjoying broad acceptance and appreciation in society; ensuring procedural rights of access  to information, participation  and justice; fostering engagement and  diversity; preventing  discrimination; fostering subsidiarity, mutual respect,  dialogue, consensus  and  agreed rules…
* Direction— i.e. following an inspiring and  consistent strategic  vision grounded on agreed values and  an appreciation of complexities; ensuring consistency with policy and practice  at various levels; ensuring clear answers  to contentious questions;  ensuring proper  [[adaptive management]] and  favouring the emergence of champions  and  tested innovations…
* Performance—i.e. achieving  conservation  and  other objectives as planned; promoting a culture of learning;  engaging in advocacy and  outreach;  being  responsive  to the needs  of rightsholders  and  stakeholders; ensuring resources  and  capacities and  their efficient use; promoting sustainability and  resilience…
* Accountability—i.e.  upholding  integrity and  commitment; ensuring appropriate access  to information and  transparency, including for lines of responsibility, allocation of resources,  and  evaluation  of performances; establishing  communication avenues  and encouraging feed-back  and  independent overseeing…
* Fairness and rights—i.e. striving towards equitably shared costs and benefits, without adverse impact for vulnerable people; upholding decency and the dignity of all; being fair, impartial, consistent, non discriminatory, respectful of procedural rights as well as substantive rights, individual and collective human rights, gender equity and the rights of indigenous peoples, including Free, Prior and Informed Consent; promoting local empowerment in conservation…

Thus, a “good governance” situation is one in which decisions  are  taken legitimately, competently,  fairly, with sense  of vision, accountability and  while respecting rights.

===Equitable and effective governance===
The IUCN good  governance situation can  also be summed up as “equitable and  effective governance”. The criteria of legitimacy,  voice, fairness and  (procedural and  substantive) rights contribute to equitable governance. The criteria of direction,  performance and  accountability lead  to governance that is effective.

===Substantive and  procedural rights===
Rights are  usefully distinguished  between substantive and  procedural. Procedural  rights, such as the rights to information,  participation and  access to justice, govern the process  of determining  and adjudicating substantive rights. In turn, substantive rights refer
to the specific powers  and  obligations of individuals and  collective bodies  under accepted customs and legislation.  They span  from basic human  rights (e.g. life, liberty) to material  and  financial rights under specific contractual conditions  (e.g.  access  to a given territory). Procedural  and  substantive rights deserve  respect  in relation to both protected
and  conserved areas and  territories

==Governance vitality==
We  speak  of governance vitality when decision-making actors and  institutions are functional, responsive and  thriving, meeting their role and  responsibilities in timely and appropriate ways. Vitality is expressed  by several of these properties:

* Integration and  connectivity —i.e. having abundant and  meaningful interactions with diverse actors, sectors and  levels of decision-making in society, including those interactions that characterise a system versus scattered  and  isolated single protected  areas, and those interactions that render  decisions effective through the generation of political, social and financial support…
* Adaptability –i.e. being reflexive and  flexible, able to accommodate circumstances, integrate knowledge  from different cultures, learn from experience and  weigh options through dialogue, exchanges, experiment and  debate…  able to take rapid  and  meaningful decisions even under challenging  circumstances...
* Wisdom —i.e. being aware  and respectful of the socio-ecological history and traditional worldviews, knowledge  and  values of the relevant environment and  communities; governing situations of meaningful scope  (e.g. regarding the size and  coherence of the units to manage, the number of actors to involve…) and  in line with solidarity rather than self-interest only (e.g. sharing benefits, avoiding  accumulation  and  waste,  keeping  in mind future generations); not only allowing, but fostering the engagement of as many relevant actors in society as possible…
* Innovation and  creativity — i.e. openness  to new ideas,  ability to re-invent and  renew itself as only a living system does,  ability to conceive and  implement new solutions, support the emergence of new rules and  norms, respond  positively to change and continue to develop…
* Empowerment  – i.e. being self-conscious, self-directed, willing and  capable of demonstrating leadership, such as by organizing timely responses  to emerging  environmental conditions, problems and opportunities… but also being self-disciplined and  self-critical, able to take on responsibilities in effective and  dependable ways…
 
While governance diversity and  quality have  been  explored rather  exhaustively,  the concept of governance vitality has only recently been  identified for further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;  All governance properties  are  open  to enrichment and  debate.

==How does  governance improve?==
The IUCN and  CBD have recently published a volume of Guidelines for assessing,  evaluating  and planning  for action with a view to improving governance for a system of protected  areas or a specific site.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases,  the methodology  begins with an analysis of the historical, socio-cultural, institutional and  legal contexts. It then proceeds with a spatial analysis of governance vis-à-vis the status of conservation of nature.  This requires a large,  territorial view of the region or area  under consideration, including an assessment of biological,  ecological  and  cultural values and  their potential association  with governance diversity, quality and  vitality. From that, valuable  lessons can be derived and  action plans for improvement can be drawn.

Globally, there remains a need to initiate such systematic governance assessments and evaluations processes in a range of contexts, with the aim and expectation that they will catalyze enhanced  diversity, quality and vitality. A structured programme of governance  assessments, supported by learning and capacity development networks is a short and medium term priority to strengthen both conservation policies and results.

The '''history of public transport authorities in Manchester''' details the various organisations that have been responsible for the public transport network in and around [[Manchester]], England, since 1824.

==Timeline==
*On 1 January 1824, the first horse bus service started by [[John Greenwood (bus operator)|John Greenwood]], the proprietor of the [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] Toll Gates
*On 1 March 1865, the [[Manchester Carriage Company]] was formed which brought together a number of horse-bus operators in the Manchester area.
*In 1880 this became the [[Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company]] with some further consolidation, including the [[Manchester Suburban Tramways Company]].
*On 7 June 1901, [[Manchester Corporation Tramways| Manchester Corporation Tramways Department]] started electric tram operations, as the public operation. The former Carriage Company was wound up in 1903
*In 1929 the name was changed to  Manchester Corporation Transport Department to reflect the changing to motor buses
*In mid-1966 the name of this public operation was changed to Manchester City Transport.
*On 1 November 1969, control of Manchester City Transport and other surrounding council transport departments were transferred to South East Lancashire North East Cheshire Passenger Transport Executive (SELNEC PTE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selnec.org.uk/gmt_beyond.htm Greater Manchester Transport and beyond] Selnec Preservation Society&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 1 April 1974, SELNEC'S operating name became Greater Manchester Transport, and its coverage was expanded.
*During 1974 Greater Manchester Transport was rebranded as the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]] (GMPTE). This lasted until 2011.
**On 27 February 1986, Greater Manchester Transport's bus operation was transferred to a separate entity, Greater Manchester Buses Limited,&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01992869 Companies House extract company no 1992869] Greater Manchester Buses Limited&lt;/ref&gt; to comply with the [[Transport Act 1985]], adopting the [[GM Buses]] trading name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/26th-july-1986/18/11-tyne-and-wear-passenger-transport-executive-and Tyne &amp; Wear Passenger Transport Executive and Greater Manchesger] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' 26 July 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
**On 13 December 1993, GM Buses was further split into GMB North&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02818607 Companies House extract company no 2818607] First Manchester Limited formerly Greater Manchester Buses North Limited&lt;/ref&gt; and GMB South&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02818654 Companies House extract company no 2818654] Greater Manchester Buses South Limited&lt;/ref&gt; on an approximate geographic basis. Just under four months later they were sold to [[Management buyout|employee buy out]] teams.
**In February 1996, GMB South was sold to [[Stagecoach Group]],  becoming [[Stagecoach Manchester]].
**In March 1996, GMB North was sold to [[FirstGroup|First Bus]], eventually becoming [[First Greater Manchester]].{{r|TransportMuseum}}
*In April 2011. GMPTE became [[Transport for Greater Manchester]] (TfGM).{{r|TFGM}}

[[Jewish history|Jewish communities]] have existed across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. By the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]], [[Persian Jews|Persian]], [[Jews in Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Hellenistic Jews|Greek]], [[Roman Jews|Roman]], [[Byzantine Jews|Byzantine]], [[Old Yishuv|Ottoman]] and [[Yemenite Jews]].

[[Islamic–Jewish relations|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[second-class citizen]]s, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as "[[people of the book]]". During [[Jews in the Middle Ages|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many [[Jewish refugees|Jews found refuge]] in Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were invited to settle in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of merchants [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers]].

Today, Jews residing in [[Muslim countries]] have been [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|reduced to a small fraction]] of their [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|former sizes]], with [[Jews in Iran|Iran]] and [[Jews in Turkey|Turkey]] being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.

==Middle Ages==

===Muslim conquests===
{{main|History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula}}
There were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in [[Arabia]]. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews – as many as 80,000 – arrived after the destruction of the [[First Temple]], to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of [[Khaybar]] as well as the trading colonies in [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] (where they had their own [[cemetery]]). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from [[Byzantine]] persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of [[Kohanim]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], written shortly after [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]], addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews "will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs", and they "shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs". After the [[Battle of Badr]], the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]] breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as [[casus belli]] and besieged the [[Banu Qaynuqa]]. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the [[Banu Nadir]], accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, [[Banu Qurayza]] was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the [[Battle of the Trench]]. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as [[Banu Awf]], [[Banu Harith]], [[Banu Jusham]] [[Banu Alfageer]], [[Banu Najjar]], [[Banu Sa'ida]], and [[Banu Shutayba]].&lt;ref&gt;Stillman ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irvin and Sunquist, ''History of the World Christian Movement'', Vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2001), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

In year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph [[Umar]] decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabia—a decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: "Let there not be two religions in Arabia". The two populations in question were the Jews of the [[Khaybar]] oasis in the north and the Christians of [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003) p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Red Sea port of [[Jeddah]] was permitted as a "religious quarantine area" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants.

===During the Caliphates===
[[Image:Al-andalus_229.png|thumb|A Jew and a Muslim playing chess in 13th century [[al-Andalus]].]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R. "[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History]." ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} Some historians refer to this time period as the "Golden Age" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt; In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the [[Pact of Umar]] and the traditional [[Dhimmi]] status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century [[Granada]], were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling (2005), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|55}} For example, the [[vizier]] of [[Baghdad]] entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and [[Siraf]], the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor.&lt;ref&gt;Poliakov (1974), pg.68-71&lt;/ref&gt; Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} [[Leon Poliakov]] writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there.

Although Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}}  Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the [[Pact of Umar]] was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} Since the 11th century, there have been instances of [[pogrom]]s against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[1066 Granada massacre]], the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the [[Al-Andalus|Andalucian]] city of [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North Africa]], there were cases of violence against Jews in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html|title=The Jews of Morocco}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other Arab lands including [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/egjews.html|title=The Jews of Egypt|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/syrianjews.html|title=The Jews of Syria|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yemen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/yemenjews.html|title=The Jews of Yemen|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 15th century, the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as [[mellah]]s. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a [[fortified gateway]]. Rural ''mellahs'', however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad]]s, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the [[Almoravides]], and they treated the ''dhimmis'' harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from [[Morocco]] and [[Islamic Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051923/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of [[Maimonides]], fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim], ''Jewish Virtual Library'', Rebecca Weiner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, Joel L., ''Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides'' pp. 16-17 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1465, Arab mobs in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsje.org/Jews%20Kicked%20out%20of%20Arab%20Lands%20Part%202.htm Jews kicked out of Arab Countries Part 2: The Persecution of Jews prior to 1948], Historical Society of Jews from Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} {{dubious|date=April 2017}} The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Seljuk Empire (1077-1307) and early Ottoman rule===
{{main|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
Jews have lived in [[Asia Minor]] for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries{{fact|date=November 2018}}, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] forces after the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Early Modern Period==

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] served as a [[refugees|refuge]] for [[History of the Jews in Spain#Number of the exiles|Jewish refugees]] from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish empire]], especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and [[Alhambra decree|Edict of Expulsion]]. This continued through the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], as secret Jews and [[Marranos|forced converts]] continued to flee Spain. The [[Maghreb]] from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (''[[Mellah]]s'').

[[Image:Jews in Jerusalem 1890s.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Jews in Jerusalem, in the 1890s.]]
In 1834, in [[Safed]], [[Ottoman Syria]], local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the [[Old Yishuv|Jewish population]] known as the [[Safed Plunder]].&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;Bloch, Abraham P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjxJAFawRasC&amp;pg=PA168 One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries], 1987. pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Finkelstein|title=The Jews: their history, culture, and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-QDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2012|year=1960|publisher=Harper|page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/reaction.html Americans React to Damascus Blood Libel]&lt;/ref&gt; A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jews of Libya]] were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]]. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]] looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

====Kurdistan====
{{main|Kurdish Jews}}
Jews lived in [[Kurdistan]] for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbakır in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the ''agha'', the landlord or head of the village.

===Persia===
{{main|Persian Jews|History of the Jews in Iran}}
In 1656, all Jews were expelled from [[Isfahan]] and [[forced to convert to Islam]] because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice [[Judaism]] in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of ''jizya'' collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.&lt;ref name="littman1"&gt;Littman (1979), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori.

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote of [[Persian Jews]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered."''&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bukhara===
A number of groups of [[Persian Jews]] have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the [[Bukharian Jews]] and [[Mountain Jew]]s.

Confined to [[ghetto|city quarters]], the [[Bukharan Jews]] were denied basic rights and many were forced to [[Chala (Jews)|convert]] to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Bukharan_Jews.html Bukharan Jews], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zaydi Yemen===

Under the [[Zaydi]] rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the [[Yemenite Jews]], which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the [[Exile of Mawza]]. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Communities in Exotic Places," by Ken Blady, [[Jason Aronson]] Inc., 2000, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab League===
{{further| Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
By the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|had left, fled or had been expelled]] from Arab and Muslim-majority  countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.&lt;ref name=Shenhav&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.&lt;ref name=Shenhav/&gt; In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]], which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the [[American Jews|United States]] today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

The largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in [[Morocco]] with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.

===Imperial Iran and Islamic Republic===
Judaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after [[Zoroastrianism]]. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in [[Iran]], mostly in [[Tehran]] and [[Hamedan]]. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Today, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in [[Israel]] (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the [[United States]] (45,000, especially in the [[Los Angeles]] area, home to a large concentration of [[expatriate]] Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15961">The '''Investment theory of party competition''' is a [[political theory]] developed by [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]], Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The theory focuses on how business elites, not voters, play the leading part in political systems. The theory offers an alternative to the conventional, voter-focused, [[realignment election#Realignment theory|Voter Realignment theory]] and [[Median voter theorem]], which has been criticized by Ferguson and others.

==History==
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' was first outlined by Thomas Ferguson in his 1983 paper ''Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective|journal=Research in Political Economy|date=1983|volume=6|pages=1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is detailed most extensively in Ferguson's 1995 book ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-driven Political Systems'', in which his earlier paper is republished as a chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Golden Rule : The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226243176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ferguson frames his theory as being both inspired by and an alternative to the traditional median voter theories of democracy such as that posited by [[Anthony Downs]] in his 1957 work ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Downs, Ferguson accepts that 'the expense of political awareness is so great that no citizen can afford to bear it in every policy area, even if by doing so he could discover places where his intervention would reap large profits'. While Downs largely overlooked the implications of this insight, Ferguson makes it the foundation of the ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'', recognizing that if voters cannot bear the cost of becoming informed about public affairs they have little hope of successfully supervising government.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The real market for political parties is defined by major investors, who generally have good and clear reason for investing to control the [[Sovereign state|state]]....Blocs of major investors define the core of political parties and are responsible for most of the [[Political campaign|signals the party sends to the electorate]].|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.206&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The central claim of the ''Investment Theory'' is that since ordinary citizens cannot afford to acquire the information required to invest in political parties, the political system will be dominated by those who can. As a result, the investment theory holds that rather than being seen as simple vote maximizers, political parties are best analyzed as blocs of investors who coalesce to advance candidates representing their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of political parties===
Contrary to the median voter theorem where political parties have traditionally been seen as vote maximizers who will seek out the position of the 'median voter' on any particular issue, the ''Investment Theory'' holds the real area of competition for political parties is major investors who have an interest in investing to control the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, in situations where money is important, political parties must take positions that enable them to attract the investment required to run successful campaigns. This is the case even if those positions are not supported by the majority of the population, since it is futile for a party to adopt even a popular position if it cannot afford the expense of communicating that position to the electorate in an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the ''Investment theory'' predicts that in many cases political parties are more likely to try and change the position of the public to match those of its investors than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead political parties will try to assemble the votes they need through appeals to the electorate on issues that do not conflict with the interests of their investors. Vigorous debate may take place on issues where an opposing bloc of investors is able to mobilize and advertise their position. A further consequence of this theory is that in policy areas where large investors agree on policy, no party competition will take place. This is the case regardless of the views of the general population, unless ordinary citizens are able to become major investors in their own right through expenditure of time and income.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of ordinary voters===
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' does not deny the possibility that masses of voters can become major investors in an electoral system, and accepts that in cases where this does happen the effect may resemble classical voter competition models. For this to happen, however, generally requires channels that facilitate mass deliberation and expression, typically 'secondary' organizations capable of spreading the cost of acquiring information and concentrating contributions from many individuals to act politically. Such conditions may enable high information flows to the general population and make political debate and action a part of everyday life. Where these conditions do not exist, however, it is unlikely that ordinary citizens will be able to afford the costs required to control policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The electorate is not too stupid or too tired to control the political system. It is merely too poor.|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A consequence of the ''Investment Theory'' is that it is not necessary to assume that the voting population is stupid or malevolent to explain why it will often vote for parties whose policies are opposed to their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ferguson suggests, the general population is far from ignorant or uninterested in the outcome of elections, and will often make considerable effort to understand the issues under discussion. Voting decisions ultimately, however, must be made on the basis of the information that is available, and if acquiring information is expensive in terms of time or money then most likely those decisions will be made on the basis of information subsidized by wealthy investors.

===The role of wealthy investors===
According to Ferguson, who credits the insight to Downs, one of the reasons that wealthy investors are able to influence politics to their advantage is that much of the politically relevant information that is so expensive for ordinary citizens to acquire comes quite naturally to businesses in the course of their daily operations. An example might include international banks whose business contacts constitute 'a first-rate foreign policy network'.

Similarly, economies of scale give businesses an advantage over ordinary voters. For example, large investors will routinely consult with lawyers, public relations advisors, lobbyists, and political consultants before acting. The cost of this advice is prohibitively expensive for most citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since investors cannot guarantee the outcome of an election or know exactly what policies a candidate will implement once in power, they must estimate the chances their investment will be successful. In some cases, this may lead to investors supporting more than one candidate, perhaps in more than one party. In other cases, it is expected that an investor will judge that one party will never accept its desired policies and so will become the 'core' of one party. Ferguson cites the support of labor-intensive industries such as textiles and steel supporting the Republican party after the New Deal as an example, owing to their labor policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Investment Theory'' recognizes the importance of financial contributions to political parties, Ferguson notes that direct cash contributions 'are probably not the most important way in which truly top business figures ("major investors") act politically'. Investors are also likely to act as sources of contacts, fundraisers, and as sources of legitimation for candidates, particularly through endorsements in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the theory does not predict that elections will be won by the party that is able to spend the most money. Instead, it suggests that while parties will likely need to attract significant resources in order to be able to mount a successful campaign, they do not necessarily need to attract the ''most'' money.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to other election theories===

The ''Investment Theory'' makes a number of novel predictions compared to other theories of party systems.

==Case Studies==

===The New Deal===
Ferguson uses the Investment Theory as the basis of an analysis of the [[New Deal]] in his 1984 paper "From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression", in which he argues that the New Deal policies became possible due to the changing nature of the American economy and the new coalitions of political investors that emerged as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression|journal=International Organization|date=1984|volume=38|issue=1|pages=41–94|url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/ferguson.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2016|doi=10.1017/s0020818300004276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson argues that in the early years of the twentieth century American politics was dominated by a coalition of labor-intensive industries including steel, coal, and textiles, who opposed labor, and protectionist industries who supported the Republican Party. These industries were also joined by finance, who largely shared the support for trade tariffs and aggressive foreign policy. This coalition first began to split after the first world war as successful capital-intensive firms such as [[Standard Oil]] and [[General Electric]] began to emerge for whom labor issues were less pressing and who favored lower tariffs to stimulate world trade and open new markets. International banks also moved away from protectionist policies, as post-war recovery required European nations to export to America and required US banks to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1984 p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

These firms went on to form the coalition that backed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies, as their dominant position in the world economy made them the primary beneficiaries of the New Deal's free trade policies. While these new multinational corporations were better able to tolerate the pro-labour policies of the New Deal, they did not necessarily support it. Instead, Ferguson credits the rise of independent industrial unionism as the result of masses of American voters for the first time in US history successfully pooling their resources to become major investors in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign Finance Reform==
Although the 'Investment Theory' is largely concerned with financial donations to political parties, Ferguson argues that the theory implies reform must look beyond campaign finance alone. While acknowledging a need for reform of campaign finance, 'if only to prevent more and more of society's resources going down a black hole', Ferguson suggests, that no matter how diligent the regulators are, wealthy investors will doubtless find new ways to corrupt the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, since the problem of money influencing politics stems from the cost of information, Ferguson argues the solution might come from finding ways for regular citizens to share these costs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since it is inefficient for individuals or even groups of individuals to cope with this problem on an individual basis, Ferguson proposes that the cost must be subsidized by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the United States (and other nations) already subsidize some of these costs, for example in providing public finance to political parties, franking mail or providing staff to politicians, this rarely takes place on a scale that actually does the public any good. Instead, this funding merely subsidizes parties that the rich control, with the effect that public money merely leverages the contributions of major investors.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, then, is to apply the 'Golden Rule' to ordinary citizens by providing enough public support to allow ordinary members of the public to run for office and have a reasonable chance of winning. This would not only allow ordinary citizens and (seemingly) heterodox opinions to be heard but would also have the effect of limiting the harm that private financing can have.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44011">The '''Japanese succession controversy''' refers to desires to change the [[Order of succession|laws of succession]] to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], which is currently limited to [[male]]s of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese Imperial Family]].

== Overview ==
Traditionally, the imperial throne was passed on under custom which resembled the rule of [[agnatic seniority]]. Theoretically, any male or female with [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] lineage to early Japanese monarchs, who descended in direct male line from the first emperor, [[Emperor Jimmu|Jimmu]], could come to hold the throne. In practice, preference was given to first-born male offspring of a preceding male monarch, followed by his brothers, sons and other males of the immediate male-line family; and ultimately followed by representatives of [[Shinnōke]] houses, in other words, male-line relatives, occasionally very distant male cousins.

Because there existed no restrictions on remarriage or [[polygyny]] in historical Japan, there existed usually many male relatives who could take over the throne. However, there are several historical instances of women holding the throne. An empress's offspring does not have claim to the throne from the said maternal lineage, so assigning a female to the throne had the convenient effect of postponing succession disputes.

On other occasions, the direct male heir was yet a toddler and unable to perform imperial rituals. In such instance, his mother, aunt or elder sister, if also held Imperial lineage through her patriline, temporarily took over the throne until the child came to puberty, which was deemed sufficient for a boy's accession.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan imported the [[Prussia]]n model of imperial succession, in which princesses were explicitly excluded from succession. More significantly, as a part of the effort to westernise and modernise Japan, the Japanese government banned polygamy, which was previously allowed to any family with noble rank (samurai or kuge), particularly if the first wife could not produce male offspring. After World War II, a further restriction was instituted. New rules meant that only the closest relatives of the then emperor Hirohito (children and descendants, siblings and their descendants) could be part of the official Imperial family, and have a claim to succession.

The current emperor, [[Akihito]], has two sons: [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] and [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]]; Prince Akishino is the father of the Emperor's only grandson, [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]]. The Emperor's brother [[Masahito, Prince Hitachi|Prince Hitachi]] has no children. The Emperor's late uncle [[Takahito, Prince Mikasa|Prince Mikasa]] has no male-line grandsons.

Controversy exists as to what extent the current rule of succession under ''[[Imperial Household Act|the Imperial Household Act of 1947]]'' should be changed. Those on the Right advocate a change, holding the Prussian-style agnatic primogeniture, but bringing back the previously excluded male relatives into the Imperial household. Liberals advocate the adoption of [[absolute primogeniture]]. Moderates advocate re-adoption of earlier, indigenous customs of succession, that is, that a female can succeed to the throne as long as she holds precedence in seniority or proximity within the patrilineal kinship. [[Kikuko, Princess Takamatsu|Princess Takamatsu]], the last surviving [[Arisugawa]]-Takamatsu and aunt to the current Emperor, advocated the traditional, customary rights of female princesses to succession, in her media interviews and articles, after the birth of [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]].

Adoption of absolute primogeniture would permit, as has happened in history, unmarried or widowed female descendants in the male line of the Imperial House to inherit the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], but would also allow something unprecedented: it would allow married princesses and princesses' children whose fathers are not descendants in the male line of the earlier emperors, to ascend the throne. This scenario could be interpreted as meaning a new dynasty would take over the Chrysanthemum Throne, since dynasties are traditionally defined patrilineally.  However, there is modern precedent for the children of a reigning queen to be considered as continuing her dynasty and not that of their father, including the Dutch [[House of Orange]].

== Historical background ==

=== Ruling Empresses in Japanese history ===

Eight women have served as ''tennō'', ''i.e.'' reigning [[Empress of Japan|empress]]es, during the recorded history of Japan on ten occasions. Two of those empresses have, after abdicating, reascended the throne under different names. The last time Japan had a reigning Empress was in 1771, when [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] abdicated in favor of her nephew, [[Emperor Go-Momozono]].

The ruling empresses have been:
* Nukatabe, [[Empress Suiko]] (推古天皇 Suiko Tennō) was the 33rd [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]] from 593 until 628, according to the traditional order of succession, and the first historically attested woman to hold this position. She was the granddaughter of [[Tashiraga of Yamato]], herself sister of the childless [[Emperor Buretsu]], transferring some legitimacy in succession to the throne of [[Yamato period|Yamato]] to her husband [[Emperor Keitai]]. Tashiraga's mother had been [[Kasuga of Yamato]], sister of the childless [[Emperor Seinei]], whose own marriage with the future [[Emperor Ninken]] had a similar effect a generation earlier.  According to legends, these ladies descended from the legendary [[Empress Jingū]], who had been ruler (since Meiji-era rewrites of history, Regent) of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] for decades at some time in the past, probably in the mid-4th century (if she really existed), and who herself descended, according to legends, from [[Amaterasu]] omikami, the Sun Goddess of the Japanese pantheon.
* Takara, [[Empress Kōgyoku]] (皇極天皇 Kōgyoku Tennō), also Empress Saimei (斉明天皇 Saimei Tennō) was the 35th and 37th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], initially from February 18, 642, to July 12, 645, ascending upon the death of her uncle [[Emperor Jomei]] (who had also been her second husband). When she abdicated, her own younger brother succeeded her. However, upon the death of the said younger brother, she reascended the throne as [[Empress Saimei]] on February 14, 655, and ruled until her death on August 24, 661. She was succeeded by her and Emperor Jomei's son, Naka no Ōe, as [[Emperor Tenji]].
* Unonosasara, [[Empress Jitō]] (持統天皇 Jitō Tennō) was the 41st imperial ruler of Japan, and ruled from 686 until 697. The previous emperor was her uncle and husband, [[Emperor Tenmu]], and she later abdicated the throne to her grandson [[Emperor Monmu]].
* Ahe, [[Empress Genmei]] (also Empress Genmyō; 元明天皇 Genmei Tennō) was the 43rd imperial ruler of Japan ruling 707–715 (died December 7, 721). She was Empress Jitō's younger half-sister and the mother of [[Emperor Monmu]], who died in an young age.
* Hitaka, [[Empress Genshō]] (元正天皇 Genshō Tennō) was the 44th monarch of Japan (715–724). She succeeded after her mother Empress Genmei and later abdicated to her nephew [[Emperor Shōmu]], son of Emperor Monmu.
* Abe, [[Empress Kōken]] (孝謙天皇 Kōken Tennō) also Empress Shōtoku (称徳天皇 Shōtoku Tennō) was the 46th imperial ruler of Japan from 749 to 758, and the 48th from 764 to 770. Her posthumous name for her second reign (764–770) was [[Empress Shōtoku]]. She never married and her ex-crown prince was [[:ja:道祖王|Prince Bunado]], her first cousin twice removed, but after her death, another of her cousins ascended the throne as [[Emperor Kanmu]], who was also her brother-in-law.
* Okiko, [[Empress Meishō]] (明正天皇 Meishō Tennō) was the 109th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], reigning from December 22, 1629, to November 14, 1643. She ascended upon the abdication of her father, being the eldest surviving child of her parents (the empress, [[Tokugawa Masako]], had only four daughters without surviving sons), holding priority over her younger half-brothers.
* Toshiko, [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 Go-Sakuramachi Tennō) was the 117th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], and ruled from September 15, 1762, to January 9, 1771. She abdicated in favor of her young nephew. Surviving over forty years, the retired Empress held all those decades the position of Dajo Tenno, and acted as sort of guardian of subsequent emperors.

=== Post Meiji-era laws ===

{{see also|Emperor of Japan#Succession}}

Women were barred from the throne for the first time in 1889 by a [[Prussia]]n-influenced constitution during the 19th century [[Meiji Restoration]]. This prohibition was continued by the [[Imperial Household Act]] of 1947, enacted under Japan's post-[[World War II]] constitution during the American occupation.  More importantly, as a part of reforming Japan, Japan introduced a ban on [[polygyny]] and the Meiji Emperor was the last to have an official secondary consort.

The 1947 law further restricts the succession to legitimate male descendants in the male line of [[Emperor Taishō]] only (excluding other male lines of the imperial dynasty, such as Fushimi, Higashikuni, Kitashirakawa, etc.), and specifically bars the emperor and other members of the imperial family from adopting children. During the recent controversy over the succession, commentators suggested that the current system could not possibly function in the long term as it is unlikely that there will always be a male heir to succeed to the throne.

[[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] and [[Masako, Crown Princess of Japan|Crown Princess Masako]] have one child, [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]], born on December 1, 2001. The child's birth, which occurred more than eight years after her parents' marriage and after the Crown Princess had considerable (and widely noted) difficulty in conceiving a child, sparked a lively debate in Japan about imperial succession.  To add to this dearth of male heirs, Crown Prince Naruhito's brother, [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]], had only two daughters, [[Princess Mako of Akishino]], born on October 23, 1991, and [[Princess Kako of Akishino]], born December 29, 1994.

The two other collateral members of the Imperial Family also had only daughters. The late [[Prince Tomohito of Mikasa]] had two daughters, [[Princess Akiko of Mikasa]], born December 20, 1981, and [[Princess Yōko of Mikasa]], born October 25, 1983. The late [[Norihito, Prince Takamado|Prince Takamado]] had three daughters, [[Princess Tsuguko of Takamado]], born March 8, 1986, [[Princess Noriko of Takamado]], born July 22, 1988, and [[Princess Ayako of Takamado]] born September 15, 1990. No male heir had been born into the Imperial Family in nearly 41 years.

In the early 2000s, the succession controversy emerged as a political issue. The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' published an editorial in May 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605050077.html | title = EDITORIAL: The emperor's status | date = 2006-05-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060506231831/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605050077.html | archivedate = 6 May 2006 | newspaper = [[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the current system was unsustainable. In an ''Asahi Shimbun'' survey in March 2006, 82% of the respondents supported the revision of the [[Imperial Household Law]] to allow a woman to ascend to the Imperial Throne.&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;女性天皇容認68%に、朝日新聞、2009年3月22日&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichirō Koizumi]] also strongly supported the revision, pledging to present a bill to the 2006 session of the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/385643/japan_koizumi_gives_up_on_female_royal_succession/ |title = Japan Koizumi gives up on female royal succession | date = February 9, 2006 | first = George | last = Nishiyama | location = Tokyo, Japan | publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative lawmakers opposed Koizumi and said the debate was premature. The current emperor's cousin, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, also opposed the proposal, saying that the official male members of the Japanese imperial family might take up concubines in order to produce male members because it was previously possible for a male illegitimate child to assume the imperial throne. Later he said that this remark was just a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/asia/20tomohito.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=A Font of Commentary Amid Japan's Taciturn Royals | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | date=October 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution would be to restore the Shinnoke (agnatic collateral branches of the imperial dynasty which had been disinherited by the United States) to the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Following the birth of Prince Hisahito, the political debate surrounding succession subsided. Koizumi withdrew his bill, though public opinion polling suggested that support for the change was still around 68%.&lt;ref name="asahi" /&gt;

==Timeline of recent events==
* On January 24, 2005, the Japanese government announced that it would consider allowing the Crown Prince and Princess to adopt a male child, in order to avoid a possible "heir crisis". [[Adoption]] from other male-line branches of the Imperial Line is an age-old imperial Japanese tradition for dynastic purposes, prohibited only in modern times by Western influence. The child would presumably be adopted from one of the former imperial branches which lost imperial status after [[World War II]].  A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on October 25, 2005, recommending that the imperial succession law be amended to permit equal primogeniture.
* In November 2005, it was reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,1627427,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bring back concubines, urges emperor's cousin | first=Justin | last=McCurry | date=November 4, 2005 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Emperor [[Akihito]]'s cousin [[Prince Tomohito of Mikasa]] had objected to the reversal of the male-only succession, in a column of the magazine of the welfare association which he serves as president. Prince Tomohito had suggested four options to continue the male-only line succession there; the fourth was permitting the Emperor or Crown Prince to take a [[concubine]], which was allowed by the former law of imperial succession.
* On January 20, 2006, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichirō Koizumi]] used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the [[Japanese Diet]] letting women ascend to the throne so that imperial succession may be continued into the future in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce any particular timing for the legislation to be introduced, nor did he provide details about its content, but said that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 government panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4630464.stm | work=BBC News | title=Japan bill to let women on throne | date=January 20, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 1, 2006, former trade minister [[Takeo Hiranuma]] caused a controversy by arguing against the proposed reform bill because Princess Aiko might marry a foreigner in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4669408.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rally against Japan royals change | date=February 1, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 6, 2006, it was announced that [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]]'s wife [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant, and would give birth due September.
* On September 6, 2006, Princess Kiko delivered a baby boy,&lt;ref name="cnn-birth"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/05/japan.princess/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211040020/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/05/japan.princess/index.html | archivedate = 11 December 2008 | publisher = CNN | title = Japan's Princess Kiko has boy | date = 6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time-birth"&gt;{{cite news | title = Japan Celebrates: It's a Boy! | first = Bryan |last = Walsh | location = Tokyo | date = 5 September 2006 | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1531895,00.html?cnn=yes | publisher = TIME World}}&lt;/ref&gt; later named [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]]. According to the current succession law he is third in line to the throne, but Princess Aiko, who now holds no right to succession, would have precedence over him as well as over her uncle if the law is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtin|first1=J.

* On January 3, 2007, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2007-01-03-japan-female-monarch_x.htm |title=Report: Japan to drop plan to allow female monarch  |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 3, 2007 |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[McLean, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |agency=The Associated Press |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2007, Abe's successor [[Yasuo Fukuda]] stated he was in favour of reforming the Imperial Household Law to allow female succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/21/asia/AS-GEN-Japan-Politics.php | title = PM candidate: government must clean up act, allow female monarch | author = The Associated Press | date = 21 September 2007 | publisher = International Herald Tribune | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611062221/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/21/asia/AS-GEN-Japan-Politics.php | archivedate = 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2009, in a speech commemorating his 20th anniversary since ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne, Emperor Akihito refrained from giving his own suggestions on the succession debate, but urged the government to consider the opinions of his sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Akishino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Sentaku Magazine |title = Royal challenge awaits Noda | newspaper = The Japan Times | year = 2012 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 5, 2011, [[Shingo Haketa]], Grand Steward of the Imperial Household Agency, visited Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] at his office and told him that it was a matter of urgency to enable female members of the imperial family to create family branches. According to the Grand Steward, the imperial family cannot maintain its activities in a stable manner. Twelve imperial family members were adults under the age of 60 but half of these were unmarried princesses between the ages of 20 and 30. As the princesses leave the family through marriage, it would become more and more difficult for the imperial family to perform its duties. Considering that Prince Hisahito was the only grandchild of Emperor Akihito eligible to assume the throne, the agency also said that it would be necessary to design a system to ensure stable succession to the imperial throne, although this would be a mid- to long-term concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20111126-312777.html | work=AsiaOne | title=Japan's Imperial family 'needs change' | last=The Yomiuri Shimbun/Asia News Network | date=November 26, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Steward Haketa has reportedly been worried about the succession issue when he took the top post at the agency in 2005. After the Democratic Party of Japan won the election in September 2009, he explained the situation to Cabinet members, urging the government to address the issue. The government has yet to act upon his request.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOCUS%3A+Imperial+succession+issue+behind+recent+talks+on+female...-a0274125295 | work=[[Kyodo News]] | title=Imperial succession issue behind recent talks on female members' status
 | date=December 3, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 25, 2011,  [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Osamu Fujimura]] said that a way had to be found to secure a "stable" accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, expressing concern over the small number of successors to the crown. "The government is aware that future anxiety over securing a stable succession has not been resolved," Fujimura said. "Maintaining a steady succession is an issue that relates to the core of the nation and the government will consider it based on thorough discussions from various levels of the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111126a4.html | work=Japan Times | title=Fujimura says 'stable' system of Imperial succession needed | first=Masami | last=Ito | date=November 26, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, former trade minister [[Takeo Hiranuma]], now a founding member of [[Sunrise Party|Sunrise Party of Japan]], contended during a meeting with conservative organizations that the male line of imperial heirs should be maintained. Hiranuma suggested that if female members were allowed to remain in the family after marrying a commoner, they should try and marry a member of the eleven branches of the imperial family that were removed from the line of succession in October 1947. Hiranuma also proposed to reinstate the former branches in the Imperial family, to increase its size.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111216f1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Imperial law revisited as family shrinks, Emperor ages | first=Alex | last=Martin | date=December 16, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 1, 2011, Prime Minister Noda called for a national debate on whether women should be allowed to retain their imperial status after marriage. He did not set any deadlines but declared his intention to build a framework to discuss the issue.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Two days later, some government officials told [[Kyodo News]] that the issue of the female members' status "does not appear to be a pressing task. The government has no energy left to spare for that." According to Kyodo, a source close to the imperial family expressed concern because of the government's hesitant attitude. "It's obvious that the imperial family's range of activities will become narrower in the future without reforming the current system. A new system needs to be created before Princess Mako gets married. I'd like to see the public take more interest in the matter," said the source.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt;
* On January 6, 2012, Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujimura told a press conference that the government recognized "that maintaining the stability of the activities of the Imperial Household and lessening the burden of official duties placed on Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress are major issues of a high degree of urgency." He announced that they would focus on discussing the status of female members and the possibility for them to create new family branches but that there would be no debate about giving succession rights to them or to their children. He announced that "in order to contribute to the discussion," expert hearings would take place once or twice every month. Former Supreme Court Justice and lawyer Itsuo Sonobe was appointed to the position of Special Advisor to the Cabinet to lead the hearings, "as he is highly knowledgeable about the Imperial Household system" and formerly served as deputy chairman of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Advisory Council on Imperial Household Law|2=ja|3=皇室典範に関する有識者会議|preserve=1}} that recommended in 2005 that the right to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne should be expanded to women and imperial family offspring of female lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/tyoukanpress/201201/6_a.html | title=Press Conference by Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujimura (Excerpt) | date=January 6, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012|quote=Advisory Council on the Imperial House Law held in 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Hiroshi|contribution=Akihito and the Problem of Succession|editor-last=Shillony|editor-first=Ben-Ami|title=The Emperors of Modern Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|format=snippet|url=//books.google.co.jp/books?id=FwztKKtQ_rAC&amp;pg=PA314|page=314|isbn=90-04-16822-2|quote=Prime Minister Koizumi Jun'ichirō in December 2004 set up a panel of experts, the ''kōshitsu tempan ni kansuru yūshikisha kaigi'' (Advisory Council on Imperial Household Law)}} {{ISBN|978-90-04-16822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 7 and 8, 2012, a Kyodo News poll showed that 65.5% of the Japanese people supported the idea of allowing female members of the imperial family to create their own branches of the family and to retain their imperial status after marriage. The telephone survey drew valid responses from 1,016 eligible voters in 1,459 households randomly dialed across Japan, apart from parts of [[Fukushima Prefecture]] evacuated by the nuclear crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120109a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Support rate for Cabinet sinks to 35.7% | last=Kyodo News | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 10, 2012, a ''[[The Japan Times|Japan Times]]'' editorial accused Fujimura of "beating around the bush" by solely talking about the importance of maintaining "the activities of the Imperial Family in a stable manner" and of lightening "the burden of the Emperor and Empress's official duties." It voiced concerns that "if male members of the Imperial Family become very few, it will become difficult to keep the Imperial line" and that "given the current situation of the Imperial Family, making a woman Imperial Family member serve as an emperor may become unavoidable," blaming the government for "shying away from discussing a possible situation in which there will be no males to succeed to the throne."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20120210a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Imperial Family talking point | last=Editorial | date=February 10, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Jones, a law professor at [[Doshisha University]] in Kyoto, warned that, without changes, there would not be a backup plan if Prince Hisahito should fail to have a son or be incapacitated in some way. "Monarchies have extended families just so that there's a source of spares," Professor Jones said. "Over time there will be no other members of the imperial family to act as proxies." According to Jones, it is necessary to also address the succession issue as soon as possible, since it may be too late to do so by the time Hisahito becomes emperor. "They can't just suddenly conjure up new imperials," he said.

On this occasion Dr. Akira Imatani, Professor of medieval Japanese history at [[Teikyo University]], and Soichiro Tawara, a journalist, gave their opinions. Both recommended that female members of the imperial family should retain their status after marriage. "Times have changed and Japan has become a society that promotes gender equality. I think refusing to allow females to maintain their status is an anachronism," Tahara told the government panel. Tahara and Imatani proposed that commoner husbands of imperial princesses be granted quasi-imperial status, which would permit them to attend official events while keeping their jobs, if even with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120301a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Keep females in Imperial clan: experts | first=Masami | last=Ito | date=March 1, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2012, the second hearing took place. Dr. Masayuki Yamauchi, professor of international affairs at the Graduate School of The [[University of Tokyo]], and Dr. Makoto Oishi, professor of constitutional law at the Graduate School of [[Kyoto University]], also expressed their endorsement of princesses establishing their own branches. Yamauchi proposed, in order to reduce the burden on the public budget, to limit the eligibility to princesses within the second degree of kinship to the emperor. (Currently that group includes the three granddaughters of Emperor Akihito, Princesses Aiko, Mako and Kako.) According to Yamauchi, at some point in the future the imperial family may consist of a single nuclear family, that of Prince Hisahito, and support by female-headed family branches might prove helpful in avoiding such isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Mainichi | title=2 more experts back princesses creating imperial family branches | last=Kyodo News | date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 10, 2012, the third hearing took place. The experts at this hearing were [[Yoshiko Sakurai]] and Professor Akira Momochi, and these two were the first to clearly oppose the idea of letting imperial women retain their royal status upon marriage. Professor Momochi teaches law at [[Nihon University]], Japan's largest university. Ms. Sakurai is a well-known journalist and social critic in Japan, especially famous for her right-wing and sometimes ultra-nationalistic stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japansociety.org.uk/2127/japan-be-a-strong-nation-nihonyo-tsuyoki-kunto-nare/ | work=The Japan Society | title=Japan Be a Strong Nation (Nihonyo Tsuyoki Kuni to Nare) by Yoshiko Sakurai (review) | first=Takahiro | last=Miyao | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no plans to give the princesses succession rights, Ms. Sakurai and Professor Momochi still have concerns that female-headed imperial family branches could eventually break the paternal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120411a3.html | work= Japan Times | title=Conservative experts slam female Imperial branches | first=Masami | last=Ito | date= April 11, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a solution to the decrease of imperial family members and the lack of eligible male heirs, they suggested revising the [[Imperial Household Law]] so that male descendants of former imperial families which renounced their royal status in 1947 be allowed to return to the imperial family as adoptees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"There were too many, so they were cut back. Now we're in the complete opposite position, why can't we take the opposite measure?" she asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2012/04/11/japanese-journalist-weighs-in-on-the-princess-problem/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Japanese Journalist Weighs in on the Princess Problem | first=Eleanor | last=Warnock | date= April 11, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background to this statement is that up until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were only four collateral branches of the imperial family, the [[shinnōke]]. In the 19th century, more houses were created from branches of the [[Fushimi-no-miya]] house, the [[ōke]]. By 1935, there were eleven collateral branches of the imperial family altogether, in addition to the families of Emperor Showa's three brothers. According to the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the government is against the idea of reinstating the former collateral branches, "saying it will be difficult to obtain public support as the descendants were born as commoners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120301006487.htm | work=Daily Yomiuri Online | title=Imperial family talks begin / Should female members retain royal status after marriage? | last=Takeshi Okimura/Katsumi Takahashi  | date= March 2, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 23, 2012, the fourth hearing took place. The experts at this hearing also backed the establishment of female branches of the imperial family. As the government plans to hear the views of "just under 20 experts," it is assumed that the hearings are halfway finished.
* On May 4, 2012, the ''Yomiuri Shimbun'' reported that the government plans to consult the ruling [[Democratic Party of Japan]] and major opposition parties on a draft for the revision of the [[Imperial Household Act]] before submitting a bill to an extraordinary Diet session in autumn or to an ordinary sitting of the legislature next year. Looking back at the hearings, one government official said, "A wider than expected range of views have been expressed," talking about the proposal to expand the number of imperial family members by allowing men of the former princely houses to return to the imperial family as adoptees. Another idea that raised attention was allowing female imperial family members to retain the title of "princess" even after leaving the imperial family by marriage, so they could still take part in the royal family's activities despite losing the formal imperial family member status. As this idea has been supported by proponents and opponents of the creation of female-headed family branches, officials said that it could be a compromise if the discussion "remains inconclusive." As there are still controversial viewpoints concerning the possibility of allowing princesses to keep their royal status after marriage, "the leadership of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda will be crucial to government reform of the system," government officials told the ''Yomiuri Shimbun''. However, although Prime Minister Noda once underlined the urgency of the matter, he has not made any public remarks on this issue for many months. This has led to skepticism among some government officials about whether the issue is a major priority for him. A senior official of the [[Imperial Household Agency]] voiced his concern, telling the ''Yomiuri Shimbun'', "When considering the near future, the system needs to change." According to the Imperial Household Law, the Empress as well as princesses are temporarily allowed to act on behalf of the emperor in state matters. That means that if female members of the imperial family were allowed to keep their royal status after marriage, they would be able to considerably alleviate the burden of the few male royals by taking over some of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20120504dy01.htm | work= Daily Yomiuri Online | title=Imperial revision draft set for autumn release | last=Yutaka Ito/Katsumi Takahashi/Takeshi Okimura | date=May 4, 2012  | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 27, 2014, [[Noriko Senge|Princess Noriko]] announced her engagement to commoner Kunimaro Senge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wedding Bells to Ring for Japanese Princess|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/05/27/wedding-bells-to-ring-for-japanese-princess/|newspaper=Wall Street Journal Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage on 5 October 2014, she left the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Princess Noriko marries son of Izumo Taisha priest, relinquishes royal status|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/05/national/princess-noriko-marries-son-of-izumo-taisha-priest-relinquishes-royal-status/|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 27, 2016, Prince Mikasa, one of the only five family members eligible to inherit the throne, died at age 100. In the previous 15 years only two children were born into the Imperial family while seven members left through death or marriage thereby reducing their number to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Prince Mikasa’s death thrusts Imperial succession into spotlight |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/29/national/imperial-succession-spotlight/ |newspaper=The Japan Times |location= Tokyo, Japan|date= October 29, 2016 |access-date= 6 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 8, 2017, the Japanese parliament passed legislation that would allow Emperor Akihito to [[Abdication | abdicate]]. If enacted the abdication would likely occur in December 2018 when he reaches age 85.  The legislation also includes a provision that asks parliament to consider allowing female royals to remain in the Imperial Family after their marriage.  The legislation however did not address female succession, nor would the provision to abdicate apply to any successive Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4812193/japan-emperor-akihito-abdicate// |title=Japan Will Allow Emperor Akihito to Step Down, the Country's First Abdication in 200 Years |last=Kilpatrick|first=Ryan|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 8, 2017|website=time.com |access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jews Relief Act 1858''', also called the Jewish Disabilities Bill, is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which removed previous barriers to Jews entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=enacted&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/contents/enacted "Jews Relief Act 1858"], as originally enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] there had been an unsuccessful attempt in 1830 to also allow Jews to sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1830/may/17/bill-for-removal-of-jewish-disabilities#S2V0024P0_18300517_HOC_59 "BILL FOR REMOVAL OF JEWISH DISABILITIES. "], HC Deb 17 May 1830 vol 24 cc784-814&lt;/ref&gt; The 1858 measure was the result of a long process which began with a bill introduced by the Whig leader [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]  following the election of [[Lionel de Rothschild]] to the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]] in 1847. Rothschild could not take the seat without taking the Christian oath. The bill was supported by the future Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] but not by his party.

In 1848, the bill was approved by the House of Commons but was twice rejected by the [[House of Lords]] as was a new bill in 1851. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852 general election]], Rothschild was again elected but the next year the bill was again defeated in the upper house. Finally, in 1858, the House of Lords agreed to a proposal to allow each house to decide its own oath.

The bill allowed "any Person professing the Jewish Religion, [to] omit the Words 'and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian{{'"}} in their oaths, but explicitly did not extend to allowing Jews to various high offices, and also stated that "it shall not be lawful for any Person professing the Jewish Religion, directly or indirectly, to advise Her Majesty ... touching or concerning ... any office or preferment in the Church of England or in the Church of Scotland."&lt;ref name=enacted /&gt;

Amendments in 1871, 1922, 1973, 1980 and 1986 removed all restrictions on Jews holding office except that they may not advise certain government officials on matters related to appointments in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews Relief Act 1858, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/introduction as amended], accessed Sept 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political philosophy]], the '''landscapes of power''' are the features of the built environment that perform political functions — including establishing the hegemony of a governing entity or an ideological creed in a particular territory and cultivating a sense of pride in place in residents of a territory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Sharon Zukin]] originated the term in her book ''Landscapes of Power: From Detroit to Disney World.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004.  119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]] is a prime example of how the organization of physical space performs some of the functions listed above — in this case, establishing the authority over a particular area. The Panopticon is a type of prison built with a circle of cells arranged around a guard tower. The occupants of these cells are visible to the guard, but the prisoners cannot see into the tower. They must consequently behave, as they would be under surveillance, or risk the possible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, Matthew G. "Space and the Structuring of Disciplinary Power: An Interpretive Review." ''Geografiska Annaler'', 79, no. 3 (1997): 171-180. JSTOR, (Nov. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] discussed the Panopticon in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison]]''

There are 4 functions of landscape of power
1. to show who owns what
2. for nation building
3. to create identity and
4. to show who is in power.
More commonplace landscapes of power might include monuments, memorials and, as Zukin argues, even cities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal plunder''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the act of appropriating, under the laws, the property of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30|quote=the State (which he often wrote as THE STATE) is a vast machine that is purposely designed to take the property of some people without their consent and to transfer it to other people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coined by [[Frédéric Bastiat]], most famously in his 1850 book [[The Law (book)|''The Law'']]. It has since become a concept in [[libertarianism|libertarian thought]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/61/3057-legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;, and has been used similarly by others, including [[Daniel Lord Smail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737280 Legal Plunder: Households and Debt Collection in Late Medieval Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is the appropriation of the assets of another person by power groups through rules of public law that violate the principle of equality and the Constitution.

Throughout history there are many examples of legal [[plunder]] as the political and economic regimes that have followed: partial legal plunder are the result of tyranny and protectionism or universal legal plunder the result of socialism or communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 15 - Partial plunder. This is the system that prevailed so long as the elective privilege was partial; a system that is resorted to, to avoid the invasion of socialism. Universal plunder. We have been threatened by this system when the elective privilege has become universal; the masses having conceived the idea of making law, on the principle of legislators who had preceded them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the thought of Frédéric Bastiat==
Frédéric Bastiat thought that the law can only implement the individual rights: personality, liberty, and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 2 - If every man has the right of defending, even by force, his person, his liberty, and his property, a number of men have the right to combine together to extend, to organize a common force to provide regularly for this defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, if the law goes against the person, liberty, property, it becomes perverse as it goes against the rights that should be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 3 - For who will dare to say that force has been given to us, not to defend our rights, but to annihilate the equal rights of our brethren? And if this be not true of every individual force, acting independently, how can it be true of the collective force, which is only the organized union of isolated forces?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For him ''The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense''.

So he prefers a government that intervenes as little as possible in the sphere of people, liberty, and property.

Every citizen is therefore responsible for his fortune or his failures.

Frédéric Bastiat to defend his idea of what should be the purpose of the law, has set a specific definition of "''legal plunder''".

First he defines "''extra-legal plunder''" "such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 13 - As to extralegal plunder, such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code, I do not think it can be adorned by the name of socialism. It is not this that systematically threatens the foundations of society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State used against the plunderer and to defend the plundered party.

Legal plunder is when the law "''takes from some persons that which belongs to them, to give to others what does not belong to them.''"

Examples of legal plunder include protectionist tariffs, redistributive taxation, crony capitalism, welfare, etc., which Bastiat terms (only two years after the publication of the Communist Manifesto, and before it was a firm political science term of art), "socialism:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, legal plunder may be exercised in an infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for organization; tariffs, protection, perquisites, gratuities, encouragements, progressive taxation, free public education, right to work, right to profit, right to wages, right to assistance, right to instruments of labor, gratuity of credit, etc., etc. And it is all these plans, taken as a whole, with what they have in common, legal plunder, that takes the name of socialism.

Now socialism, thus defined, and forming a doctrinal body, what other war would you make against it than a war of doctrine? You find this doctrine false, absurd, abominable. Refute it. This will be all the easier, the more false, absurd, and abominable it is. Above all, if you wish to be strong, begin by rooting out of your legislation every particle of socialism which may have crept into it—and this will be no light work.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State to defend the plunderer and treat the plundered party that tries to defend his property as a criminal.

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one person, emphasizing a [[merit system]] administrator [[Shen Buhai]] (c. 400 BC – c. 337 BC) may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G.

Concerned largely with administrative and sociopolitical innovation, [[Shang Yang]] (390–338 BC) was a leading reformer of his time.&lt;ref name="historical context" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S.Y. Hsieh 1995. p.83" /&gt; His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Much of Legalism was "principally the development of certain ideas" that lay behind his reforms, and it was these that helped lead to Qin's ultimate conquest of the other states of China in 221 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

Shen's most famous successor [[Han Fei]] (c. 280 – 233 BC) synthesized the thought of the other "Fa-Jia" in his [[eponym]]ous text, the ''[[Han Feizi]]''. Written around 240 BC, the ''Han Feizi'' is commonly thought of as the greatest of all Legalist texts,&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

==Historical background==
{{further information|Warring States period}}
The [[Zhou dynasty]] was divided between the masses and the hereditary noblemen. The latter were placed to obtain office and political power, owing allegiance to the local prince, who owed allegiance to the [[Son of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="K. Lee p.24"&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 p.&amp;nbsp;24. Legalist School and Legal Positivism, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty operated according to the principles of [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] and punishment. The former was applied only to aristocrats, the latter only to commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Yu-lan Fung 1948. p.&amp;nbsp;155. A Short History of Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=HZU0YKnpTH0C&amp;pg=PA155&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Zhou kings]] kept a firm personal hand on the government, depending on their personal capacities, personal relations between ruler and minister, and upon military might. The technique of centralized government being so little developed, they deputed authority to feudal lords.&lt;ref name="Herrlee G. Creel p.124"&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;124. Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Zhou kings could no longer grant new fiefs, their power began to decline, vassals began to identify with their own regions,&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Shaughnessy. China Empire and Civilization p26&lt;/ref&gt; and schismatic hostility occurred between the Chinese states. Aristocratic families became very important, by virtue of their ancestral prestige wielding great power and proving a divisive force.&lt;ref name="Herrlee G. Creel p.124"/&gt;

In the [[Spring and Autumn]] (771–476 BC) period, rulers began to directly appoint state officials to provide advice and management, leading to the decline of inherited privileges and bringing fundamental structural transformations as a result of what may be termed "social engineering from above."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Jay L. Garfield, William Edelglass 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;59 The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC&amp;pg=PA59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu, 1996 China's Legalists p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; Most Warring States period thinkers tried to accommodate a "changing with the times" paradigm, and each of the schools of thought sought to provide an answer for the attainment of sociopolitical stability.&lt;ref name="historical context"&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 1.2 Historical Context. http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism, commonly considered to be China's ruling ethos, was articulated in opposition to the establishment of legal codes, the earliest of which were inscribed on bronze vessels in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;20. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt; For the Confucians, the [[Chinese classics|Classics]] provided the preconditions for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Knoblox Xunzi 148&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Confucians tended to consider organizational details beneath both minister and ruler, leaving such matters to underlings,&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore wanted ministers to control the ruler.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.359"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;359 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA359&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned with "goodness", the Confucians became the most prominent, followed by the proto-[[Taoism|Taoists]] and the administrative thought that [[Sima Tan]] termed the Fa-Jia. But the Taoists focused on the development of inner powers,&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 p.&amp;nbsp;26. Legalist School and Legal Positivism, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.

* Huang, Ray, China A Macro History. p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; and both the Taoists and Confucians held a regressive view of history, the age being a decline from the era of the Zhou kings.&lt;ref name="Jay L. Garfield 2011, p.65"/&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:A mandarin attended by a domestic.jpg|alt=f|thumb|The key figure in the bureaucracy that ran China was the district magistrate.

He obtained the position by first doing well in the [[Imperial examination|examination for the civil service]] and then performing well in administrative positions at a lower level. He was assisted in his duties by a staff of lower level officials, some his own employees who moved with him from place to place, some permanently located in the district.

Though Han Fei espoused that his model state would increase quality of life, he did not consider this a legitimizing factor (rather, a side-effect of good order). He focused on the functioning of the state, the ruler's role as guarantor within it, and aimed in particular at making the state strong and the ruler the strongest person within it.&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei, De, Welfare.

Shen Buhai and his philosophical successor Han Fei considered the ruler to be in a situation of constant danger from his aides,&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.347"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;347 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA347&lt;/ref&gt; and the target of Han Fei's standards in particular are the scholarly bureaucracy and ambitious advisers – the Confucians.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.347"/&gt; Saying that "superior and inferior fight a hundred battles a day",&lt;ref&gt;Ross Terril 2003 p.&amp;nbsp;68. The New Chinese Empire. https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt; long sections of the ''Han Feizi'' provide example of how ministers undermined various rules, and focus on how the ruler can protect himself against treacherous ministers, emphatically emphasizing their mutually different interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]] Asian Philosophy Vol. 15, No. 2, 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;162, Han Feizi's Legalism Versus Kautilya's Arthashastra&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not exceptional, [[Sinologist]] [[Yuri Pines]] considers this selfish view of human nature to be a pillar of the Fa-Jia, and a number of chapters of the ''Book of Lord Shang'' consider men naturally evil. The Fa-Jia are therefore distinct from the Confucians (apart from their emphasis on Fa) in dismissing the possibility of reforming the elite, that being the ruler and ministers, or driving them by moral commitment. Every member of the elite pursues his own interests. Preserving and strengthening the ruler's authority against these may be considered the Fa-Jia's "singularly pronounced political commitment".&lt;ref name="chineselegalism"/&gt; On rare occasions, [[Han Fei]] lauds such qualities as benevolence and proper social norms; with due consideration for the times they were living in however, the Fa-Jia did not believe that the moral influence or virtue of the ruler was powerful enough to create order.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.6-8"&gt;Ellen Marie Chen, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;6–8, 10, 14 Reason and Nature in the Han Fei-Tzu, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Considering the power struggle between ruler and minister irreconcilable, and focusing on the prevention of evil rather than the promotion of good, the Fa-Jia largely rejected the utility of both virtue and the Confucian rule of man, insisting on impersonal norms and regulations in their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen 2016. p.&amp;nbsp;16.

Rather than aristocratic fiefs, Qin territory came under the direct control of the Qin rulers, directly appointing officials on the basis of their qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eno 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;4, The Qin Revolution and the Fall of the Qin http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Resources.html&lt;/ref&gt; With the state of Qin conquering all the Warring States and founding the "first" Chinese empire in 221 BC, the Fa-Jia had succeeded in propelling state centralization and laying the foundations of Chinese bureaucracy, establishing "efficient and effective" codes that "became the pattern for Chinese politics for the next two millennia."&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;21. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophies of the reformers fell with the Qin, but tendencies remained in the supposedly Confucian imperial government, and the [[Han Feizi]] would be studied by rulers in every dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

R. Eno of [[Indiana University]] writes that "If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC)",&lt;ref name="indiana.edu"&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Legalism.pdf R Eno, Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt; who "may be seen as the source of the notion that good government involved skilled systems design." The reforms of Guan Zhong applied levies and economic specializations at the village level instead of the aristocracy, and shifted administrative responsibility to professional bureaucrats.

The Mohists advocated a unified, utilitarian ethical and political order, posting some of its first theories and initiating philosophical debate in China. To unify moral standards, they supported a "centralized, authoritarian state led by a virtuous, benevolent sovereign managed by a hierarchical, merit-based bureaucracy".&lt;ref name="winterstanford"&gt;Fraser, Chris, "Mohism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/mohism/&lt;/ref&gt; That social order is paramount seems to be implicit, recognized by all.&lt;ref name="google145"&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;145,147. Routledge History of Chinese Philosophy Volume 3. https://books.google.com/books?id=UL1-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&lt;/ref&gt; They argued against nepotism, and, as with the later Fa "philosophers", for universal standards (or [[meritocracy]]) as represented by the centralized state, saying "If one has ability, then he is promoted. If he has no ability, then he is demoted. Promoting public justice and casting away private resentments – this is the meaning of such statements."&lt;ref&gt;Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought.

Often compared with Plato, the [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Mohists]] contained the philosophical germs of what Sima-Tan would term the "Fa-School" ("Legalists"), contributing to the political thought of contemporary reformers.&lt;ref name="winterstanford"/&gt; The Mohists and the [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] text attributed to [[Guan Zhong]] are of particular importance to understanding Fa,&lt;ref name="Paul R.

Of particular concern for the Fa-Jia and the [[Mohists]], the fourth century witnessed the emergence of discussions polarizing the concepts of self and private, commonly used in conjunction with profit and associated with fragmentation, division, partiality, and one-sidelines, with that of the state and "public", represented by the duke and referring to what is official or royal, that is, the ruler himself, associated with unity, wholeness, objectivity, and universality. The later denotes the "Universal Way".&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"&gt;Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought. pp.&amp;nbsp;6, 8, 12–13, 16, 19, 21–22, 24, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Legalism and Mohism are distinguished by this effort to obtain objectivity.&lt;ref name="google91"&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;91.

===Mohist Hermeneutics===

Mohist and Legalist thought is not based on entities, transcendentals or universals, but parts or roles ("names"),&lt;ref name="google147"&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;147. Name and Actuality in Early Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=GId_ASbEI2YC&amp;pg=PA147&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore relatable to the Confucian [[rectification of names]], which arguably originates in Mozi's development of Fa.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen p.348-349"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 pp.&amp;nbsp;348-349 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA348

Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E.. p.&amp;nbsp;265&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting the Confucian idea of parents as a moral model as particular and unreliable, the driving idea of the Mohists was the use of [[Hermeneutics]] to find objective models/standards (Fa) for ethics and politics, as was done in any practical field, to order or govern society. These were primarily practical rather than principles or rules,&lt;ref&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144. Routledge History of Chinese Philosophy Volume 3. https://books.google.com/books?id=UL1-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&lt;/ref&gt; as in the square and plumb-line.&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"&gt;Chad Hansen, University of Hong Kong. Lord Shang. http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Lord%20Shang.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohists used Fa as "objective, particularly operational or measurement-like standards for fixing the referents of names",&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen. Shen Buhai http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm#fa&lt;/ref&gt; hoping that analysis of language standards (Fa) would yield some objective way (dao) of moral reform.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt; For Mozi, if language is made objective, then language itself could serve as a source of information and argued that in any dispute of distinctions, one party must be right and one wrong.&lt;ref name="philosophy1"&gt;Chad Hansen. Philosophy of Language in Classical China. http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/lang.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

While other terms might denote mere command, in comparison to the Western concept of law, the essential characteristic of Fa is measurement.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt; Mozi considered the elucidation of different "types" or "classes" to be the basis of both cognitive thinking and sociopolitical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Zhenbin Sun 2015. p.&amp;nbsp;113.

Fa is never merely arbitrary or the ruler's desire, nor does it aim at an intellectual grasp of a definition or principle, but the practical ability to perform a task (dao) successfully, or to "do something correctly in practice" — and in particular, to be able to distinguish various kinds of things from one another. Measuring to determine whether distinctions have been drawn properly,  Fa compares something against itself, and judges whether the two are similar, just as with the use of the compass or the L-square. What matches the standard is then the particular object, and thus correct. This constituted the basic conception of Mohist's practical reasoning and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "Mohism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/mohism/

Mozi said, "Those in the world who perform tasks cannot do without models (Fa) and standards. There is no one who can accomplish their task without models and standards. Even officers serving as generals or ministers, they all have models; even the hundred artisans performing their tasks, they too all have models. The hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles with the compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with the plumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled artisans or unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The skilled are able to conform to them. The unskilled, though unable to conform to them, by following them in performing their tasks still surpass what they can do by themselves. Thus the hundred artisans in performing their tasks all have models to measure by. Now, for the greatest to order (zhi, also 'govern') the world and those the next level down to order great states without models to measure by, this is to be less discriminating than the hundred artisans."&lt;ref name="winterstanford"/&gt;

Han Fei credits [[Shang Yang]] with the practice of Fa in statecraft,&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen Chad Hansen p.349,359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"/&gt; to which Shang Yang and Han Fei intended their "legal codes" (Fa) be as "self-interpreting"(Hansen).&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"/&gt; Shang Yang's systematic application of penalties increase the tendency to see it as penal, but arguably does not change meaning from that of the Mohists. Shang Yang's innovation was not penal law. Rather, Shang Yang's idea was that penal codes should be reformed to have the same kind of objectivity, clarity and accessibility as the craft-linked instruments.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen Chad Hansen p.349,359"&gt;Chad Hansen Chad Hansen, 1992 pp.&amp;nbsp;349,359.

Applied to economy and institution, Shang Yang's Fa is total and anti-bureaucratic, calculating rank mathematically from the adherence to standards (Fa) in the performance of roles (models), namely that of soldiers and (to a lesser extent) farmers.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen Chad Hansen p.349,359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"/&gt; Han Fei shows no revolutionary insight into rules; objectively-determined "models" (Fa) or "names" (titles/roles), being measured against, replace intuitive guidance, especially that of the ruler.

Because Fa is necessary for articulating administrative terms, it is presupposed in any application of punishment, and Han Fei stressed measurement-like links between rewards and punishments and performance.

{{block quote | Now Shen Buhai spoke about the need of Shu ("Technique") and [[Shang Yang]] practices the use of Fa ("Standards"). What is called Shu is to create posts according to responsibilities, hold actual services accountable according to official titles, exercise the power over life and death, and examine into the abilities of all his ministers; these are the things that the ruler keeps in his own hand. 

Fa includes mandates and ordinances promulgated to the government offices, penalties that are definite in the mind of the people, rewards that are due to the careful observers of standards, and punishments that are inflicted upon those who violate orders. It is what the subjects and ministers take as a model. If the ruler is without Shu he will be overshadowed; if the subjects and ministers lack Fa they will be insubordinate. Thus, neither can be dispensed with: both are implements of emperors and kings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/hanfei.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.43&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;doc.lang=bilingual

==Shang Yang (390–338 BC)==
[[File:BronzePlaque-EdictOfSecondEmperor-Qin-ROM-May8-08.png|thumbnail|Small bronze plaque containing an edict from the second emperor of the Qin dynasty. 209 BC.]]
[[File:Terracotta Army Pit 1 - 10.jpg|thumbnail|''Terracotta Army'']]

Hailing from Wei, as Prime Minister of the [[State of Qin]] [[Shang Yang]] or Gongsun Yang engaged in a "comprehensive plan to eliminate the hereditary aristocracy". Drawing boundaries between private factions and the central, royal state, he took up the cause of meritocratic appointment, stating "Favoring one's relatives is tantamount to using self-interest as one's way, whereas that which is equal and just prevents selfishness from proceeding."&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8" /&gt; 

As the first of his accomplishments, historiographer [[Sima Qian]] accounts Gongsun as having divided the populace into groups of five and ten, instituting a system of mutual responsibility&lt;ref name="JOHN K. FAIRBANK 2008. p.76"&gt;Denis Twitchett and John K. Fairbank, 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;76. Cambridge History of China.&lt;/ref&gt; tying status entirely to service to the state. It rewarded office and rank for martial exploits, going to far as to organize women's militias for siege defense. The second accomplishment listed is forcing the populace to attend solely to agriculture (or women cloth production, including a possible sewing draft) and recruiting labour from other states. He abolished the old fixed landholding system ([[Fengjian]]) and direct primogeniture, making it possible for the people to buy and sell ([[usufruct]]) farmland, thereby encouraging the peasants of other states to come to Qin. The recommendation that farmers be allowed to buy office with grain was apparently only implemented much later, the first clear-cut instance in 243 BC. Infanticide was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 94.

Gongsun deliberately produced equality of conditions amongst the ruled, a tight control of the economy, and encouraged total loyalty to the state, including censorship and reward for denunciation. Law was what the sovereign commanded, and this meant absolutism, but it was an absolutism of law as impartial and impersonal. Gongsun discouraged arbitrary tyranny or terror as destroying law.&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30, 40–41.

Insisting that it be made known and applied equally to all, posting it on pillars erected in the new capital. In 350, along with the creation of the new capital, a portion of Qin was divided into thirty-one counties, each "administered by a (presumably centrally appointed) magistrate". This was a "significant move toward centralizing Ch'in administrative power" and correspondingly reduced the power of hereditary landholders.&lt;ref name="S.Y. Hsieh 1995. p.83"&gt;S.Y.

In-order to have prohibitions, it is necessary to have executioners, hence officials, and a supreme ruler. Virtuous men are replaced by qualified officials, objectively measured by Fa.

==Shen Buhai (400–c. 337 BC)==
[[File:Archaic Bronze Candle Holder. Han Thru Warring States.jpg|thumbnail|Han state bronze candle holder]]
The basic structure and operation of the traditional Chinese state was not "legalistic" as the term is commonly understood. Though persisting, pre-modern mainstream Chinese thinking never really accepted the role of law and jurisprudence or the Shang Yang wing of the Fa-Jia. The Fa-Jia's most important contribution lies in the organization and regulation of centralized, bureaucratic government. Sinologist Creel called its philosophy administrative for lack of a better term, considering it to have been founded by [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC), who likely played an "outstanding role in the creation of the traditional Chinese system of government". 

Shen was chancellor of [[Han (state)|Han]] for fifteen years (354–337 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 81,113

* Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; the legal system of Han was apparently confused, prohibiting uniform reward and punishment. It is not surprising then that no text identifies Shen Buhai with penal law. We have no basis to suppose that Shen advocated the doctrine of rewards and punishment (of [[Shang Yang]], as Han Fei did), and Han Fei criticizes him for not unifying the laws.

Adhering thereto, Shen utilized the same category of method (Fa) as others of the Fa-Jia, but emphasized its use in secrecy for purposes of investigation and personnel control, concerning himself with methods (Fa) of (impersonal bureaucratic) administration (namely methods of appointment and performance measurement) or the ruler's role in the control thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;32.

What Shen appears to have realized is that the "methods for the control of a bureaucracy" could not be mixed with the survivals of feudal government, or staffed merely by "getting together a group of 'good men{{'"}}, but rather must be men qualified in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.&amp;nbsp;86.

Compared with Shang Yang, Shen Buhai refers to the ruler in abstract terms: he is simply the head of a bureaucracy. In comparison with [[Han Fei]] though his system still required a strong ruler at the centre,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 59,60,63&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing that he trust no one minister.&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;120. China's Legalists: The Early Totalitarians: The Early Totalitarians. https://books.google.com/books?id=7YQYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT20&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, Shen Buhai's ruler had the widest possible sovereignty, was intelligent (if not a sage), had to make all crucial decisions himself,&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and had unlimited control of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.

An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&lt;/ref&gt; Shen largely recommended that rulers investigate their ministers' performance, checking his ministers' reports while remaining calm and secretive ([[Wu wei]]). The ruler promotes and demotes according to the match between 'performance' and proposal (Xing Ming).&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 5.2 Entrapped Sovereign? http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shen Buhai insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, but couldn't afford to get caught up in details and was advised to listen to no one. Listening to his courtiers might interfere with promotions, and he does not, as [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] says, have the time to do so. The way to see and hear independently is the grouping together of particulars into categories using mechanical or operational method (Fa). On the contrary the ruler's eyes and hears will make him "deaf and blind" (unable to obtain accurate information).&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.&amp;nbsp;81.

===Shu or "Technique"===
[[File:环形算盘.jpg|thumbnail|The earliest known written documentation for the Chinese abacus, the [[Suan Pan]], dates to the 2nd century BC (its original design is unknown).]]
Apart from Shang Yang's doctrine of penalties and mutual spying and denouncement among ministers, Han Fei recommends the ruler should protect himself through careful employment of doctrines that had earlier been recommended by Shen Buhai.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 5.2 Entrapped Sovereign? http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Because Fa has diverse meaning, for clarification [[Shen Buhai]]'s successors often used the term ''Shu'' (technique) for his administrative method (Fa) and other techniques (such as "Wu-wei"), and thus 20th century philosopher [[Feng Youlan]] called Shen the leader of the group [in the Legalist school] emphasizing Shu, or techniques of government.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, p.&amp;nbsp;80

Creel believed the term originally had the sense of numbers, with implicit roots in statistical or categorizing methods, using record keeping in financial management as a numerical measure of accomplishment.&lt;ref name="philosophy2"&gt;Chad Hansen, Shen Buhai http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p pp. 49-67"&gt;Mark Czikszentmihalyi p.&amp;nbsp;50.

He defines it as "that by which one regulates the world of things; the algorithms of movement and stillness." Mastery of techniques was a necessary element of sagehood.&lt;ref name="MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p 1997 pp. 49-67"/&gt;

Another example of Shu is Chuan-shu, or "political maneuvering". The concept of Ch'uan, or "weighing" figures in Legalist writings from very early times. It also figures in Confucian writings as at the heart of moral action, including in the Mencius and the Doctrine of the Mean. Weighing is contrasted with "the standard". Life and history often necessitate adjustments in human behavior, which must suit what is called for at a particular time. It always involves human judgement. A judge that has to rely on his subjective wisdom, in the form of judicious weighing, relies on Ch'uan. The Confucian [[Zhu Xi]], who was notably not a restorationist, emphasized expedients as making up for incomplete standards or methods.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P.

In Chinese Thought: An Introduction S.Y. Hsieh suggests a set of assumptions underlying the concept of (xing-ming).
* That when a large group of people are living together, it is necessary to have some form of government.
* The government has to be responsible for a wide range of things, to allow them to live together peacefully.
* The government does not consist of one person only, but a group.
* One is a leader that issues orders to other members, namely officials, and assigns responsibilities to them.
* To do this, the leader must know the exact nature of the responsibilities, as well as the capabilities of the officials.
* Responsibilities, symbolized by a title, should correspond closely with capabilities, demonstrated by performance.

{{further information|Wu wei}}

Playing a "crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity", what is termed Wu wei (or nonaction) would become the political theory of the Fa-Jia, if not becoming their general term for political strategy. The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity,&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.&amp;nbsp;198 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA198&lt;/ref&gt; and can therefore be considered his foremost technique.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames 1983. p.&amp;nbsp;51. Art of Rulership, The. https://books.google.com/books?id=OkTurZP__qAC&amp;pg=PA50&lt;/ref&gt; The "conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp" while leaving details to ministers, would have a "deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Following Shen Buhai strongly advocated by [[Han Fei]], during the Han dynasty up until the reign of [[Han Wudi]] rulers confined their activity "chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials", a plainly "Legalist" practice inherited from the [[Qin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99
* Pan Ku. trans. Homer Dubs, The History of the Former Han Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking any metaphysical connotation, Shen used the term [[Wu wei]] to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 62–63
* S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;92 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; acting through administrative method. Shen says: 
{{quote| text=The ruler is like a mirror, reflecting light, doing nothing, and yet, beauty and ugliness present themselves; (or like) a scale establishing equilibrium, doing nothing, and yet causing lightness and heaviness to discover themselves. (Administrative) method (Fa) is complete acquiescence. (Merging his) personal (concerns) with the public (weal), he does not act. He does not act, and yet as a result of his non-action (wuwei) the world brings itself to a state of complete order.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 64
* Karyn Lai 2017. p.&amp;nbsp;172. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though not a conclusive argument against proto-Taoist influence, Shen's Buhai's Taoist terms do not show evidence of explicit Taoist usage (Confucianism also uses terms like "Tao", or Wu wei), lacking any metaphysical connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Han Feizi'' has a commentary on the Tao Te Ching, but references Shen Buhai rather than Laozi for Wu wei.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bulk of both the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzhi appear to have been composed later, [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] argued that it may therefore be assumed that Shen Buhai influenced them.&lt;ref name="S.Y. Hsieh p.92"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 48, 62–63
* S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;92 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt;.

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler need do little – and must do little.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69 
* Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;66. Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Legalists [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], Shen did not consider the relationship between ruler and minister antagonistic necessarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Peerenboom 1993 p.&amp;nbsp;241. Law and Morality in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=ctWt6bvFaNAC&amp;pg=PA241&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently paraphrasing the [[Analects]], Shen Buhai's statement that those near him will feel affection, while the far will yearn for him,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 67, 81
* Creel, 1959 p.&amp;nbsp;201. The Meaning of Hsing-Ming. Studia Serica: Sinological studies dedicated to Bernhard Kalgren&lt;/ref&gt; stands in contrast to Han Fei, who considered the relationship between the ruler and ministers irreconcilable.&lt;ref name="chineselegalism"&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shen still believed that the ruler's most able ministers are his greatest danger,&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;35 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and is convinced that it is impossible to make them loyal without techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.&amp;nbsp;143 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA143&lt;/ref&gt; Creel explains: "The ruler's subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous – and therefore vulnerable – by taking any overt action."&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 66"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 66&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his dependence on his advisers. Aside from hiding the ruler's weaknesses, Shen's ruler therefore makes use of method (Fa) in secrecy. Even more than with Han Fei, Shen Buhai's ruler's strategies are a closely guarded secret, aiming for a complete independence that challenges "one of the oldest and most sacred tenets of (Confucianism)," that of respectfully receiving and following ministerial advice.&lt;ref&gt;Karyn Lai 2017. pp.&amp;nbsp;171–172, 185. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&lt;/ref&gt;

Though espousing an ultimate inactive end, the term does not appear in the ''[[Book of Lord Shang]]'', ignoring it as an idea for control of the administration.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69"/&gt;

====Yin (passive mindfulness)====
Shen's ruler plays no active role in governmental functions. He should not use his talent even if he has it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. However, [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] also argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen's ruler to "truly rule", because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 65–66

Monumenta Serica, 39, 87–114. {{JSTOR|40726902}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinologist]] [[John Makeham]] explains: "assessing words and deeds requires the ruler's dispassionate attention; (yin is) the skill or technique of making one's mind a tabula rasa, non-committaly taking note of all the details of a man's claims and then objectively comparing his achievements of the original claims."&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J.

A commentary to the Shiji cites a now-lost book as quoting Shen Buhai saying: "By employing (yin), 'passive mindfulness', in overseeing and keeping account of his vassals, accountability is deeply engraved." The Guanzi similarly says: "Yin is the way of non-action. Yin is neither to add to nor to detract from anything. To give something a name strictly on the basis of its form – this is the Method of yin."&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;90-91.

==Shen Dao (350–c. 275 BC)==
[[File:Qin Weight Iron.JPG|thumbnail|Iron weight dated from 221 BC with 41 inscriptions written in seal script about standardizing weights and measures during the 1st year of Qin dynasty
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where there is a scale, people cannot deceive others about weight; where there is a ruler, people cannot deceive others about length; and where there is Fa, people cannot deceive others about one's words and deeds.

[[File:Mold for making banliang coins.jpg|thumbnail|Mold for making banliang coins]]
[[Shen Dao]] argued for Wu wei in similar manner to Shen Buhai, saying
{{quote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks. The ministers use all their intelligence and strength to perform his job satisfactorily, in which the ruler takes no part, but merely waits for the job to be finished. As a result, every task is taken care of. The correct way of government is thus.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.&amp;nbsp;251 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson. Shen Dao: Text and Translation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shen Dao also espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as Shen Buhai, and in contrast with Shang Yang emphasizes the use of talent&lt;ref&gt;John S. Major, Constance A. Cook. 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;207. Ancient China: A History. https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT207&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are "not the product of one man's efforts". Along this same line however he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. 

Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue, eschewing Shen Buhai's administrative method in favour of a mechanical distribution ("the basis of fairness") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement. Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, also used by the [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] and [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]], to Shen, given a "dimensional" difference through Fa, social relationships ("yin") and division.&lt;ref&gt;John Knoblock 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;172.

{{block quote | If one rabbit runs through a town street, and a hundred chase it, it is because its distribution has not been determined... If the distribution has already been determined, even the basest people will no for it. The way to control All-under-Heaven and the country lies solely in determining distribution.}}

The greatest function of Fa ("the principle of objective judgement) is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian Li's supplementation of Fa and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Masayuki Sato 2003. pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135.

{{block quote | "The state has the li of high and low rank, but not a li of men of worth and those without talent. There is a li of age an youth, but not of age and cowardice. There is a li of near and distant relatives, but no li of love and hate."}}

For this reason he is said to "laugh at men of worth" and "reject sages", his order relying not on them but on the Fa.&lt;ref&gt;Benjanmin I. Schwartz 1985. p.&amp;nbsp;247. The World of Thought in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=kA0c1hl3CXUC&amp;pg=PA247&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Fa to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state,&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt; Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment,&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.202"&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.&amp;nbsp;202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy Fa, and Shen Dao's ruler therefore "does not show favoritism toward a single person."&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

{{block quote | When an enlightened ruler establishes [gong] ("duke" or "public interest"), [private] desires do not oppose the correct timing [of things], favoritism does not violate the law, nobility does not trump the rules, salary does not exceed [that which is due] one's position, a [single] officer does not occupy multiple offices, and a [single] craftsman does not take up multiple lines of work... [Such a ruler] neither overworked his heart-mind with knowledge nor exhausted himself with self-interest (si), but, rather, depended on laws and methods for settling matters of order and disorder, rewards and punishments for deciding on matters of right and wrong, and weights and balances for resolving issues of heavy or light...&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

The reason why those who apportion horses use ce-lots, and those who apportion fields use gou-lots, is not that they take ce and gou-lots to be superior to human wisdom, but that one may eliminate private interest and stop resentment by these means. Thus it is said: 'When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa).' The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony.

If the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault. Resentment arises from this."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.

A floating seed of the p'eng plant, meeting a whirlwind, may be carried a thousand li, because it rides on the power (shi) of the wind. If, in measuring an abyss, you know that it is a thousand fathoms deep, it is owing to the figures which you find by dropping a string. By depending on the power (shi) of a thing, you will reach a point, however, distant it may be, and by keeping the proper figures, you will find out the depth, however deep it may be.

Han Fei says: 
{{block quote | The reason why I discuss the power of position is for the sake of… mediocre rulers. These mediocre rulers, at best they do not reach the level of [the sages] Yao or Shun, and at worst they do not behave like [the arch-tyrants] Jie or Zhou. If they hold to the law and depend on the power of their position, there will be order; but if they abandon the power of their position and turn their backs on the law, there will be disorder. Now if one abandons the power of position, turns one's back on the law, and waits for a Yao or Shun, then when a Yao or a Shun arrives there will indeed be order, but it will only be one generation of order in a thousand generations of disorder... Nevertheless, if anyone devotes his whole discourse to the sufficiency of the doctrine of position to govern All-under-Heaven, the limits of his wisdom must be very narrow.&lt;ref name="hutton.philosophy.utah.edu"&gt;Eric L. Hutton 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;437 Han Feizi's Criticism of Confucianism and its Implications for Virtue Ethics. http://hutton.philosophy.utah.edu/HFZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Used in many areas of Chinese thought, Shih probably originated in the military field.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.&amp;nbsp;11. A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (shu) long before the ascendancy of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;92. A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Tzu]] would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, and Legalist punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei's concepts of power (shih) and tactics (shu).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.&amp;nbsp;12. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Kissinger]]'s ''On China'' says: "Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole... Strategy and statecraft become means of 'combative coexistence' with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weakness while building up one's own shi, or strategic position." Kissinger considers the "maneuvering" approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conflicts of the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger 2012 p.&amp;nbsp;31. On China&lt;/ref&gt;

Talent cannot be displayed without power.&lt;ref name="Chen p.113"&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.&amp;nbsp;113. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao says: "The flying dragon rides on the clouds and the rising serpent wanders in the mists. But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride."&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.&amp;nbsp;11.

Usually disregarded by the Fa-Jia, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; But his ideas otherwise constitute a "direct challenge" to Confucian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;B.W.

====Han Fei====
Like Shen Dao, Han Fei seems to admit that virtue or charisma can have persuasive power even in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric L. Hutton 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;442 Han Feizi's Criticism of Confucianism and its Implications for Virtue Ethics. http://hutton.philosophy.utah.edu/HFZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considers virtue instrumental, and Wu-wei, or nonaction, as it's essence.&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei, De, Welfare. Schneider, Henrique. Asian Philosophy. Aug2013, Vol. 23 Issue 3, p266,269. 15p. DOI: 10.1080/09552367.2013.807584. , Database: Academic Search Elite&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he criticizes virtue as insufficient; power should be amassed through "laws" (fa),&lt;ref&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.&amp;nbsp;205. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike Shen considers government by moral persuasion and government by power (shih) mutually incompatible.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; The ruler's authority (shih) should depend neither on his own personal qualities or cultivation, or even upon Shen Dao's position or power, but on Fa (law or checks and balances), a more vital source for his authority. Shang Yang and Han Fei's rejection of charisma (shih) as ineffective underwrite their rejection of the Confucian ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366

An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&lt;/ref&gt; Han Fei does stress that the leader has to occupy a position of substantial power before he is able to use these or command followers. Competence or moral standing do not allow command.&lt;ref name="Chen p.113"/&gt;

For Han Fei, in order to actually influence, manipulate or control others in an organization and attain organizational goals it is necessary to utilize tactics (shu), regulation (fa), and rewards and punishment – the "two handles".&lt;ref name="Chen p.114,146"&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 pp.&amp;nbsp;114,146. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Pines 2003 p.&amp;nbsp;76 Submerged by Absolute Power&lt;/ref&gt; Reward and punishment determine social positions – the right to appoint and dismiss. In line with Shih, these should never be relegated. The ruler must be the sole dispenser of honors and penalties. If these are delegated to the smallest degree, and people are appointed on the basis of reputation or worldly knowledge, then rivals will emerge and the ruler's power will fall to opinion and cliques (the ministers). Allowing him to prevent collapse by combating or resolving ministerial disagreements and ambitions, the rule's exclusive authority outweighs all over considerations, and Han Fei requires that the ruler punish disobedient ministers even if the results of their actions were successful.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;90.

==Han Fei (280–233 BC)==
Intending to abolish philosophy, [[Han Fei]] rejects moral reform or any natural basis for it, and considers philosophical disputation an attempt to replace the Confucians (obtain office). He inheres however to the tradition of Fa, considering coherent discourse essential for the functioning of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366

Public, measurement-like standards for applying names (administrative standards or job contracts) can "plausibly make it hard for clever ministers to lie, (or) for glib talkers to take people (or the ruler) in with sophistries... (They make it possible to) correct the faults of superiors, expose error, check excess, and unify standards... Laws, by themselves, cannot prevent the ruler from being fooled or deceived. The ruler needs Fa." Han Fei's arguments for "rule by law" (Fa) would not have as much persuasive power as they do if not for Fa, without which its objectives cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects Confucian Li, scholarly interpretation and opinion, worldly knowledge, and reputation: models must be measured, dissolving behaviour and disputes of distinction into practical application.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366

A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA90&lt;/ref&gt; he emphasizes standards (Fa), preventing disputes in language or knowledge, as the ruler's only protection.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.366"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366&lt;/ref&gt; Providing reward and penalty automatically, Fa strictly defines state functions through binding, general rules, removing from discussion what would otherwise only be opinion, and preventing conflicts of competencies, undue powers or profits. To this end, Han Fei's high officials focus solely on definition through calculation and the construction of objective models, judged solely by effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;91.

Possibly referring to the drafting and imposition of laws and standardized legal terms, Xing-Ming may originally have meant "punishments and names", but with the emphasis on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, 1999 p.&amp;nbsp;33, Writing and Authority in Early China. https://books.google.com/books?id=8k4xn8CyHAQC&amp;pg=PA33&lt;/ref&gt; It functions through binding declarations (Ming), like a legal contract.

Han Fei considers Xing-Ming an essential element of autocracy, saying that "In the way of assuming Oneness names are of first importance. When names are put in order, things become settled down; when they go awry, things become unfixed.”&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;114.

Monumenta Serica, 39, 87–114. {{JSTOR|40726902}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes that through this system, initially developed by Shen Buhai, uniformity of language could be developed,&lt;ref name="philosophy1"/&gt; functions could be strictly defined to prevent conflict and corruption, and objective rules (Fa) impervious to divergent interpretation could be established, judged solely by their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="google91"/&gt; By narrowing down the options to exactly one, discussions on the "right way of government" could be eliminated.

Though recommending use of [[Shen Buhai]]'s techniques, Han Fei's Xing-Ming is both considerably narrower and more specific. The functional dichotomy implied in Han Fei's mechanistic accountability is not readily implied in Shen's, and might be said to be more in line with the later thought of the Han dynasty linguist [[Xu Gan]] than that of either Shen Buhai or his teacher [[Xun Kuang]].&lt;ref&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;82.

====The "Two Handles"====
[[File:백호 조선고적도보.jpg|alt=|thumb|Mythical White Tiger. Qin Shi Huang was called the "Tiger of Qin"
{{paragraph break}}
Supposing the tiger cast aside its claws and fangs and let the dog use them, the tiger would, in turn, be subjected by the dog. [[Han Fei Zi]]]]
[[Image:First Emperor.jpg|right|thumb|A modern statue of the First Emperor and his attendants on horseback{{paragraph break}}

The two August Lords of high antiquity grasped the handles of the Way and so were established in the center. Their spirits mysteriously roamed together with all transformations and thereby pacified the four directions. [[Huainanzi]]]]

Though not entirely accurately, most Han works identify Shang Yang with penal law.&lt;ref name="Creel, What Is Taoism?, 100"&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Its discussion of bureaucratic control is simplistic, chiefly advocating punishment and reward.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; Shang Yang was largely unconcerned with the organization of the bureaucracy apart from this.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 100, 102&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these "two handles" (punishment and reward) nonetheless forms a primary premise of Han Fei's administrative theory.&lt;ref&gt;Christian von Dehsen Christian von Dehsen, Philosophers and Religious Leaders https://books.google.com/books?id=XZrbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT400&lt;/ref&gt; However, he includes it under his theory of Shu in connection with Xing-Ming.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.367"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of illustration, if the "keeper of the hat" lays a robe on the sleeping Emperor, he has to be put to death for overstepping his office, while the "keeper of the robe" has to be put to death for failing to do his duty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Eileen Tamura 1997 p.&amp;nbsp;54. China: Understanding Its Past, Volume 1. https://books.google.com/books?id=O0TQ_Puz-w8C&amp;pg=PA54&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of the "Two Handles" likens the ruler to the tiger or leopard, which "overpowers other animals by its sharp teeth and claws"(rewards and punishments). Without them he is like any other man; his existence depends upon them. To "avoid any possibility of usurpation by his ministers", power and the "handles of the law" must "not be shared or divided", concentrating them in the ruler exclusively.

In practice, this means that the ruler must be isolated from his ministers. The elevation of ministers endangers the ruler, with which he must be kept strictly apart. Punishment confirms his sovereignty; law eliminates anyone who oversteps his boundary, regardless of intention. Law "aims at abolishing the selfish element in man and the maintenance of public order", making the people responsible for their actions.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.2,4"/&gt;

Han Fei's rare appeal (among Legalists) to the use of scholars (law and method specialists) makes him comparable to the Confucians, in that sense. The ruler cannot inspect all officials himself, and must rely on the decentralized (but faithful) application of laws and methods (fa). Contrary to Shen Buhai and his own rhetoric, Han Fei insists that loyal ministers (like [[Guan Zhong]], [[Shang Yang]], and [[Wu Qi]]) exist, and upon their elevation with maximum authority. Though Fa-Jia sought to enhance the power of the ruler, this scheme effectively neutralizes him, reducing his role to the maintenance of the system of reward and punishments, determined according to impartial methods and enacted by specialists expected to protect him through their usage thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Pines 2003 pp.&amp;nbsp;77,83. Submerged by Absolute Power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Chen Qiyou 2000: 2.6.107)&lt;/ref&gt; Combining Shen Buhai's methods with Shang Yang's insurance mechanisms, Han Fei's ruler simply employs anyone offering their services.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;91. A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wu wei===
Devoting the entirety of Chapter 14, "How to Love the Ministers", to "persuading the ruler to be ruthless to his ministers", Han Fei's enlightened ruler strikes terror into his ministers by doing nothing (Wu wei). The qualities of a ruler, his "mental power, moral excellence and physical prowess" are irrelevant. He discards his private reason and morality, and shows no personal feelings. What is important is his method of government. Fa (administrative standards) require no perfection on the part of the ruler.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.2,4"&gt;Ellen Marie Chen, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;2,4, 6–9 Reason and Nature in the Han Fei-Tzu, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Han Fei's use of Wu-Wei may have been derivative of Taoism, but its Tao is qualitatively different from the Laozi's, emphasizing autocracy ("Tao does not identify with anything but itself, the ruler does not identify with the ministers") and Shu as a "practical principle of political control" more than any state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Lu 1998.

==Enlightened absolutism==
Even if the Fa-Jia were not ardent absolutists (and Han Fei believed that most rulers would be average), they would never dream of openly challenging absolutism, and its methods are presented as empowering the ruler. Han Fei's doctrine, however, challenges its absolutist premise out of its own mouth. In order for its administration to function, the ruler must act as a cog in its operation, and that alone. The operation of Fa implies non-interference not only in its application, but also in its development, determined through method.

[[Sinologist]] Xuezhi Guo contrasts the Confucian "Humane ruler" with the Legalists as "intending to create a truly 'enlightened ruler{{'"}}. He quotes [[Benjamin I. Schwartz]] as describing the features of a truly Legalist "enlightened ruler":&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Guo p.&amp;nbsp;141 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA141&lt;/ref&gt;

He must at all times be able to maintain an iron wall between his private life and public role. Concubines, friends, flatterers and charismatic saints must have no influence whatsoever on the course of policy, and he must never relax his suspicions of the motives of those who surround him."&lt;ref name="politicalleader"&gt;Xuezhi Guo p.&amp;nbsp;141, ''The Ideal Chinese Political Leader''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjanmin I.

Guided by Legalist thought, the First Qin Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] conquered and unified the [[Seven Warring States|China's warring states]] into [[Commandery (China)|thirty-six administrative provinces]], under what is commonly thought of as the first Chinese [[Tianxia|Empire]], the [[Qin dynasty]]. The Qin document "On the Way of Being an Official" proclaims the ideal of the official as a responsive conduit, transmitting the facts of his locale to the court, and its orders, without interposing his own will or ideas. It charges the official to obey his superiors, limit his desires, and to build roads to smooth the transmitting of directives from the center without modification. It praises loyalty, absence of bias, deference, and the appraisal of facts.&lt;ref name="Mark Edward Lewis p.22"&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, 1999 p.&amp;nbsp;22, Writing and Authority in Early China&lt;/ref&gt;

The intrastate [[realpolitik]] would end up devouring the philosophers themselves. Holding that if punishments were heavy and the law equally applied, neither the powerful nor the weak would be able to escape consequences, [[Shang Yang]] advocated the state's right to punish even the ruler's tutor, and ran afoul of the future King [[Huiwen of Qin]] ({{circa|lk=no|338}}–311 BC). Whereas at one point, Shang Yang had the power to exile his opponents (and, thus, eviscerate individual criticism) to border regions of the state, he was captured by a law he had introduced and died being torn into pieces by [[chariot]]s. Similarly, [[Han Fei]] would end up being poisoned by his envious former classmate [[Li Si]], who in turn would be killed (under the law he had introduced) by the aggressive and violent Second Qin Emperor that he had helped to take the thrones.

As recorded in the [[Shiji]] and [[Book of Han]], the [[Han dynasty]] took over the governmental institutions of the [[Qin dynasty]] almost unchanged,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 105&lt;/ref&gt; but in its early decades it was not a centralized state, parcelling out the country to a number of relatives, who as vassal kings who ruled with full authority.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107"/&gt; The reputation of Legalism suffered from its association with the former Qin dynasty. Sima Tan, though hailing the Fa "school" for "honouring rulers and derogating subjects, and clearly distinguishing offices so that no one can overstep [his responsibilities]", criticized the Legalist approach as "a one-time policy that could not be constantly applied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-legalism/ 1. Defining Legalism (Shiji 130: 3289–3291; for translations cf. Smith 2003: 141; Goldin 2011: 89).]&lt;/ref&gt; Though different philosophically, the pairing of figures like Shen Buhai and Shang Yang along with Han Fei became common in the early Han dynasty, Sima Tan glossing the three as Fa Jia and his son as adherents of "xing ming" ("performance and title").&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

The syncretic [[Han Dynasty]] text, the [[Huainanzi]] writes that "On behalf of the Ch'in, Lord Shang instituted the mutual guarantee laws, and the hundred surnames were resentful. On behalf of Ch'u, Wu Ch'i issued order to reduce the nobility and their emoluments, and the meritorious ministers revolted. Lord Shang, in establishing laws, and Wu Ch'i, in employing the army, were the best in the world. But Lord Shang's laws [eventually] caused the loss of Ch'in for he was perspicacious about the traces of the brush and knife, but did not know the foundation of order and disorder. Wu Ch'i, on account of the military, weakened Ch'u. He was well practiced in such military affairs as deploying formations, but did not know the balance of authority involved in court warfare."&lt;ref name="Ralph D Sawyer 1993. p.201"&gt;Ralph D Sawyer, 1993. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. Wu-Tzu p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; Usually referring to Warring States period philosophers, during the Han Fa-jia would be used for others disliked by the Confucian orthodoxy, like the otherwise Confucianistic reformers [[Guan Zhong]] and [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]],&lt;ref&gt;Rickett, Guanzi. p3 " The political writings are usually described as Legalist, but 'Realist' might make a description. For the most part they tend to present a point of view much closer to that of the realistic Confucian, Xunzi than either the highly idealistic Confucianism of Mencius or the Draconian Legalism advocated by Shang Yang"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Huang-Lao]] Taoists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/4.8-Huang-Lao-2010.pdf Huang-Lao Ideology. Indiana University, History G380  – class text readings  – Spring 20 10 – R. Eno. "When Sima Qian and other early historians discuss the intellectual trends of the early Han, they frequently refer to a school of thought known as "Huang-Lao"... As any quick survey of the texts will indicate, these documents are deeply syncretic, that is to say they draw together selected ideas from many different schools and attempt to present them in a harmonious arrangement. Among these schools, Laozi-style Daoism is clearly foremost. However, Legalism and certain militarist schools contribute a very significant portion of these ideas as well. Mohist and Confucian influences can also be detected, but their contributions are generally scattered and do not shape the overall structure of the texts."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influences (Xing-Ming)==
The [[Shiji]] records Li Si as repeatedly recommending "supervising and holding responsible", which he attributed to [[Shen Buhai]].&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 83"/&gt; A stele set up by [[Qin Shi Huang]] memorializes him as a sage that, taking charge of the government, established Xing-Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 105, 112, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Han dynasty, [[Sima Tan]]'s [[Huang–Lao|Taoist syncretism]] almost unmistakably uses the same sort of technique as Shen Buhai, saying:

{{block quote | When the congregation of ministers has assembled, the ruler lets each do as he will (zi ming). If result coincides with claim, this is known as 'upright'; if it does not, this is known as 'hollow'."&lt;ref&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;74. Name and Actuality in Early Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=GId_ASbEI2YC&amp;pg=PA74&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Huang–Lao]] text [[Huangdi Sijing|Jing fa]] says
{{block quote | The right way to understand all these (things) is to remain in a state of [vacuity,] formlessness and non-being. Only if one remains in such a state, may he thereby know that (all things) necessarily possess their forms and names as soon as they come into existence, even though they are as small as autumn down. As soon as forms and names are established, the distinction between black and white becomes manifest... there will be no way to escape from them without a trace or to hide them from regulation... [all things] will correct themselves.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.&amp;nbsp;253 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shiji states that [[Emperor Wen of Han]] was "basically fond of Xing-Ming." Jia Yi advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai's method, so as to be able to "supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government." Pressure groups saw Jia Yi's dismissal, but was brought back to criticize the government. Two advisors to Wen's heir, [[Emperor Jing of Han]] were students of Xing-Ming, one passing the highest grade of examination, and admonished Jing for not using it on the feudal lords.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87, 103, 106–107, 115

By the time of the civil service examination was put into place, Confucian influence saw outright discussion of Shen Buhai banned. Xing-Ming is not discussed by Imperial University's promoter, the famous Confucian [[Dong Zhongshu]]. However, the Emperor under which it was founded, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], was both familiar with and favorable to Legalist ideas, and the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by [[Gongsun Hong]], who did write a book on Xing-Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 86–87, 115&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] was still said by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87

===Han dynasty===
The administration and political theory developed during the formative [[Warring States period]] would still influence every dynasty thereafter, as well as the Confucian philosophy that underlay Chinese political and juridical institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1288392 |first=Paolo D. |last=Farah |title=The Influence of Confucianism on the Construction of the Chinese Political and Juridical System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the Fa-Jia on Han Confucianism is very apparent, adopting Han Fei's emphasis of a supreme ruler and authoritarian system rather than [[Mencius]]'s devaluation thereof, or [[Xun Kuang]]'s emphasis on the Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Lihsueh Lin, 1990 p.&amp;nbsp;444.

Shen Buhai's book appears to have been widely studied in the beginning of the Han era.&lt;ref name="Creel p.35"&gt;Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;35.

Creel. Shen Pu-Hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B. C. pp.&amp;nbsp;151–152&lt;/ref&gt; Jia describes Shen Buhai's Shu as a particular method of applying the Tao, or virtue, bringing together Confucian and Taoist discourses. He uses the imagery of the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzhi]] of the knife and hatchet as examples of skillful technique in both virtue and force, saying "benevolence, righteousness, kindness and generosity are the ruler's sharp knife. Power, purchase, law and regulation are his axe and hatchet".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Czikszentmihalyi p.&amp;nbsp;49, 65.

[[Emperor Wu of Han]] (140–87 BC) barred Legalist scholars from official positions and established a university for the study of the Confucian classics,{{sfnp|Creel|1953|p=159}} but his policies and his most trusted advisers were Legalist.{{sfnp|Creel|1953|pp=166–171}} [[Michael Loewe]] called the reign of Emperor Wu the "high point" of Modernist (classically justified Legalist) policies, looking back to "adapt ideas from the pre-Han period."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Csikszentmihalyi 2006 pp.&amp;nbsp;xxiv, xix Readings in Han Chinese Thought&lt;/ref&gt; An official ideology cloaking Legalist practice with Confucian rhetoric would endure throughout the imperial period, a tradition commonly described as ''wàirú nèifǎ'' ({{zh|t=外儒内法|l=outside Confucian, inside Legalist}}).{{sfnp|Fu|1996|p=8}}

It became commonplace to adapt Legalist theories to the Han state by justifying them using the classics, or combining them with the notion of the "way" or "pattern of the cosmos" ("The Way gave birth to law" [[Huangdi Sijing]]).

In 1572 [[Zhang Juzheng]], a legalistic, prime-minister like figure of the Ming Dynasty, had the young emperor of the time issue a warning edict against China's bureaucracy with the reference that they had abandoned the public interest for their own private interests. It reads: "From now on, you will be pure in your hearts and scrupulous in your work. You will not harbor private designs and deceive your sovereign...  You will not complicate debates and disconcert the government." It suggests that good government will prevail as long as top ministers were resolute in administration of the empire and minor officials were selflessly devoted to the public good. It is said that the officials became "very guarded and circumspect" following its release. His "On Equalizing Taxes and Succoring the People" postulated that the partiality of local officials toward powerful local interests was responsible for abuses in tax collection, hurting both the common people and the Ming state.&lt;ref&gt;H. Miller 2009 p.&amp;nbsp;27. State versus Gentry in Late Ming Dynasty China, 1572–1644&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Juzheng wrote that "it is not difficult to erect laws, but it is difficult to see they are enforced." His Regulation for Evaluating Achievements (kao cheng fa) assigned time limits for following government directives and made officials responsible for any lapses, enabling Zhang to monitor bureaucratic efficiency and direct a more centralized administration.

Legalism was partly rehabilitated in the twentieth century by new generations of intellectuals. One, Mai Menghua (1874–1915), promulgated interest in Shang Yang's thought, comparing Shang Yang's view of history with the evolutionary ideas of western theorists. [[Hu Shi]] (1891–1962) hailed Han Fei and Li Si for their "brave spirit of opposing those who 'do not make the present into their teacher but learn from the past{{'"}}. [[Guomindang]] leader [[Hu Hanmin]] (1879–1936) wrote the preface to a new edition of the Book of Lord Shang.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

Chinese Law: Context and Transformation: Revised and Expanded Edition https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2xyDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&lt;/ref&gt; early modern Chinese scholarship often viewed it within the context of Western "rule of law".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One 1922 article, The Antiquity of Chinese Law, attributes three legal theories to Han Fei, referred to as a "jurist".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard S Hsu, 1922 p.&amp;nbsp;165 China Review, Volume 3, https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2IpIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U3zU6bDwPuxn_hVXYDLzPiPggLukQ&amp;ci=448%2C628%2C161%2C18&amp;edge=0&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1920s on it was viewed as being in a historical struggle with the Confucian "rule of men".&lt;ref name="google15"/&gt;

The Limits of the Rule of Law in China. https://books.google.com/books?id=h_kUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&lt;/ref&gt; Rule of law again gained prominent attention in the 1970s after the [[Cultural Revolution]], in [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s platform for modernization.

Two decades of reform, Russia's collapse and a financial crisis in the 1990s only served to increase its importance, and the 1999 constitution was amended to "provide for the establishment of a socialist rule-of-law state", aimed at increasing professionalism in the justice system. Signs and flyers urged citizens to uphold the rule of law. In the following years figures like Pan Wei, a prominent Beijing political scientist, would advocate for a consultative rule of law with a redefined role for the party and limited freedoms for speech, press, assembly and association.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom 2002 pp.&amp;nbsp;ix,x,4.

Legalist discourse is seeing a resurgence during the [[Paramount leader|leadership]] of [[Xi Jinping]], who is the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], with journalists reporting on his fondness for the Chinese classics, alongside Confucianism including Legalist writers and in particular [[Han Fei]], both of which Xi sees as relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/world/leader-taps-into-chinese-classics-in-seeking-to-cement-power.html|title=Leader Taps into Chinese Classics in Seeking to Cement Power|date=12 October 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;19.

A key phrase of Xi's reforms is "govern the state according to law" (yi fa zhi guo), but focuses on enforcing discipline on party and government officials first.&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;20. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Realists===
In the Western world some early modern scholars used the term Realist, believing that said Realists, rejecting all appeals to tradition and the supernatural, held that law should replace morality.&lt;ref name="Creel,What Is Taoism?, 94"&gt;Creel,What Is Taoism?, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark Edward Lewis p.18-19"&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, 1999 pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19, Writing and Authority in Early China&lt;/ref&gt; Waley contrasts what he terms the Realists with other the schools as largely ignoring the individual, holding that the object of any society is to dominate other societies,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Waley 1982. p.&amp;nbsp;194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.F.P. Hulsewé]] writes "(Shang Yang and Han Fei) were not so interested in the contents of the laws as in their use as a political tool... the predominantly penal laws and a system of rewards were the two 'handles{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Remnants of Han Law. by A. F. P. Hulsewe. Page 7 (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Angus Charles Graham sketched the fundamentals of an "amoral science" largely on the basis of the Han Feizi, consisting of "adapting institutions to changing situations and overruling precedent where necessary; concentrating power in the hands of the ruler; and, above all, maintaining control of the factious bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism. pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15 https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Liang Zhiping]] theorized that law emerged initially in China, namely, as an instrument by which a single clan exercised control over rival clans.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Winston. Singapore Journal of Legal Studies [2005] 313–347. The Internal Morality of Chinese Legalism. http://law.nus.edu.sg/sjls/articles/SJLS-2005-313.pdf5{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier [[Spring and Autumn period]], a Qin king is recorded as having memorialized penalty as a ritual function benefiting the people, saying "I am the little son: respectfully, respectfully I obey and adhere to the shining virtuous power, brightly spread the clear punishments, gravely and reverentially perform my sacrifices to receive manifold blessings. I regulate and harmonize myriad people, gravely from early morning to evening, valorous, valorous, awesome, awesome – the myriad clans are truly disciplined! I completely shield the hundred nobles and the hereditary officers. Staunch, staunch in my civilizing and martial [power], I calm and silence those who do not come to the court [audience]. I mollify and order the hundred states to have them strictly serve the Qin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oriens-extremus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OE45-03.pdf Biases and Their Sources: Qin History in the Shiji, Yuri Pines (Jerusalem), pg 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Terrill]] writes that "Chinese Legalism is as Western as Thomas Hobbes, as modern as Hu Jintao. It speaks the universal and timeless language of law and order. The past does not matter, state power is to be maximized, politics has nothing to do with morality, intellectual endeavour is suspect, violence is indispensable, and little is to be expected from the rank and file except an appreciation of force." He calls Legalism the "iron scaffolding of the Chinese Empire", but emphasizes the marriage between Legalism and Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Terril 2003 pp.&amp;nbsp;68–69. The New Chinese Empire https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese law expert Peerenboom compares Han Fei against the accepted standards of legal positivism and concluded that he is a legal positivist. Establishing the ruler as the ultimate authority over the law, he also "shares the belief that morality and the law need not coincide."&lt;ref&gt;Lim Xiao Wei, Grace 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;8. Law and Morality in the Han Fei Zi. http://www.scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/18874/Law%20and%20Morality%20in%20the%20Han%20Fei%20Zi.pdf?sequence=1{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--DO NOT add genocides that clearly do not meet the UN criteria, ie, killing of economic or political groups, or "cultural genocides/ethnocides." Provide sources that demonstrate the genocide is recognized as such by significant mainstream scholarship under the most common definition (the legal definition) of genocide. Remember wikipedia is not a [[WP:SOAPBOX]]. For highest and lowest estimates, do not use unreliable sources or sources which give significantly different figures than mainstream research. --&gt;

This '''list of genocides by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by [[genocide]]. It does not include non strictly-genocidal mass killing (variously called [[mass murder]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[politicide]], [[policide]], [[classicide]], [[war crimes]]) such as the [[Thirty Years War]] (7.5 million deaths), [[Japanese war crimes]] (3 to 14 million deaths), the [[Red Terror]] (100,000 to 1.3 million deaths), the [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] (1 to 15 million deaths), the [[Great Purge]] (0.6 to 1.75 million death), or the [[Great Leap Forward]] (15 to 55 million deaths).

The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=https://www.un.org/ar/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf|title=Analysis Framework: Legal definition of genocide|work=Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide (OSAPG)|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other definitions can be found in scholarly literature and national law of different countries.

As R.J. Rummel writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human death toll over only 267 days was incredible. Just to give for five out of the eighteen districts some incomplete statistics published in Bangladesh newspapers or by an Inquiry Committee, the Pakistani army killed 100,000 Bengalis in Dacca, 150,000 in Khulna, 75,000 in Jessore, 95,000 in Comilla, and 100,000 in Chittagong. For eighteen districts the total is 1,247,000 killed. This was an incomplete toll, and to this day no one really knows the final toll. Some estimates of the democide [Rummel's 'death by government'] are much lower—one is of 300,000 dead—but most range from 1 million to 3 million. ... The Pakistani army and allied paramilitary groups killed about one out of every sixty-one people in Pakistan overall; one out of every twenty-five Bengalis, Hindus, and others in East Pakistan. If the rate of killing for all of Pakistan is annualized over the years the Yahya martial law regime was in power (March 1969 to December 1971), then this one regime was more lethal than that of the Soviet Union, China under the communists, or Japan under the military (even through World War II)."

Myanmar's military forces immediately launched a series of retaliatory attacks against Rohingya civilians, and were joined by local Buddhist extremists. Together they burnt down hundreds of Rohingya villages, killed thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children, tortured countless others, and sexually assaulted countless Rohingya women and girls. Several Rohingya refugees say they were forced to witness soldiers throwing their babies into burning houses to die in the fire. Numerous Rohingya refugee women and girls have provided accounts of being brutally gang raped.

&lt;!--&lt;ref name=holocaustestimates&gt;Early efforts by scholars to determine the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis were limited by a lack of access to pertinent records. The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]]]

'''Machiavellianism''' is defined as the political theory of Niccolò Machiavelli, especially the view that any means can be used if it is necessary to maintain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Machiavellianism|title=Definition of MACHIAVELLIANISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Italian Renaissance]] diplomat and writer [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], born in 1469, who wrote ''[[The Prince|Il Principe]]'' (''The Prince''), among other works.

In modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the [[dark triad]] personalities, characterized by a duplicitous interpersonal style, a cynical disregard for morality, a lack of empathy, and a focus on [[self-interest]] and personal gain.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

==Political thought==
{{Main|Niccolò Machiavelli}}
After his exile from political life in 1512, Machiavelli took to a life of writing, which led to the publishing of his most famous work, ''The Prince.'' The book would become infamous for its recommendation for rulers to be ready to act in unscrupulous ways, such as resorting to deceit and cunning, political assassination, and the usage of fear as a means of keeping order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF6X2ow__MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+foundations+of+modern+political+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiws8O47sLeAhXoYN8KHbA_AYUQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20foundations%20of%20modern%20political%20thought&amp;f=false|title=The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 1, The Renaissance|last=Skinner|first=Quentin|date=1978-11-30|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521293372|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, immediately following the publication of ''The Prince'', Machiavellianism was seen as a foreign plague infecting northern European politics, originating in Italy, and having first infected France. It was in this context that the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572 in Paris came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the [[Huguenot]] Innocent Gentillet, who published his ''Discours contre Machievel'' in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, 283 – see also the whole chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's "books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized [''sic''] courtiers" in France (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) "at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholomew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, 286&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, not that politicians telegraph their intentions in writing, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, Chapters 10 and 11; p. 328 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English playwrights [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] incorporated this view into some of their works.  Shakespeare's Gloucester, later Richard III, refers to Machiavelli in ''[[Henry VI, Part III]]'', for instance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (1589–90) "Machievel" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming not to be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, "And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends" (Prologue, lines 3–4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/901/901-h/901-h.htm Project Gutenberg ''Jew of Malta'' text]&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe's last play, ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|the Duke of Guise]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start.

The ''[[Anti-Machiavel]]'' is an 18th-century essay by [[Frederick the Great]], King of [[Prussia]] and patron of [[Voltaire]], rebutting ''The Prince'', and Machiavellianism. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king, and is one of many such works.

[[Denis Diderot]], the French philosopher, viewed Machiavellianism as "an abhorrent type of politics" and the "art of tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Diderot, Denis (ascribed by Jacques Proust).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Machiavellian intelligence}}
Machiavellianism is also a term that some [[Social psychology|social]], forensic and [[Personality psychology|personality]] psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themself from conventional morality and hence to [[deceive]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism  (sometimes referred to as the ''Machiavelli test'').&lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) "How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out." ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 15.4: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Mach&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;IV'' test, a twenty-statement personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool of Machiavellianism. People scoring high on the scale (''high Machs'') tend to endorse statements such as, "Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so," (No. 1) but not ones like, "Most people are basically good and kind" (No. 4), "There is no excuse for [[lie|lying]] to someone else," (No. 7) or "Most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives" (No. 11). Using their scale, Christie and Geis conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of "High Machs" and "Low Machs" differ.&lt;ref name=basic&gt;Christie, R. &amp; Geis, F. (1970) "Studies in Machiavellianism". NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Their basic results have been widely replicated.&lt;ref name=McIlwain&gt;McIlwain, D. 2003. Bypassing empathy: mapping a Machiavellian theory of mind and sneaky power. In Individual Differences In Theory Of Mind, eds. B. Repacholi and V. Slaughter. Macquarie Monographs in Cognitive Science. NY: Psychology Press. 39-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Measured on the ''Mach&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;IV'' scale, males are, on average, slightly more Machiavellian than females.&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=instrument&gt;Gunnthorsdottir, A., McCabe, K. &amp; Smith, V. 2002 "Using the Machiavellianism instrument to predict trustworthiness in a bargaining game". Journal of Economic Psychology 23, 49-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
A 1992 review described Machiavellian motivation as related to cold [[selfishness]] and pure instrumentality, and those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives (e.g. sex, achievement, sociality) in duplicitous ways. More recent research on the motivations of high Machs compared to low Machs found that they gave high priority to money, [[Power (social and political)|power]], and competition and relatively low priority to community building, self-love, and family concerns. High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

===Abilities===
Due to their skill at interpersonal manipulation, there has often been an assumption that high Machs possess superior intelligence, or ability to understand other people in social situations. However, research has firmly established that Machiavellianism is unrelated to [[IQ]]. Furthermore, studies on [[emotional intelligence]] have found that high Machiavellianism actually tends to be associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both performance and questionnaire measures. Both [[empathy|emotional empathy]] and emotion recognition have been shown to have negative correlations with Machiavellianism. Additionally, research has shown that Machiavellianism is unrelated to a more advanced [[theory of mind]], that is, the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social situations. If high Machs actually are skilled at manipulating others, this appears to be unrelated to any special cognitive abilities as such.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

=== Relations with other personality traits ===
Machiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the [[dark triad]], along with [[narcissism]] and [[psychopathy]]. Some psychologists consider Machiavellianism to be essentially a subclinical form of psychopathy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Intelligence|last=Goleman |first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Goleman|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research suggests that while Machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap, they are distinct personality constructs.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Psychopathy differs from Machiavellianism in impulsivity and a lack of self control.&lt;ref name=Dark_Triad&gt;Paulhus, D. L. &amp; Williams, K. M. 2002. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Delroy_Paulhus/publication/222828329_The_Dark_Triad_of_Personality_Narcissism_Machiavellianism_and_Psychopathy/links/59d735c6a6fdcc52acae2c10/The-Dark-Triad-of-Personality-Narcissism-Machiavellianism-and-Psychopathy.pdf The Dark Triad of personality: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy]". Journal of Research in Personality 36 (2002) 556–563.&lt;/ref&gt;Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with [[Agreeableness]] (''r'' = −0.47) and [[Conscientiousness]] (''r'' = −0.34), two dimensions of the [[Big five personality traits|Big Five]] personality model (NEO-PI-R).&lt;ref name=Dark_Triad/&gt; However, Machiavellianism correlates more highly with the [[Honesty-humility]] dimension of the six-factor [[HEXACO model]] than with any of the Big Five dimensions.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Individual Differences in Social Behavior|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York/London|isbn=978-1-59385-647-2|pages=257–273|author=Jones, Daniel N.|author2=Paulhus, Delroy L.|editor=Leary, Mark R. |editor2=Hoyle, Rick H|chapter=Chapter 7.  Machiavellianism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Machiavellianism has also been located within the [[interpersonal circumplex]], which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and communion. Agency refers to motivation to succeed and to individuate the self, whereas communion refers to motivation to merge with others and to support group interests. Machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the circumplex defined by high agency and low communion.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally opposite from a circumplex construct called ''self-construal'', a tendency to prefer communion over agency. This suggests that people high in Machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve, they wish to do so at the expense of (or at least without regard to) others.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

===Game theory===

In 2002, the Machiavellianism scale of Christie and Geis was applied by behavioral [[game theory|game theorists]] Anna Gunnthorsdottir, [[Kevin McCabe (economist)|Kevin McCabe]] and [[Vernon L. Smith]]&lt;ref name="instrument"/&gt; in their search for explanations for the spread of observed behavior in experimental games, in particular individual choices which do not correspond to assumptions of material self-interest captured by the standard [[Nash equilibrium]] prediction. It was found that in a [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow [[homo economicus]]' equilibrium strategies while those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium, and instead made choices that reflected widely accepted moral standards and [[social preferences]].

===Dimensionality===

Although there have been myriad proposed factor structures, two dimensions emerge most consistently within factor-analytic research - differentiating Machiavellian views from tactics.&lt;ref name="Fehr, Samsom, and Paulhus, 1992"&gt;Fehr, B.; Samsom, D.; and Paulhus, D. L., 1992. The Construct of Machiavellianism: Twenty Years Later. In C. D. Spielberger &amp; J. N. Butcher (Eds), Advances in Personality Assessment (Vol 9), pp. 77–116. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Mach-IV scale is unable to reliably capture the two dimensions, a 10-item subset of the scale known as the Two-Dimensional Mach-IV (TDM-V), reproduces the views and tactics dimensions across countries, genders, sample types, and scale category length.&lt;ref name="Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M., 2016"&gt;Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M. (2016). The role of Machiavellian views and tactics in psychopathology. Personality and Individual Differences, 94, 72–81.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M. (2018)"&gt;Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M. (2018). Nomological Network of Two-Dimensional Machiavellianism. Personality and Individual Differences, 130, 161–173. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.03.047.&lt;/ref&gt; The views dimension appears to capture the neurotic, narcissistic, pessimistic, and distrustful aspects of Machiavellianism, while the tactics component captures the more unconscientious, self-serving, and deceitful behavioural aspects (phenotypically similar to psychopathy). Although no research has so far identified the causal direction of the two-dimensions, it is likely that the views generate and validate the use of Machiavellian tactics.

==In the workplace==
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
Machiavellianism in the [[workplace]] is the employment of cunning and duplicity in a business setting. It is an increasingly studied phenomenon. The root of the concept of Machiavellianism is the book ''The Prince'' by Machiavelli which lays out advice to rulers how to govern their subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[leadership]], and morally bankrupt tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically only manipulates on occasions where it is necessary to achieve the required objectives.&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;Kessler, SR; Bandeiii, AC; Spector, PE; Borman, WC; Nelson, CE; and Penney, LM 2010. Reexamining Machiavelli: A three dimensional model of Machiavellianism in the workplace. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 40, 1868–1896&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies Machiavellianism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;
* maintaining [[Power (social and political)|power]]
* harsh management tactics
* manipulative behaviors

The presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with [[counterproductive workplace behaviour]] and [[workplace deviance]].&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

The '''National Schism''' ({{lang-el|Εθνικός Διχασμός}}, ''Ethnikos Dikhasmos'', sometimes called '''The Great Division''') was a series of disagreements between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] regarding the foreign policy of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] in the period of 1910–1922 of which the tipping point was whether Greece should enter [[World War I]]. Venizelos was in support of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and wanted Greece to join the war on their side, while the pro-[[German Empire|German]] King wanted Greece to remain neutral, which would favor the plans of the [[Central Powers]].

The disagreement had wider implications, since it would also affect the character and role of the king in the state. The dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two and in subsequent events their followers divided into two radically opposed political camps affecting the wider Greek society.

With the contrary actions of Venizelos permitting the landing of Allied forces in [[Thessaloniki]] and the unconditional surrender of a military fort in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to German-Bulgarian forces by the king, the disagreements of the two men started to take the form of [[civil war]]. In August 1916, followers of Venizelos set up a provisional state in Northern Greece, with Entente support, with the aim of reclaiming the lost regions in Macedonia, effectively splitting Greece into two entities. After intense diplomatic negotiations and [[Noemvriana|an armed confrontation]] in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces the king abdicated on 11 June 1917, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place.

Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially [[Greece in World War I|joined the war]] on the side of the Allies, emerging victorious and securing new territory by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The bitter effects of this division were the main features of Greek political life until the 1940s, and contributed to Greece's defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], the collapse of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] and the establishment of the dictatorial [[Metaxas Regime]].

==Source of the conflict==
{{Details |Goudi coup}}

The main cause of the conflict was the dispute between Venizelos and King Constantine over power in Greece, in which the development of true representation had been slow since the creation of the state. Up till the 1870s and the King's acceptance of the principle that the leader of the [[majority party]] in Parliament should be given the mandate to form a government, the formation of political groupings around a leader who could govern if this pleased the King meant that the supposedly [[parliamentary government]] was actually at the monarch's discretion.{{Sfn | Koliopoulos | 2002 | p = 53}}

Many reformists and liberals viewed meddling by the monarchy in politics as deleterious. The negative public attitude towards the monarchy was strengthened by the defeat of the Greek army, headed by Constantine (then the [[Crown Prince]]), in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Many of these hopes for reform were also shared by young officers in the [[Hellenic Army]], who felt humiliated by the defeat, and who were influenced by [[republicanism]].

A "[[Military League]]" was formed, and on 15 August 1909, they issued a [[pronunciamiento]] at the Goudi barracks in Athens. The movement, which demanded reforms in government and military affairs, was widely supported by the public; [[King George I of Greece|King George]] was forced to give in to the military's demands. He appointed [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]] as Prime Minister and accepted the dismissal of the Princes from the military.

However, it soon became apparent that the leadership of the League was not able to govern the country, and they looked for an experienced political leader, who would also preferably be anti-monarchist and not tainted by the "old-partyism" of the old system. The officers found such a man in the person of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], a prominent [[Crete|Cretan]] politician, whose clashes with [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]], the island's [[regent]], seemed to confirm his anti-monarchist and republican credentials.

With Venizelos' arrival, the League was sidelined, and the energetic and relatively young politician soon dominated Greek political life. His government carried out a large number of overdue reforms, including the creation of a revised [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitution]]. However, he also established a close relationship with the King, resisted calls to transform the revisionary assembly into a constitutional one, and even reinstated the Princes in their positions in the army, with Crown Prince Constantine as its Inspector-General.

===Balkan Wars (1912–13)===
{{Further |Balkan Wars|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}
With the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]], Constantine was immediately appointed again as [[commander-in-chief]], and the successes of the army in the field, especially in the [[Second Balkan War]] against the [[Bulgaria]]ns, helped many forget his record in 1897. Constantine, now king, was being hailed as "laurel-crowned" and "Bulgar-slayer". It was however during this war that the first tension between Constantine and Venizelos surfaced, in a dispute over the army's course following the victory at [[Battle of Sarantaporo|Sarantaporo]]. Constantine wanted to march due north, towards [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]], while Venizelos was anxious that the army should turn east, towards the strategically important city and harbor of [[Thessaloniki]].

The anxiety of Venizelos was doubled by the fact that the Bulgarians had also set their eyes on the city, the most important in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and were sending their own troops towards it. Eventually Venizelos prevailed, and the Greeks captured the city only a few hours before the arrival of the Bulgarians. This episode was not publicised at the time, and in the aftermath of the Wars, the two men, King and Prime Minister, both wildly popular, were seen as making up a formidable partnership at the helm of the Greek state.

==Beginning of the conflict==
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|right|thumb|180px|King Constantine I in German Field Marshal's uniform. He judged that Greece's interests were best served by remaining neutral in the First World War.]]

As the [[World War I|Great War]] began, the Greek authorities had to choose between [[Neutral country|neutrality]] and aligning themselves with the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]]. Outright participation in the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]] was not an option, both because of Greece's vulnerability to the [[Royal Navy]] and because, from early on (October 1914), Greece's traditional enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], had joined in on Germany's side. Hence, neutrality was the course favored by most pro-German Greeks, including the senior, German-educated, leadership of the General Staff, who had great influence over the King.

King Constantine's German affiliations were exaggerated in the Entente's propaganda during the war. It is true that [[Sophia of Prussia|Queen Sofia]] was the sister of the German [[Kaiser]], [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and Constantine himself had been educated in Germany and admired German culture. On the other hand he was descended on his father's side from the Glucksbergs of Denmark and on his mother's side from the Romanovs of Russia, spoke perfect English, was a frequent visitor to England and had relatives there. 

Greece had an ongoing mutual defense pact with [[Serbia]], a member of the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]], who were asking for support after they were invaded by [[Austria-Hungary]] (see [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]]).
However, Constantine believed it was in the greater interests of Greece to remain neutral. His considerable military experience and knowledge made him especially conscious of the threat to Greece from Bulgaria's powerful military in the event that the Hellenic Army was engaged in a war with Austria-Hungary. The Prime Minister, Venizelos, was strongly in favor of joining the Entente, as he believed that Greece would gain new lands and fulfill the [[Megali Idea]].

In January 1915, in an attempt to convince the Greeks to side with them, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] offered Greece post-war concessions in [[Asia Minor]] (currently part of Turkey). Venizelos felt this was very much in Greece's interests and attempted to force a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] through the Greek parliament to join the Allies. He also adivsed King Constantine to convene the [[Crown Council of Greece|Crown Council]], which he did. It met twice, on [[Crown Council of Greece meeting of 18 February 1915|February 18]] and on [[Crown Council of Greece meeing of 20 February 1915|February 20]]. In these meetings, Venizelos presented his case for joining the Entente, a course of action which was opposed by opposition leader Theotokis, but Rallis supported. Staunch opposition by the King, Army generals (including the General Staff and [[Ioannis Metaxas]]) and their supporters, forced Venizelos to resign shortly afterwards (on March, 6).

==The clash and schism of Greece==

[[File:Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος.jpg|thumb|left|Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Prime Minister, believed that Greece's interests were best served by entering the war on the side of the Allies.]]
The resignation caused political dissension in Greece, a diplomatic battle between the King and Venizelos' supporters forced a [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|general election in June 1915]]. These elections were won by Venizelos' [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] and he resumed his post as Prime Minister, however Constantine refused to ratify the appointment of the new government until August.

During this time the [[Serbia]]n-[[Bulgaria]]n conflict deepened until Bulgaria declared war on Serbia, which posed an immediate threat to the newly gained province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], including the strategically important port of [[Thessaloniki]].
Venizelos asked Constantine for permission to formalize a defense treaty with Serbia in the interests of protecting the Greek border from direct Bulgarian attack. Constantine agreed but only on the condition that Greece was actually attacked. After his inability to sway Constantine to act against Bulgaria, Venizelos took a new route by allowing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and French troops to land in Thessaloniki, Macedonia in aid of Serbia, after their failed operation at [[Gallipoli]]. This caused disarray in the Greek government and Venizelos took advantage of this by forcing through a parliamentary motion (with a 37-vote margin) to declare war on Bulgaria.

The invitation to the Allies by Venizelos enraged the King. The dispute between the Greek Prime Minister and the King reached its height shortly after and the King invoked the Greek [[constitution]]al right that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government. In December 1915 Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling a [[Greek legislative election, December 1915|new election]]. Venizelos left [[Athens]] and moved back to his native [[Crete]].

The Liberals boycotted this second election, which undermined the new [[Monarchism|Royalist]] government's position, as it was seen as a government directly appointed by the King, disregarding popular opinion. The tension between the two parties grew gradually over the course of the following year with both sides taking a more radical and divisive approach to the situation. Public opinion was not nearly as clearly divided during this period. When French and British forces landed in [[Thessaloniki]] (as invited by Venizelos earlier) against Constantine's wishes the Greek people supported the King's view that the Allies had violated the country's sovereignty. However, later on, when the [[Central Powers]] took control of eastern Macedonia in May 1916, the public took similar outrage at the King's inability to defend Greek territory.

[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|French troops in Athens, with the Acropolis in the background, after the ''Noemvriana''.]]

August 30, 1916, saw a [[coup]] against the Royalist government by ''[[Movement of National Defence|Ethniki Amyna]]'' (Εθνική Άμυνα, ''National Defence''), a secret pro-Venizelist military organization based in Thessaloniki. The coup succeeded to the extent that a second provisional government of Greece was formed by the group in Thessaloniki. With the backing of the Entente, Venizelos returned to the Greek mainland from [[Crete]] to lead the new provisional government at the head of a [[triumvirate]]. He declared: "we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians". Towards the end of 1916 France and Britain, after failing to persuade the royalist government to enter the war too, officially recognized the ''Ethniki Amyna'' government as the lawful government of Greece.

In retaliation against ''Ethniki Amyna'' a royalist [[paramilitary]] unit called the "Reservists" (Επίστρατοι) was formed. Led by Colonel [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (one of Constantine's closest aides and a future dictator of Greece) the group targeted Venizelist people in [[Athens]] and nearby areas, culminating in the ''[[Noemvriana]]'', the "November events", which were ignited by an armed confrontation between Greek reservists and French marines.

Ιn retaliation, the Venizelos National Defence Government and the Entente instituted a naval blockade, seized the royalist fleet and demanded the partial disarmament of the royalist forces and their withdrawal to the [[Peloponnese]]. 

The monarchists blamed Venizelos for having the idea of the blockade. It lasted 106 days in total, during which time no goods were allowed to enter or leave royalist-controlled ports that were under the control of the Athens government. This was to set a precedent for much of the future conflict in Greece.

The Venizelist-Entente blockade eventually succeeded in its aim. In June 1917, after threats to bombard Athens if the King remained, Constantine left Greece leaving the Crown to his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]]. Venizelos took control of the government and pledged Greek support to the Entente. In July the country officially declared war on the Central Powers. During the remaining 18 months of the war 10 divisions of the Greek army fought alongside the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]] against Bulgarian and German forces in Macedonia and Bulgaria. During the conflict Greek forces participated in many victorious battles losing approximately 5,000 troops.

The act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post-World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the [[World War I|First World War]] as politically illegitimate and treasonous.

This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the [[Asia Minor Disaster]] and resulted in continued political and military unrest in the interwar years during the troubled [[Second Hellenic Republic]]. The National Schism was also one of the principal causes that led to the collapse of the Republic and the institution of the dictatorial [[4th of August Regime]] in 1936.

The division between Royalists and Venizelists even came to the United States and elsewhere with the Greek immigrants of that generation: immigrants favouring the two political camps would settle in nearby but carefully separated communities in American cities, often centred on competing Greek Orthodox parishes. In some cases, the animosity and mistrust between such parishes has survived into the 21st century, long after the original political disagreement was forgotten.

'''''Pochvennichestvo''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|tʃ|v|ɛ|n|ɪ|tʃ|ɛ|s|t|v|oʊ}}; {{lang-rus|Почвенничество|p=ˈpot͡ɕvʲɪnnʲɪt͡ɕɪstvə}}, roughly "return to the soil", from [[wikt:почва#Russian|почва]] "soil") was a late 19th-century [[Russia]]n movement tied in closely with its contemporary ideology, the [[Slavophile]] movement. 

==History==
Both the Slavophiles and the ''pochvennichestvo'' movement were for the complete [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|emancipation]] of [[serfdom]], stressed a strong desire to return to the idealized past of Russia's history and opposed [[Europeanization]]. The movement also chose a complete rejection of the [[nihilist movement|nihilist]], [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements of the time. Their primary focus was to change Russian [[society]] by the humbling of the self and social reform through the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] rather than the radical implementations of the [[intelligentsia]]. 

The major differences between the Slavophiles and the movement were that the former detested the Westernization policies of [[Peter the Great]], but the latter praised what were seen as the benefits of the notorious ruler but maintained a strong [[patriotic]] mentality for the [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]. Another major difference was that many of the movement's leaders and supporters adopted a militantly [[anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]], [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] stance.

The concept had its roots in the works of the [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who focused primarily on emphasizing the differences among people and regional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfDOcmJisn0C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Pochvennichestvo+herder&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Pochvennichestvo%20herder&amp;f=false The Dostoevsky Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lbMYxaFTMZAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Pochvennichestvo+herder&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Pochvennichestvo%20herder&amp;f=false Dostoevsky the Thinker]''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it rejected the [[universalism (disambiguation)|universalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period. The most prominent{{Says who|date=October 2015}} Russian intellectuals who founded the ideology were [[Nikolay Strakhov]], [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]].

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] also held such views, as he expressed in his novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The ideology was later adopted by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 4 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s speech at [[Columbia University]] in 2007.]]A '''political argument''' is an instance of a [[logical argument]] applied to [[politics]]. Political arguments are used by [[academia|academics]], media [[pundit (politics)|pundits]], candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously [[fallacy|fallacious]].

A classic example of political arguments are those contained in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' arguing in favor of ratification of the [[American constitution]].

There are several ways of classifying political argument:

* Based on the purpose of the argument.
* Based on the logical structure of the argument.
* Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.

== Purpose of political argument ==

The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief. Political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda.  One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that [[propaganda]] will take the place of argument.  In a [[democracy]], though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power.  In this case, political argument is an important element of [[political strategy]]. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda.

This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of [[social choice]]. Consider a social decision [[model (abstract)|model]] of the kind used in the [[theory of social choice]] (such as used in stating [[Arrow's theorem]]).  In this model society has a set of individuals ''X'' and it faces a set (political) alternatives ''A'' which need to be ranked in some way.  A ''ranking'' is a [[binary relation|relation]] ''R'' between the elements of ''A'' which is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. Note that two alternatives ''a'', ''b'' can satisfy ''a R b'' and ''b R a''. If this is the case, we say ''R'' is indifferent to ''a'', ''b''.  Each individual ''x'' in ''X'' will have an idiosyncratic ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of the alternatives in ''A''. A ''profile'' is any function ''P'' that associate to each individual ''x'' a ranking of alternatives ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;; a profile is thus a function from ''X'' to rankings of ''A''. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt; for the whole society from any profile ''P''. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function ''P'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an ''effective'' political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. ''Effective'' political argument is a concept distinct from ''valid'' political argument.

=== Example ===
{{POV check|date=December 2008}}
Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point ''T'', that is individuals with income in excess of ''T'' pay taxes, everyone else pays no taxes.   In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate ''T'' can be determined: the [[median]] income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change individual's ''voting by their pocket book'' by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, that is raising the tax cutoff point.

A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.

== Structure of political argument ==

Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion etc.   An argument cannot start from purely logical principles.  An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions.  The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of  argument (which  we can consider rules of fairness).

Semantically, one should note that some of the  premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument, are associated to specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable.  For example, arguments concerning  war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in  a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

A '''political organization''' is any [[organization]] that involves itself in the [[politics|political]] process, including [[political parties]], [[non-governmental organizations]], [[advocacy groups]] and [[special interest groups]]. Political organizations are those engaged in political activities (e.g., [[lobbying]], [[community organizing]], [[campaign advertising]], etc.) aimed at achieving clearly-defined political goals, which typically benefit the interests of their members.

While parties are one type of political organisation that may engage in some or all of those activities, they are distinct in that they typically focus on supporting [[candidates]] for public office, winning [[elections]] and controlling [[government]].

==Political parties==
{{Party politics}}

The most well-known type of political organization is the [[political party]]. Political parties are directly involved in the political processes of countries with party systems, of which there are several types.

Some of the most common types are [[democracy|democratic multi-party systems]], [[totalitarianism|single party dictatorships]], and  [[two party system]]s.

===Democratic systems===

In democratic multi-party systems such as India, Pakistan, etc., there is no restriction on the number of parties allowed to be in operation at any given time. Under these types of systems, people are free to participate in the political process both through elections and by forming their own political parties as they please.

Examples of multi-party systems are:
* {{flag|Bangladesh}}
* {{flag|Canada}}
* {{flag|France}}
* {{flag|Germany}}
* {{flag|India}}
* {{flag|Italy}}
* {{flag|Pakistan}}
* {{flag|South Africa}}
* {{flag|Taiwan}}

===Single party systems===
In single-party systems, one political party exercises control over the government. Unlike under other systems, single-party systems do not necessarily extend democratic privileges to the citizens. This means that citizens have little say regarding political subjects.

Examples of single-party systems are:
* {{flag|China}}
* {{flag|Cuba}}
* {{flag|Laos}}
* {{flag|North Korea}}
* {{flag|Vietnam}}

===Two-party systems===

Two-party systems are similar to multiparty systems in that power is not concentrated in one party and that parties have to consider the opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections. However, two-party systems restrict the people's democratic rights by not authorizing the citizen's to found their own political parties.

Most two-party systems are technically multiparty systems but all power is effectively concentrated amongst two parties or coalitions.

Examples of two-party systems are:
* {{flag|United States}}
* {{flag|Nepal}}

==Party coalitions==

Another type of political organization is the party coalition. A party coalition is a group of political parties operating together in [[parliament]]. Oftentimes, party coalitions are formed after elections have taken place and no party has clearly won a majority seat in parliament (e.g. the [[Government of Delhi|AAP-Congress Government]] in [[Delhi]]). Other coalitions are formed prior to elections and are effectively agreements between two or more parties to run jointly in elections and to pursue similar agendas (e.g. the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] in India, and the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]] in Australia).

==Labour unions==
{{labour}}

A labor union (or trade union) is a political organization formed to promote the interests of workers.

Labour unions have various roles in modern politics, including:
* Organising [[strike action]]s and [[general strike]]s
* Negotiating with employers on behalf of workers
* Ensuring that workers aren't fired without severance pay
* Assuring that workers receive reasonable salaries

Unlike other political organizations, labor unions do not directly participate in elections, although they may campaign for parties and politicians supporting their positions. Labour unionization is a way for workers to maintain unity and preserve their rights. Often, major corporations antagonize the principle of labor unionization since it results in heavier employment regulations which restrict the powers of big business to fire workers at will, effectively causing economic difficulties for such companies.

'''Post-Zionism''' refers to the opinions of some [[Israelis]], [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] [[Jews]] and others, particularly in academia, that [[Zionism]] has fulfilled its ideological mission with the creation of the modern [[State of Israel]] in 1948, and that Zionist ideology should therefore be considered at an end. The term is also used by [[Jewish right|right-wing Jews]] to refer to the [[Israeli Left|left wing of Israeli politics]] in light of the [[Oslo Accords]].

Some critics associate post-Zionism with [[anti-Zionism]], which is strenuously denied by proponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.734630] {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic of the perceptions of post-Zionism==
Post-Zionism is a term associated with a variety of perceptions and different positions, behind which stands criticism of the core beliefs of Zionist groups. Post-Zionists raise many questions about Zionism and the state of Israel, among them:
* Is the state of Israel indeed a safe shelter for the Jewish nation? Are there any other places in the world in which the Jews' conditions are better from a historical point of view? (For example, [[North America]])
* Is it really possible to have both a Jewish state and a [[democracy]]? Should Israel become a state of all its citizens?
* Is the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] entirely [[Black-and-white dualism|black-and-white]]? Did Israel always maximize its efforts to obtain peace? Should all the blame for the continuation of the conflict fall on the Arab side?

Many of the aforementioned questions have also been raised by Zionists.{{who|November 2010|date=November 2010}} However, the post-Zionists emphasize these points in their conception of Zionist history.

==In sociological development==
Transformations that took place in Israeli society in the 1980s and 1990s brought considerable changes to its values and political views. These changes have taken place in the economic field—e.g., liberalization of the Israeli economy and its opening to the global market, as well as in the breaking of the cultural [[hegemony]] of the labor movement, which existed up to that time. The prominent turning point occurred in 1977, when the right-wing [[Likud]] party first won [[parliamentary majority]]. This alone was a manifestation of the strengthening of the more extreme Zionist positions.

Several changes occurred in this period in tandem, including a reaction to the strengthening of the Zionist component in the government. Still, not all of the numerous changes occurring in tandem are due to one factor, and they are not all attributable to the phenomenon called post-Zionism.

The transformations in Israeli society accompanying the phenomenon of post-Zionism are found in a number of fields:

;Economic characteristics: Just as there are no economic characteristics unique to Zionism, which encompasses the full range of economical ideologies from [[Marxism]], [[Communism]], and [[Syndicalism]] to [[Capitalism]], there are no economic characteristics unique to post-Zionism, which encompasses extreme left-wing components as well as components that maintain a capitalist ideology. The capitalist political view of the [[free market]] and the nurturing of [[individualism]] was acceptable to great parts of the Zionist movement in Israel and outside Israel, and it is not only attributable to the post-Zionist movement. Even in the strongly socialist [[Histadrut]] during the [[Yishuv]], there existed a non-socialist liberal party. Post-Zionist parties that retain capitalist objectives and political views have continued to undermine the socialist political views that typified the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] agenda, which had a central place in the Zionist movement. The loss of the institutional collective and its historical foundations can be seen in the writings of a considerable part of the "new" sociologists and historians, who exhibit the most radical manifestation of this idea. The position of these communities is expressed in the [[individualism]] that sees individual material success as the only economic objective of the person, and also in [[economic globalization]], which supports the opening of the Israeli economic system to the world economic system, in contrast with conserving a closed and planned national economy.

;Cultural characteristics: These years are characterized by the challenging of the existence of a [[cultural hegemony]] in Israel. Different groups undermined the perception of the [[melting pot]], according to which only one Israeli culture existed and all the cultures joining it had to shed their previous identities; different communities began fighting to keep their unique cultural identities. Examples include [[Mizrahi Jews]], immigrants from the former [[USSR]], [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] and more.

;Political characteristics: Mainly after the [[Oslo Accords]], a new movement started amongst a large section of left-wing Israelis who believe that the state of Israel should no longer declare itself to be a Jewish democratic state and should rather focus on its democratic aspects. This movement seeks to create [[social equality]] in Israel.

However, the groups in Israeli society going through those processes are not necessarily post-Zionist. Actually, only a minor percentage of those groups define themselves as such.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
The above three fields do not necessarily overlap. [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], for example, might have much in common with several post-Zionists in his economic beliefs, though he is more Zionist in all other aspects.

==As an intellectual movement==
Modern post-Zionism is closely associated with the [[New Historians]], a school of [[historical revisionism]] examining the history of Israel and Zionism in the light of declassified government documents, aiming to uncover events hitherto downplayed or suppressed by Zionist historians, especially those pertaining to the dispossession of the [[Palestinians]], which the New Historians argue was central to the creation of the state of Israel.

The new post-Zionists are [[intellectual]]s, mainly [[academic]] people who consider themselves, or are considered by others, as post-Zionists. Critics of post-Zionism known as [[Neo-Zionism|neo-Zionists]] argue that it undermines the Zionist narrative in its competition with other narratives, mainly the Palestinian one.

Although there are several intellectuals considering themselves to be post-Zionists, many others are not willing to adopt this epithet. The designation of post-Zionist has been used in a derogatory manner to describe those whose opinions take them outside the Zionist movement. Therefore, there are few intellectuals who are willing to refer to themselves as such.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the early 1990s there began to appear articles by Israeli academicians who referred to themselves as post-Zionists; this was mostly in the aftermath of a lengthy public discussion on the issues surrounding the events of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|War of Independence]], attributed to the [[New Historians]]. The public mood in the aftermath of the [[Oslo Accords]], which presumed that the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] was nearing a conclusion, contributed even more to the development of this tendency. Since the start of the [[Second Intifada]], public mood has changed tremendously, and as many perceive,{{who|November 2010|date=November 2010}} the post-Zionist tendency has been in retreat.

On the other hand, post-Zionist historians were accused of adopting the Palestinian narrative without any doubts and of demonizing and delegitimizing Israel and Zionism.

In contrast to political Zionism's goal of the [[Jewish state]], many post-Zionists advocate the evolution of Israel into a non-ideological, secular, [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] state, to be officially neither Jewish nor [[Arab]] in character.

==Criticism==
Post-Zionism has been criticized by [[Shlomo Avineri]] as a polite recasting of [[anti-Zionism]], and therefore a deceptive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post-Zionism doesn't exist |author=Shlomo Avineri |date=2007-07-06 |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/878936.html |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some right-wing Israelis have accused Jewish post-Zionists of being [[self-hating Jew]]s.&lt;ref name=strenger&gt;{{Cite news

'''Regulatory capture''' is a form of [[government failure]] which occurs when a [[regulatory agency]], created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [[interest group]]s that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Regulatory Capture Definition | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | publisher = Investopedia  | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When regulatory capture occurs, the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

For [[public choice theory|public choice theorists]], regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl"&gt;Timothy B.

Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory capture refers to the actions by [[interest group]]s when this imbalance of focused resources devoted to a particular policy outcome is successful at "capturing" influence with the staff or commission members of the regulatory agency, so that the preferred policy outcomes of the special interest groups are implemented.

Regulatory capture theory is a core focus of the branch of public choice referred to as the [[Regulatory economics|economics of regulation]]; economists in this specialty are critical of conceptualizations of governmental regulatory intervention as being motivated to protect [[public good]]. Often cited articles include Bernstein (1955), Huntington (1952), Laffont &amp; Tirole (1991), and Levine &amp; Forrence (1990). The theory of regulatory capture is associated with [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[George Stigler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Regulatory Capture 101: Impressionable journalists finally meet George Stigler | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509  |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of its main developers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Amann (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=akSneB10pJ0C&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Regulating Development: Evidence from Africa and Latin America''] Google Books.

Likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, [http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf "Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083041/http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that a regulatory agency should be protected from outside influence as much as possible. Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government. However, increased transparency of the agency may mitigate the effects of capture. Recent evidence suggests that, even in mature democracies with high levels of transparency and media freedom, more extensive and complex regulatory environments are associated with higher levels of corruption (including regulatory capture).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with federalism ===
There is substantial academic literature suggesting that smaller government units are easier for small, concentrated industries to capture than large ones. For example, a group of states or provinces with a large timber industry might have their legislature and/or their delegation to the national legislature captured by lumber companies. These states or provinces then becomes the voice of the industry, even to the point of blocking national policies that would be preferred by the majority across the whole [[federation]]. Moore and Giovinazzo (2012) call this "distortion gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440445_The_Distortion_Gap_Policymaking_under_Federalism_and_Interest_Group_Capture|title=The Distortion Gap: Policymaking under Federalism and Interest Group Capture|first1=Ryan|last1=T.

The opposite scenario is possible with very large industries, however. Very large and powerful industries (e.g. energy, banking, [[Military–industrial complex|weapon system construction]]) can capture national governments, and then use that power to block policies at the federal, state or provincial level that the voters may want,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Economic rationale===
The idea of regulatory capture has an obvious economic basis, in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers,&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl" /&gt; each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, this invariably features current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with contacts in the industry. Capture is also facilitated in situations where consumers or taxpayers have a poor understanding of underlying issues and businesses enjoy a knowledge advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmr.berkeley.edu/search/articleDetail.aspx?article=5779|title=Thin Political Markets: The Soft Underbelly of Capitalism|website=cmr.berkeley.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as Jon Hanson and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media, academia and popular culture, thus they will try to capture them as well. This phenomenon is called "deep capture".&lt;ref&gt;Jon D. Hanson and David G. Yosifon, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=938005 ''The Situation: An Introduction to the Situational Character, Critical Realism, Power Economics, and Deep Capture''] Abstract at [[Social Science Research Network]].

Retrieved April 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory public interest is based on market failure and welfare economics. It holds that regulation is the response of the government to public needs. Its purpose is to make up for market failures, improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and maximize social welfare. Posner pointed out that the [[public interest theory]] contains the assumption that the market is fragile, and that if left unchecked, it will tend to be unfair and inefficient, and government regulation is a costless and effective way to meet the needs of social justice and efficiency. Mimik believes that government regulation is a public administration policy that focuses on private behavior. It is a rule drawn from the public interest. Irving and Brouhingan saw regulation as a way of obeying public needs and weakening the risk of market operations. It also expressed the view that regulation reflects the public interest.

== Development ==
The review of the United States' regulation of history at the end of the 19th century, especially the regulation of railway tariffs by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, revealed that regulations and market failures are not relevant. At least until the 1960s, in terms of regulatory experience, regulation was developed in the direction of favoring producers, and regulation increased the profits of manufacturers within the industry. In potentially competitive industries such as the trucking industry and the taxi industry, regulations allow pricing to be higher than cost and prevent entrants.In the natural monopoly industries such as the electric power industry, there are facts that regulation has little effect on prices, so the industry can earn profits above normal profits. Empirical evidence proves that regulation is beneficial to producers.

These empirical observations have led to the emergence and development of regulatory capture theory. Contrary to regulatory public interest theory, regulation capture theory holds that the provision of regulation is adapting to the industry's need for regulation, that is, the legislator is controlled and captured by the industry in regulation, and the regulation institution is gradually controlled by the industry. That is, the regulator is captured by the industry.The basic view of the regulatory capture theory is that no matter how the regulatory scheme is designed, the regulation of an industry by a regulatory agency is actually "captured" by the industry. The implication is that regulation increases the profits of the industry rather than social welfare.

The above-mentioned regulatory capture theory is essentially a purely capture theory in the early days, that is, the regulators and legislators were captured and controlled by the industry. The later regulatory models such as Stiegler (Stigler Model)-Pelzmann (Pelzmann Model)-Becker (Becker Model) belong to the regulatory capture theory in the eyes of Posner (1974) and others. Because these models all reflect that regulators and legislators are not pursuing the maximization of public interests, but the maximization of private interests, that is, using "private interest" theory to explain the origin and purpose of regulation. Aton (1986) argues that Stigler's theoretical logic is clear and more central than the previous "capture theory" hypothesis, but it is difficult to distinguish between the two.

Regulatory capture theory has a specific meaning, that is, an experience statement that regulations are beneficial for producers in real life. In fact, it is essentially not a true regulatory theory. Although the analysis results are similar to the Stigler model provide interpretation and support for the regulatory capture theory is beneficial for producers, however the analysis methods of the latter are completely different. Stigler used standard economic analysis methods to analyze the regulation behavior, then created a new regulatory theory - regulatory economic theory. Of course, different divisions depend on the criteria for division, and they essentially depend on the researchers' different understanding of specific concepts.

== Types ==
There are two basic types of regulatory capture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobinproject.org/sites/tobinproject.org/files/assets/Kwak%20-%20Cultural%20Capture%20and%20the%20Financial%20Crisis.pdf |title=Preventing Regulatory Capture |first1=Daniel |last1=Carpenter |first2=David A. |last2=Moss |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corralling Capture |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/370256/doc/slspublic/corrralling_caputure.pdf |first=David Freeman |last=Engstrom |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Materialist capture''', also called ''financial capture'', in which the captured regulator's motive is based on its material self-interest. This can result from bribery, [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving doors]], political donations, or the regulator's desire to maintain its government funding. These forms of capture often amount to [[political corruption]].
* '''Non-materialist capture''', also called ''cognitive capture'' or ''cultural capture'', in which the regulator begins to think like the regulated industry. This can result from interest-group lobbying by the industry.
Another distinction can be made between capture retained by big firms and by small firms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadin|first=Sharon|date=2015|title=Too Small to Fail: State Bailouts and Capture by Industry Underdogs|url=http://law.capital.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=35862|journal=43 Capital University Law Review 889|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stigler mainly referred, in his work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|date=1971|title=The Theory of Economic Regulation|url=|journal=2 BELL J.

The creation of the ICC was the result of widespread and longstanding anti-railroad agitation. [[Richard Olney]] joined the [[Grover Cleveland]] administration as [[attorney general]] not long after the ICC was established. Olney, formerly a prominent railroad lawyer, was asked if he could do something to get rid of the ICC.&lt;ref name="wsj-frank"&gt;[[Thomas Frank]], [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124580461065744913 "Obama and 'Regulatory Capture'"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (June 24, 2010). Retrieved April 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He replied,

{{quote|The Commission… is, or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of the railroads, at the same time that supervision is almost entirely nominal. Further, the older such a commission gets to be, the more inclined it will be found to take the business and railroad view of things.… The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it.&lt;ref name="wsj-frank" /&gt;}}

While the [[Interstate Commerce Act]] forbade "undue and unreasonable prejudice" against interstate passengers, in the sixty-six years before [[Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company]] (1955) the ICC had ruled against every black petitioner bringing a [[racial segregation]] complaint, earning the nickname "The Supreme Court of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Making History in a Segregated Washington: By Dovey Johnson Roundtree and her 45 year Fight for Justice|author=Katie McCabe|url=http://www.badc.org/files/journal/JBADC2011.pdf|page=84|publisher=Journal of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia|date={{date|May 15, 2011}}

====Nuclear Regulatory Commission====
According to [[Frank N. von Hippel]], despite the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) has often been too timid in ensuring that America's 104 commercial reactors are operated safely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nuclear power is a textbook example of the problem of "regulatory capture"—in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=frank%20von%20hippel&amp;st=cse |title=It Could Happen Here |author=Frank Von Hippel |date=March 23, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then-candidate [[Barack Obama]] said in 2007 that the five-member NRC had become "captive of the industries that it regulates" and Joe Biden indicated he had absolutely no confidence in the agency.&lt;ref name="salon-je"&gt;Justin Elliott, [https://archive.is/20130104144649/http://www.salon.com/news/japan_earthquake/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/03/17/jeff_merrifield_nuclear_energy_institute "Ex-regulator flacking for pro-nuke lobby"] Salon.com (March 17, 2011).

Although the exception, there have been instances of a [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]. Jeffrey Merrifield, who was on the NRC from 1997 to 2008 and was appointed by presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]], left the NRC to take an executive position at [[The Shaw Group]],&lt;ref name="mothrjns" /&gt; which has a nuclear division regulated by the NRC.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Pete Domenici]], a former [[U.S. senator]] now promotes nuclear energy. Over the course of his 20 years in government, he received $1.25 million in political contributions connected with the energy sector. From 2000 to 2010, the nuclear industry and people who work in it, contributed $4.6 million to members of Congress, in addition to the $54 million spent by electric utilities, trade groups and other supporters to hire lobbyists, including some former members of Congress.

A year-long [[Associated Press]] (AP) investigation showed that the NRC, working with the industry, has relaxed regulations so that aging reactors can remain in operation.&lt;ref name="ap-jdonn"&gt;Jeff Donn, [http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2011/06/20/us_aging_nukes_part_1/index.html "U.S. nuclear regulators weaken safety rules"] Salon.com (June 20, 2011).

However, a paper by Stanford University economics professors John B. Taylor and Frank A. Wolak compared the financial services and nuclear industries. While acknowledging both are susceptible in principle to regulatory capture, they concluded regulatory failure – including through regulatory capture – has been much more of a problem in the financial industry and even suggested the financial industry create an analog to the [[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]] to reduce regulatory risk.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Drell-Shultz_NuclearEnterprise_ch13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Santer Commission''' was the [[European Commission]] in office between 23 January 1995 and 15 March 1999. The administration was led by [[Jacques Santer]] (former [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]]).

The body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign ''en masse'' due to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under [[Manuel Marín]] until the [[Prodi Commission]] was appointed.

==Appointment==
In 1994 [[Jacques Delors]] was due to step down from a successful tenure as [[President of the European Commission]]. However his federalist style was not to the liking of many national governments. Hence when the proposal of [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] (the then-[[Prime Minister of Belgium]]) was presented, he was vetoed by the UK on the grounds he was too federalist. [[Jacques Santer]], then-[[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]], was seen as less federalist as his [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] had earlier proposed the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar structure]]. Hence he was nominated and approved by the [[European Council]] on 15 July 1994.&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;{{cite web | title =The crisis of the Santer Commission  | publisher =CVCE (Centre for European Studies) | url =http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_crisis_of_the_santer_commission-en-7380f95b-1fb2-484d-a262-d870a0d5d74d.html | accessdate = 2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence he was seen as being the "second choice" which weakened his position, with the [[European Parliament]] approving him only by a narrow majority.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt; Santer himself admitted that he "was not the first choice – but to become Commission president was not my first choice either."&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meade|first=Geoff|title=Euroville|journal=E!Sharp magazine|pages=63|date=January–February 2008|publisher = Encompass Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did however flex his powers over the nominations for the other [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]. The President gained this power under the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that came into force the previous year. On 18 January 1995 he got his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected) and they were appointed by the Council on 23 January.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

==Early work==
The Santer Commission oversaw the development of the [[Treaty of Nice]] before it was signed in 2000, negotiations with those [[Enlargement of the European Union|countries to join]] in 2004 and the signing of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Discover the former Presidents: The Santer Commission | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]] | url =http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/santer/index_en.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably it contributed to the development of the euro and issued a series of [[green paper]]s based on Commissioner [[Yves-Thibault de Silguy]]'s work. The Commission also developed the [[Euro sign|euro currency symbol]]. The euro was established on 1999-01-01. The Commission also continued Delors' social agenda, pushed for more powers in that field including tackling unemployment and began proposals for the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

Santer, desiring a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim would be "to do less, but do it better" (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a [[sound bite]], it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if the nature of the Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy.&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"/&gt; However, during 1998 the Commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

==Budget controversy==
The [[Budget of the European Union|community's budget]] for each year needs to be discharged by the Parliament following its report by the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's [[Committee on Budgetary Control]] initially refused to discharge the [[Budget of the European Union|community's budget]] for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman  | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | pages=106–7 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul van Buitenen]], a [[whistle-blower]] working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: ''"I found strong indications that . . . auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations . . . The commission is a closed culture and they want to keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."'' In response, the Commission suspended him on half pay for releasing details of an inquiry.&lt;ref name="Buitenen"&gt;{{cite web | title=EU chief: No fraud cover-up  | publisher =[[BBC News]]| date=7 January 1999  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/250052.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul van Buitenen |title=Blowing the Whistle: Fraud in the European Commission |publisher=Politicos Pub |year=2000 |isbn=9781902301464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PaulineGreenatEP.jpg|thumb|left|[[Party of European Socialists|PES]] leader [[Pauline Green]] tabled a vote of no confidence in the Commission]] --&gt;
However it eventually supported the discharge 14 to 13 on 11 December, recommending that the plenary support the discharge. It was taken to plenary for debate four days later however the assigned rapporteur publicly went against the Committee's official position and urged the plenary to reject the discharge motion. President Santer announced that the Commission would treat the vote of discharge as [[vote of confidence|one of confidence]]. In a vote on 17 December 1998, the Parliament denied the discharge.&lt;ref name="Ringe"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher =[[University of Pittsburgh]]  |date=February 2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on the basis it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, [[Pauline Green]], announced she would put forward a [[motion of censure]]. However PES would vote against its own motion, as there is no method for a motion of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/historic_moments/newsid_8207000/8207105.stm BBC Democracy Live: 14 January 1999: Crisis in the EU]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a ''de facto'' opposition party to the executive.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; This is in part because the allegations centred on [[Édith Cresson]] and [[Manuel Marín]], both from the [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist party]] (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the [[European People's Party|People's party]] (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the [[European Parliament election, 1999|1999 elections]]. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

==Resignation==
Following negotiations, including national capitals pressuring their MEPs,&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; the Parliament met to vote on the resolutions on 14 January 1999. It accepted the PES resolution and turned down a censure motion 293 to 232. Hence the ''Committee of Independent Experts'' was set up with its members appointed by the political leaders in Parliament and the Commission to create a balance.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; A number of high-profile figures&lt;ref&gt;André Middelhoek (chair) [[Inga-Britt Ahlenius]], Juan Antonio Carillo Salcedo, Pierre Lelong and [[Walter van Gerven]]&lt;/ref&gt; were appointed and President Santer agreed to "respond" to its findings.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; The report was produced on 15 March 1999 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that "It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility."&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

[[Image:Santer Commission.jpg|thumb|The entire Santer Commission resigned in response to the report]]
In response to the report, PES withdrew their support from the Commission&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; and joined the other groups stating that unless the Commission resigned of its own accord, it would be forced to do so.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt; So, on the night of 15 March, Santer announced the mass resignation of his Commission.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; The morning following the resignation, against the recommendation of his advisors, Santer attacked the conclusions of Committee.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt; The report was seen to be even in criticising not only PES members but also the workings of the Commission itself. It also exposed the situation that neither Parliament, nor the President, could force the resignation of individual Commissioners as they could only be 'recalled' by national governments. Paris refused to recall Cresson,&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; who refused to resign of her own accord, which sparked the need for a mass resignation. Commissioner [[Mario Monti]] criticised this stating that "This Commission has collectively resigned, I believe, not because of collective responsibility but because certain members of it preferred not to take their own individual responsibilities."&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web | last =Harding | first =Gareth | title =Unfolding drama of the Commission's demise | date =18 March 1999 | publisher =[[European Voice]] | url =http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=8627 | accessdate =2007-10-07 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Édith Cresson went before the [[European Court of Justice]] and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension.&lt;ref name="Cresson"&gt;{{cite web | title=Court rules against ex-French PM  | publisher =[[BBC News]]  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5167940.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-07  | date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer, who went on to serve time as an MEP and never fully recovered, and the rest of his Commission.&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"/&gt;

==Repercussions==
The immediate effect was that the politically weakened Commission was unable to react to the beginning of the [[Kosovo War]] and the close of the [[Agenda 2000]] negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.&lt;ref name="Topan"&gt;{{cite web | last = Topan | first = Angelina | title= The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation'  | publisher = European Integration online Papers | date = 30 September 2002 | url = http://eiop.or.at/eiop/texte/2002-014.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped by the leaders in Parliament that such a political challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming 'dramatic'. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with [[soundbite]]s. Further more it also drew greater attention from the Council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in to agree on a new president, it was clear that the candidate had to be acceptable to parliament.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed, it can be seen that the government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the Commission.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

The [[Prodi Commission]], which succeeded Marín's caretaker administration, announced a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. Following pressure from Parliament, the Commission quickly established [[OLAF]], an anti-fraud office which replaced the Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Protection (UCLAF) established in 1988&lt;ref name="OLAF"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Budget Fraud |publisher=politics.co.uk |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/europe/eu-budget/eu-budget-fraud/eu-budget-fraud-$366701.htm |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211092606/http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/europe/eu-budget/eu-budget-fraud/eu-budget-fraud-$366701.htm |archivedate=11 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seen as having failed in its duty.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt; OLAF was established with more powers and to be more independent, especially in terms of investigation where they are formally autonomous from the Commission.&lt;ref name="OLAF"/&gt; There were a few members who survived the Santer Commission to continue under Prodi: [[Franz Fischler]], [[Erkki Liikanen]], [[Mario Monti]] and [[Neil Kinnock]]. The latter was appointed to undertake institutional reform.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

The reappointment of some of these members showed that individual Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would have never been able to have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.&lt;ref name="Topan"/&gt;

The Commission college had 20 members (two for the largest five member states, one each for the remainder) and included Commissioners from new member states Sweden, Finland and Austria. Had Norway not rejected EU membership in 1995, their Commissioner would have been [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] who was proposed as [[European Commissioner for Fisheries &amp; Maritime Affairs|Commissioner for Fisheries]];&lt;ref name="Composition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Division of portfolios in the new Commission | date = 29 October 1994 | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]] | url =http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/94/1002&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skirt and blouse voting can be seen as a form of protest against particular presidential or legislative candidates that are imposed upon voters by party elites or as a vote of no confidence in particular candidates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain experts also attribute the phenomenon to the increasing political consciousness of the nation's electorate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.graphic.com.gh/news/politics/skirt-and-blouse-voting-in-ghana-the-trend-winners-and-losers.html|title=Ghana news: ‘Skirt and blouse’ voting in Ghana.

The phenomenon of skirt and blouse voting has grown in recent years, with 11 constituencies voting skirt and blouse in 1996 compared to 26 constituencies voting skirt and blouse in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/11/14/constituencies-that-voted-skirt-and-blouse-in-2012-infographic/|title=Constituencies that voted skirt and blouse in 2012 [Infographic]|last=Tsikata|first=Mawuli|date=2016-11-14|website=Ghana News|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, none of the 28 constituencies that voted skirt and blouse in [[Ghanaian general election, 2016|2016]] were duplicates from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Skirt-and-blouse-voting-in-Ghana-the-trend-winners-and-losers-496016|title='Skirt and blouse’ voting in Ghana: the trend, winners and losers|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ribbon International''' is a United Nations Non-Governmental Organization that created a large decorated cloth promoting [[nuclear disarmament]] and care and protection of the earth. In an event held on August 4, 1985, panels were connected in an {{convert|18|mi|km}} long strip stretching from [[the Pentagon]] into Washington D.C. The event was covered in the film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'' by [[Nigel Noble]] (1988). Individual sections of the Ribbon are exhibited internationally. In 1991, The Ribbon International became a United Nations Non Governmental Organization.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon International"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Ribbon International | work = UN NGO Directory | publisher = United Nations

Ribbons were used at peace demonstrations at the [[Nevada Nuclear Test Site]], and the Horse Creek Missile Silo near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1986.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=264}}

[[File:Justines Ribbon.jpg|thumb|Merritt's first Ribbon panel is embroidered with the names of people she loved.]]

The Ribbon International was created in 1982 as a [[Anti-nuclear protests|protest against nuclear war]] by Justine Merritt (1924–2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Merritt | first = Justine | title = Sowing Seeds | url = http://justinemerritt.net/ | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a trip to the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, in 1975, Merritt conceived the idea of wrapping [[the Pentagon]] with a mile of ribbon to recall (in Merritt's words) "that we love the earth and its people," which is analogous with tying a string around one's finger to remember something.&lt;ref name="Grogan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grogan | first = David | title = A Pentagon Ribbon for Peace | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091229,00.html | journal = People Magazine | date = July 8, 1985 | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=80}} The event took place on August 4, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingson | first = Jennifer A. | title = Ring Around the Pentagon: A Nuclear Frieze | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1985/2/8/ring-around-the-pentagon-a-nuclear/ | journal = The Harvard Crimson | date = February 8, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pentagon Ceremony Aug. 4 Peace Ribbons in Oklahoma Called In | url = http://newsok.com/pentagon-ceremony-aug.-4-peace-ribbons-in-oklahoma-called-in/article/2115461 | journal = The Oklahoman: NewsOK| date = July 20, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kampel | first = Stewart | title = A 'Ribbon' For Peace Unfurled On L.I. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/a-ribbon-for-peace-unfurled-on-li.html | journal = New York Times | date = March 3, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 40th anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=1}}

[[File:Justine Merritt.jpg|thumb|left|Justine Merritt founded the project.]]

The Ribbon was made in the three years leading up to the Pentagon event from hundreds of panels created by local groups co-ordinated nationally by Mary Frances Jaster of Denver with state co-ordinators. Each {{convert|36|by|18|in|cm}} panel used embroidery, quilting, painting and other techniques.  The makers were invited to convey their thoughts and emotions in the panels, with their story on the back.

Friends, relatives, places of worship, and other organizations helped spread Merritt's idea throughout the United States and around the world. Local newsletters and arts and crafts magazines such as ''Fibre Art'', ''Handwoven'', and ''Quilter's Newsletter Magazine'' helped publicize the project.&lt;ref name= "Wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilcox | first = Don | title = Peace Ribbon Wraps Washington In Largest Collaborative Craft Event In American History | journal = The Craft Report | date = October 1985 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = Fibre Artist Hopes to Wrap Pentagon in Long Embroidered Ribbon That Transforms Ugly Fear Into Concrete Beauty | journal = The Craft Report | date = December 1983 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sew To Speak Is Theme For Ribbon For Peace | journal = Quilters Newsletter Magazine | date = November–December 1984 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Levin| first=Adam | title= Works From the Heart: Home Sewers Unite To Tie Up the Pentagon | journal=Sews News| volume=June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = After the Ribbon | journal = Threads Magazine | date = December 1985 – January 1986 | pages = 12, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories leading up to the Pentagon event appeared in over 2,500 publications, including local newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kernan | first = Michael | title = Ribbon Around The Pentagon | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138227300.html | journal = Washington Post | date= September 12, 1984 |page = B1 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boscov | first = Rema | title= Three Years of Peace Work | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138625864.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 16, 1985 | page = C7 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyer | first = Marjorie | title = Prayers for Peace Interwoven | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138619411.html | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10| accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Where to See Ribbon Segments | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138595982.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10 | accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weil | first = Martin | title= Police Say 15-Mile Peace Ribbon Won't Tie Up D.C.

Panels were received from contributors in every state in the United States. Every state and many towns and organizations held Ribbon joining events. Panels were received from all over the world, including Russia, England, Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"&gt;{{cite AV media | title = The Ribbon Starts Here |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FiK79mvYk| accessdate = 2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of women with [[Church Women United]] led a grassroots effort around the country, making panels and assisting with preparations in Washington. Their newsletter, which was sent to a half a million members of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church in America]], the [[Salvation Army]], the [[Quakers]], and 29 other [[Christian denominations]], provided information on how to construct the panels. More than 3,000 Ribbon panels were contributed by this group.&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Janzen | first = Victoria | title = Kansans and The Peace Ribbon Around the Pentagon in the 1980s | url = http://archive.bethelks.edu/ml/issue/vol-64/article/kansans-and-the-peace-ribbon-around-the-pentagon-i/ | journal = Mennonite Life | date = Summer 2010 | volume = 64 | accessdate = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biography of Annabel Hartman | url = http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/annabel-hartman-papers-1981-1990.pdf| publisher = Indiana Historical Society | date = March 31, 2003 | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California delegation contributed over 3,000 panels for the Ribbon event.

Marie Dennis Grosso, Joan Urbanczyk, and Margaret Schellenberg of the Center for a New Creation (a peace group in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia) coordinated the Washington event.

== Events in Washington ==
[[File:Washing National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Each of the 2,500 pews in the cathedral was covered with a panel.]]
[[File:The Ribbon Starts Here.jpg|thumb|Assembly of the Ribbon gets underway at the [[United States Capitol]], Washington, D.C.]]
The interfaith service for peace, held on August 3 at the [[Washington National Cathedral]], was attended by 5,000 people. Cathedral staff reported that it was the second-largest crowd ever hosted in the building.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=150}} Over 4,000 panels were on display during the service. Each pew was decorated, and additional Ribbons were draped and tied in various locations around the building. Twenty bagpipers in Highland dress led a procession of 200 people carrying Ribbons into the cathedral. The service also included dancing, meditation, and a performance by the [[Howard University]] Gospel Choir.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ribbon News Letter"&gt;{{cite journal | title= 'Ribbon' Documentary| journal = The Ribbon Newsletter | volume = October 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were in attendance both at the church service and during The Ribbon event the next day.

When all 27,000 individual panels were joined together on August 4, it created a ribbon {{convert|18|mi}} long.&lt;ref name="Weil" /&gt; Don Wilcox of ''The Craft Report'' described it as "the largest collaborative craft event in American history".&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt; The Ribbon wrapped around the Pentagon building, through the Pentagon parking lot, down the foot paths alongside the [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] and [[Washington Boulevard (Arlington)|Washington Boulevard]], crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Washington D.C. at the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]], and travelled into the [[National Mall]] area. The Ribbon then went past the [[Lincoln Memorial]], along the south side of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]], continuing east along the National Mall, and around the U.S.[[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]]. It then turned west along the north side of the National Mall, went around the Ellipse by the White House, passed the Lincoln Memorial, crossed the Potomac River again and returned to the Pentagon. When the chain of panels was completed, hundreds of balloons were released near the Lincoln Memorial. The entire route was lined with people, and crowds gathered at the three designated speaking areas (the Pentagon, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Capitol). Singers, including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Tom Chapin]], rotated between the three stage areas, performing anti-war songs.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sanders | first = Steve | title = 'Peace Ribbon' Tied Around The Capitol | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-05/news/8502200974_1_chicago-peace-museum-justine-merritt-lincoln-memorial | journal = Chicago Tribune | date = August 5, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=154}} Newspapers estimated a total attendance of 30,000 to 100,000 people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Video filming was done by numerous individuals, and professional television video personnel from New York and Washington, D.C., who donated their time and equipment to create a documentary about the event. The documentary film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'',&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"/&gt; was produced by Academy Award-winning film maker [[Nigel Noble]], and directed by Nigel Noble and Hilary Raff Lindsay; Nobel Enterprises. The video was released in 1988.&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=292}}

The '''Tito–Stalin Split''', or '''Yugoslav–Soviet Split''', was a conflict between the leaders of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which resulted in Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]) in 1948. This was the beginning of the [[Informbiro period]], marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.

==Views==
It was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s national pride and refusal to submit to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [[satellite state]].  The scholar Perovic considered the cause was Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in cooperation with the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jeronim Perovic, "The Tito–Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence." ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (Spring 2007) 9#2 pp: 32-63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. The occupying powers were opposed by several resistance groups; the Communist resistance, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was the largest and took control of the country by 1945, with minimal Soviet intervention. At this point, Tito was loyal to Moscow.

Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia would get more room to follow its own interests than other [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders who had more reason (and came under more pressure) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. This had already led to some friction between the two countries before World War II was even over. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, resulting in an uneasy alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard West, ''Tito'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there occurred several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia successfully captured the territory of [[Istria]], as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]] that had formed part of Italy from the 1920s. This move was of direct benefit to the Slavic populations of the regions (i.e. mainly [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]). Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies and by Stalin. This led to several armed incidents, notably Yugoslav fighter planes shooting down American transport aircraft, causing angry criticism from the West and from Stalin. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/yugoslavia/airforce/victories/ Air victories of Yugoslav Air Force&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt that the USSR was unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II.

In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] not to support communism there with the [[Percentages agreement]]. Tito planned to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control. Stalin could not tolerate that threat.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== First Cominform ==
However, the world still saw the two countries as the closest of allies. This was evident at the first meeting of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, where the Yugoslav representatives were the most strident critics of the national Communist parties viewed to be insufficiently devoted to the cause, specifically the Italian and French parties for engaging in coalition politics. They were thereby essentially arguing Soviet positions. The headquarters for Cominform were even set up in [[Belgrade]]. However, all was not well between the two countries, due to a number of disputes.

== Trip to Moscow ==
The friction that led to the ultimate split had many causes, many of which can ultimately be linked to Tito's regional focus and his refusal to accept Moscow as the supreme Communist authority. The Yugoslavs were of the opinion that the joint-stock companies favored in the Soviet Union were not effective in Yugoslavia. In addition, Tito's deployment of troops in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] to prevent the civil conflict in Greece from spreading into neighbouring countries (including Yugoslavia), carried out without consulting the Soviets, had greatly angered Stalin.

Stalin was also enraged by Tito's aspirations to merge Yugoslavia with Bulgaria (and therefore create a true "Land of the South Slavs"), an idea with which he agreed in theory, but which had also taken place without prior Soviet consultation.&lt;ref&gt;Perovic, "The Tito–Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;   He summoned two of Tito's officials, [[Milovan Đilas]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]], to Moscow to discuss these matters. As a result of these talks, Đilas and Kardelj became convinced that Yugoslav-Soviet relations had already reached an impasse.

== Letter exchange ==
Between the trip to Moscow and the second meeting of the Cominform, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist Party]] (CPY) exchanged a series of letters detailing their grievances. The first CPSU letter, on March 27, 1948, accused the Yugoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as "socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Clissold, ed. ''Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, 1939-1973: A Documentary Survey'' (1975) p 172&lt;/ref&gt;  It also claimed that the CPY was not democratic enough, and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism.  Stalin retorted, "we cannot consider this kind of organization of the Communist Party as truly Marxist-Leninist or Bolshevik. 'One does not feel any policy of class struggle in the Yugoslav Party."&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Kardelj, ''Reminiscences--the Struggle for Recognition and Independence: The New Yugoslavia, 1944-1957'' (1982) p 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPY response on April 13 was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the party, and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. However, the CPY noted also that "no matter how much each of us loves the land of socialism, the USSR, he can in no case love his own country less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennison Rusinow|title=The Yugoslav Experiment 1948-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kChoC2FaS7EC&amp;pg=PA28|year=1978|publisher=U.  of California Press|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet answer on May 4 admonished the CPY for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse the CPY of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had "saved them from destruction". The CPY's response on May 17 reacted sharply to Soviet attempts to devalue the success of the Yugoslav resistance movement, and suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June.

== Second Cominform ==
Tito did not even attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. On June 28, the other member countries expelled Yugoslavia, citing "nationalist elements" that had "managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership" of the CPY. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions.

== Results ==

The expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states. After the expulsion, Tito suppressed those who supported the resolution, calling them "Cominformists".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Garde, ''Vie et mort de la Yougoslavie'', Fayard, Paris, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sent to a [[gulag]]-like prison camp at [[Goli otok]] ("Barren Island").&lt;ref&gt;Serge Métais, ''Histoire des Albanais'', Fayard, Paris 2006, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1948 and 1952, the Soviet Union encouraged its allies to rebuild their military forces—especially [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], which was to be the leading force in a possible war against Yugoslavia.

[[Titoism]] was denounced by Moscow as a heresy that said Communist countries should take a nationalist road to socialism different from that of the Soviet Union.  Across Eastern Europe, Communist leaders suspected of Tito-like tendencies were purged by pro-Moscow elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alec Nove|title=Stalinism and After: The Road to Gorbachev|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stalinism-After-Gorbachev-Alec-Nove/dp/0415094453/|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stalin's death and the repudiation of his policies by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], peace was made with Tito and Yugoslavia re-admitted into the international brotherhood of socialist states. However, relations between the two countries were never completely rebuilt; Yugoslavia would continue to take an independent course in world politics, shunning the influence of both west and east. The [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] maintained two official defense plans, one against a [[NATO]] invasion and one against a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.

Tito used the estrangement from the USSR to obtain US aid via the [[Marshall Plan]], as well as to found the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], in which Yugoslavia was a leading force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yugoslav-American economic relations since World War II|authors=John R.

'''Trans-Love Energies''' is a [[medical marijuana]] compassion center in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

==History==
The organization began in Detroit during the early 1960s as a communal living environment, but later relocated to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Love Energies that was a nucleus of artists who believed in common goals that if the people work together those goals can be reached

Each house was home to a musical band, and to free-thinkers of the time, including members of the [[White Panther]] movement, the ''[[Ann Arbor Argus]]'' newspaper, and the [[MC5]]. The address of their 1486 Gratiot Ave. office is often considered the birthplace of Detroit techno as it housed Kevin Saunderson's KMS Recording in 1982.

==Current role==
The organization has narrowed its scope from the social activism of the 1960s to assisting persons who wish to use marijuana to cope with medical ailments.

{{Governance}}
'''Transnational governance''', within a [[European Union]] framework, is both a subset of [[governance]] in general and an application of it to situations outside its usual limits of corporate or governmental hierarchies, whether regional or national. When such disparate hierarchies within the EU find common goals, typically within a conterminous geographic area, they seek to achieve them by integrating their various policies and activities. The goals of transnational governance, especially for areas previously divided by the [[Iron Curtain]] or pre-EU barriers to [[free trade]] and movement of peoples, is to foster economic and [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transnational Governance: Institutional Dynamics of Regulation | url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/45038/excerpt/9780521845038_excerpt.pdf | work= | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Edited by Marie-Laure Djelic and Kerstin Sahlin-Andersson | accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[economic development]] could be defined as the increased of [[wealth]] of a country or a region and the social development could be loosely defined as the improvements of quality of living for the population. Economic and social are, or at least should be, inseparable concepts. Why reach a high economic development if the inhabitants living in the area don’t see any benefits of that improvement?

In the current global political and economic landscape, particularly within the backdrop of [[globalization]], there is an increase in [[privatization]]. This means that business has started to play an important role in the international order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business and Global Governance|last=Ougaard|first=Morten|last2=Leander|first2=Anna|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415493369|location=London|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related phenomenon called [[public-private partnerships]] (PPPs) is seen as an offshoot of this development. 

Critics, however, cite that a dominance of the private sector and the global capital in the world today is dangerous since it tends to undermine international cooperation and equity among states.&lt;ref&gt;Ougaard &amp; Leander, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There is global consensus, therefore, regarding the need for transnational governance that can regulate and address the gaps on global issues and crises like poverty, climate change, disease, terrorism, and financial crises, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking the Future of Europe: A Challenge of Governance|last=Schepers|first=Stefan|last2=Kakabadse|first2=Andrew|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349438426|location=New York|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-centric [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] international order is unable to cope with these transnational threats, calling for multilateral collaboration that does not only involve states but also other international actors such as non-governmental organizations and multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emerging Transnational (In)security Governance: A Statist-Transnationalist Approach|last=Aydinli|first=Ersel|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=0415563607|location=London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and economic impact===
Reach social and economic developments are already a challenging but it’s even more challenging in a transnational area such as the greater region. Some projects were created in order to foster these developments. The operational program Interreg IV A, “grande region” has for main objectives to make the greater region more attractive, encourage innovation, improve the numbers of high quality jobs, etc.

The improvement of the economic and social situation could be analysed through the example of the Vienna-Bratislava-Györ triangle which is a cross border area including three countries ([[Slovakia]], [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]]) that were once part of the same empire. [[Good governance]] could lead to the adoption of a common identity which could lead to mutual support between people, companies or authorities sharing this common identity. Concretely, we observe a high amount of [[Foreign direct investment]]s (FDI) coming from Austria in order to develop the general situation of Slokia and Hungary. This is very well descriptor in this citation of Tatzberger (2007) : “Foreign direct investments (FDI) play an important role in restructuring and improving the [[competitiveness]] of [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]] by helping to raise [[productivity]] and to expand [[export]]s. It has been one of the driving forces behind industrial restructuring in Hungary and Slovakia”.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Tatzberger, Territorial Cohesion and the European Model of Society (Book), The Vienna-Bratislava-Györ Triangle The European Model of Society in Action, edited by Andreas Faludi&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has to be said to huge economic and social disparities could be seen a real threat to the process leading to the creation of a common identity. For instance, the migration of workers stays underdeveloped because of Austrian fears and restrictions. On one side workers mobility is seen as an important force in enhancing [[economic integration]] of the region but on the other side it could lead to real changes in the social structure especially in Austria due to the migration of very low qualified workers. An important [[brain drain]] could also appear which will make highly decrease the number of educated people who could have been able to develop and teach regional strategic development plan.

A '''veto''' – Latin for "I forbid" – is the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation. A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the [[United Nations Security Council veto power|United Nations Security Council]], whose permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States of America) can block any resolution, or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] may override a Presidential veto of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: From bills to law|Article I, Section 7, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; A veto may give power only to stop changes (thus allowing its holder to protect the [[status quo]]), like the US legislative veto mentioned before, or to also adopt them (an "amendatory veto"), like the legislative veto of the Indian President, which allows him to propose amendments to bills returned to the Parliament for reconsideration.

The concept of a veto body originated with the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman consul|consuls]] and [[tribune]]s. Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The presidential veto: touchstone of the American presidency|pages=1–2|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-88706-802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman veto==
The institution of the veto, known to the Romans as the ''intercessio'', was adopted by the [[Roman Republic]] in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the mandamus interests of the [[plebs]] (common citizenry) from the encroachments of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], who dominated the Senate. A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill, but meant that it was denied the force of law. The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly. The consuls also had the power of veto, as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls. If one disagreed, either could invoke the ''intercessio'' to block the action of the other. The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institutions.&lt;ref name="Spitzer" /&gt;

==Westminster systems==

In [[Westminster system]]s and most [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the power to veto legislation by withholding the [[Royal Assent]] is a rarely used [[reserve power]] of the monarch. In practice, the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of its chief advisor, the prime minister.

===Australia===
Since the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931), the United Kingdom Parliament may not repeal any Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on the grounds that is repugnant to the laws and interests of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=25 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date=9 October 1942 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601205107/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=25 |archive-date=1 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia), such as Canada and New Zealand, are likewise affected. However, according to the [[Australian Constitution]] (sec. 59), the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] may veto a bill that has been given royal assent by the [[Governor-General]] within one year of the legislation being assented to.&lt;ref name="gov.au"/&gt; This power has never been used. The Australian Governor-General himself or herself has, in theory, power to veto, or more technically, withhold assent to, a bill passed by both houses of the [[Australian Parliament]], and contrary to the advice of the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hamer |first=David |author-link=David Hamer |year=2002 |work=Can Responsible Government Survive in Australia? |title=Curiously ill-defined – the role of the head of state |publisher=Australian Government – Department of the Senate |publication-place=Canberra |origyear=1994, University of Canberra |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=9495A9BDD2964D7DB682C13BFA5D4D1A&amp;_z=z |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done without consulting the sovereign as per Section 58 of the constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure. The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |title=Chapter I. The Parliament. Part V – Powers of the Parliament, Section 58 |work=[[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]: [[Australian Senate|Department of the Senate]] |accessdate=13 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193759/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |archivedate=14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[reserve power]] is however, constitutionally arguable, and it is difficult to foresee an occasion when such a power would need to be exercised. It is possible that a Governor-general might so act if a bill passed by the Parliament was in violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Powers of the Governor |url=http://www.govhouse.wa.gov.au/powers.htm |website=Dynamics in Government: A guide to the workings of government in Western Australia |publisher=Constitutional Centre of Western Australia |editor-first=Jolly |editor-last=Read |dead-url=yes |accessdate=15 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406000323/http://www.govhouse.wa.gov.au/powers.htm |archivedate=6 April 2011 |date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue, however, that a government would be hardly likely to present a bill which is so open to rejection. Many of the viceregal reserve powers are untested, because of the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the observance of the convention that the head of state acts upon the advice of his or her chief minister. The power may also be used in a situation where the parliament, usually a [[hung parliament]], passes a bill without the blessing of the executive. The governor general on the advice of the executive could withhold consent from the bill thereby preventing its passage into law.

With regard to the six governors of the states which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth, a somewhat different situation exists. Until the [[Australia Act]] 1986, each state was constitutionally dependent upon the British Crown directly. Since 1986, however, they are fully independent entities, although the Queen still appoints governors on the advice of the state head of government, the [[premier]]. So the Crown may not veto (nor the UK Parliament overturn) any act of a state governor or state legislature. Paradoxically, the states are more independent of the Crown than the federal government and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mediation Communications, Level 3, 414 Bourke Street, Melbourne Vic 3000, Phone 9602 2992, www.mediacomms.com.au |url=http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/role.htm |title=Government House |publisher=Governor.vic.gov.au |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714204231/http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/role.htm |archivedate=14 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; State constitutions determine what role a governor plays. In general the governor exercises the powers the sovereign would have, including the power to withhold the Royal Assent.

===Canada===
{{see also|Disallowance and reservation#In_Canada}}
According to the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Act, 1867]], the [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen in Counsel]] (in practice the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]) may instruct the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to withhold the Queen's assent, allowing the sovereign two years to disallow the bill, thereby vetoing the law in question.  This was last used in 1873, and the power was effectively nullified by the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]].

Provincial viceroys, called "[[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]]" (plural) are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for consideration and possible disallowance by the [[Cabinet of Canada|Federal Cabinet]]; this clause was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Frank Lindsay, [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/bastedo_frank_lindsay_1886-1973.html Encyclopedia of Saskatachewan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{see also|President of India#Important presidential interventions in the past}}

In India, the president has three veto powers, i.e. absolute, suspension &amp; pocket. The president can send the bill back to parliament for changes, which constitutes a limited veto that can be overridden by a simple majority. But the Bill reconsidered by the parliament becomes a law with or without the assents of President after 14 days. The president can also take no action indefinitely on a bill, sometimes referred to as a pocket veto. The president can refuse to assent, which constitutes an absolute veto.&lt;ref name="intro india"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Constitution of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;pg=PA145 | publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Learning Pvt.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In Spain, Section 91 of the Constitution provides that the King shall give his assent to laws passed by the General Courts within 15 days after their final passing by them. The absence of the royal assent, although not constitutionally provided{{clarify|date=September 2012}}, would mean the bill did not become a part of the law. 
Section 90 of the Constitution states that "Within two months after receiving the text, the Senate may, by a message stating the reasons for it, adopt a veto or approve amendments thereto. The veto must be adopted by overall majority."

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the royal veto ("withholding [[Royal Assent]]") was last exercised in 1708 by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] with the [[Scottish Militia Bill 1708]].

The [[House of Lords]] used to have an effective power of veto by refusing to concur in bills adopted by the [[House of Commons]]. However, reform first by a Liberal government and then by a Labour government has limited its powers. The [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949]] reduced its powers: they can now only amend and delay legislation. They can delay legislation for up to one year. Under the 1911 Act, money bills (those concerning finance) cannot be delayed, and under the [[Salisbury Convention]], the Lords, by [[Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom|convention]], cannot delay any bills set out in the governing party's manifesto.

==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Royal Assent]] --&gt;

===According to the Constitution===
{{See also|List of United States presidential vetoes|Line-item veto in the United States|Pocket veto}}
All legislation passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the President. This presentation is in the President's capacity as Head of Government.

If the President approves of the legislation, then the President signs it into law. According to [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 7: Bills|Article 1. Section 7]] of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RS22188.pdf | format = PDF | title = Regular Vetoes and Pocket Vetoes: An Overview  | first = Kevin R. |last = Kosar | date = 18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the President chooses not to sign or does not approve of the bill, the President must return the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], unsigned, within ten days, excluding Sundays, to the house of the [[United States Congress]] in which it originated, while the Congress is [[wikt:in session|in session]]. The President is constitutionally required to state any objections to the bill in writing, and the Congress is constitutionally required to consider them, and to reconsider the legislation. This action, in effect, is a veto.

If the Congress overrides the veto by a [[two-thirds majority|two-thirds vote]] in each house, it becomes law without the President's signature. Otherwise, the bill fails to become law unless it is presented to the President again and the President chooses to sign it.&lt;ref name="US Senate Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Senate Glossary|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/override_of_a_veto.htm|work=US Senate Glossary|publisher=US Senate|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the Congress [[veto override|overrides]] the Presidential veto 7% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Overrides of Presidential Vetoes|first=Mitchel A.|last=Sollenberger|website=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/98-157.pdf|date=April 7, 2004|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill can also become law without the President's signature if, after its presentment, the President simply fails to sign it within the ten days noted. If there are fewer than ten days left in the session before Congress [[wikt:adjourn|adjourns]], and if Congress does so adjourn before the ten days have expired in which the President might sign the bill, then the bill fails to become law. This procedure, when used as a formal device, is called a [[pocket veto]].

===Modifications declared unconstitutional===
In 1983, the Supreme Court had struck down the one-house [[legislative veto]], on [[separation of powers]] grounds and on grounds that the action by one house of Congress violated the Constitutional requirement of bicameralism. The case was ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'', concerning a foreign exchange student in [[Ohio]] who had been born in Kenya but whose parents were from India. Because he was not born in India, he was not an Indian citizen. Because his parents were not Kenyan citizens, he was not Kenyan. Thus, he [[Stateless person|had nowhere to go]] when his student visa expired because neither country would take him, so he overstayed his visa and was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported from the United States.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lena|title=Faces Behind Famous Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/garden/faces-behind-famous-cases.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Immigration and Nationality Act was one of many acts of Congress passed since the 1930s, which contained a provision allowing either house of that legislature to nullify decisions of agencies in the executive branch simply by passing a resolution. In this case, Chadha's deportation was suspended and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a resolution overturning the suspension, so that the deportation proceedings would continue. This, the Court held, amounted to the House of Representatives passing legislation without the concurrence of the Senate, and without presenting the legislation to the President for consideration and approval (or veto). Thus, the Constitutional principle of bicameralism and the separation of powers doctrine were disregarded in this case, and this legislative veto of executive decisions was struck down.

In 1996, the [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[Bill Clinton]] signed, the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]]. This [[Act of Congress|act]] allowed the President to veto individual items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead of vetoing the entire bill and sending it back to the Congress. However, this [[line-item veto]] was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it. In 1998, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled 6-3 to declare the line-item veto unconstitutional. In ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' ({{ussc|524|417|1998}}), the Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole. An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and [[head of state]]—and particularly as a single legislator acting in place of the entire Congress—thereby violating the [[separation of powers]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=51634#axzz2gmSarpIs|title=Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union|publisher=The American Presidency Project|work=Transcript|date=1995-01-24|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being declared unconstitutional, President Clinton had applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008092502/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archivedate=October 8, 2008|title=Supreme Court Strikes Down Line-Item Veto|work=CNN|date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara004.html|title=History of Line Item Veto Notices|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Senator [[Bill Frist]] introduced the [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto, however, the procedure created by the Act provides that, if the President should recommend rescission of a budgetary line item from a budget bill he previously signed into law—a power he already possesses pursuant to U.S. Const. Article II—the Congress must vote on his request within ten days. Because the legislation that is the subject of the President's request (or "Special Message", in the language of the bill) was already enacted and signed into law, the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action, not any kind of veto—whether line-item, legislative or any other sort. The House passed this measure, but the Senate never considered it, so the bill expired and never became law.&lt;ref name=govtrack&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4890|title=H.R. 4890 (109th)|accessdate=October 15, 2018|author=109th Congress (2006)|date=March 7, 2006|work=Legislation|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Senators [[Russ Feingold]] and [[John McCain]] introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a [[majority]] vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaI_6LByaIA |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=YouTube}} Video of reintroduction of Line Item Veto Bill March 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105025838/http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=United States Senate |date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-2-25-2009/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs |publisher=The White House |date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===

====Intent of the Framers====
During the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], the veto was routinely referred to as a 'revisionary power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madison|first1=James |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/debcont.asp|title=Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention |date=1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Veto was constructed not as an absolute veto, but rather with limits, such as that Congress can override a veto, and that the President's objections must be stated in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitzer|first1=Robert J.|title=The Presidential Veto|date=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0887068027|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limits would have been important in the minds of the Founders, given that in Britain the monarch retained an absolute veto (though by this time the power had become a formality). Further, as [[Elbridge Gerry]] explained in the final days of the Convention: "The primary object of the revisionary check of the President is not to protect the general interest, but to defend his own department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madison|first1=James |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_912.asp|title=Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention |date=12 September 1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Constitutional Convention the framers overwhelmingly rejected three proposals for an absolute veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James P.|title=Power Play: The Bush Presidency and the Constitution|date=2009|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|location= Washington, DC|isbn=081570335X|pages=210–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Christopher N.|title=Presidential Defiance of "unconstitutional" Laws: Reviving the Royal Prerogative|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031330064X|pages=876–881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under the Articles and Constitution====
The [[President of the Continental Congress|Presidents]] of the [[Continental Congress]] (1774–81) did not have the power of veto. The President could not veto an act of Congress under the [[Articles of Confederation]] (1781–89), but he possessed certain recess and reserve powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of the Continental Congress. It was only with the enactment of the [[United States Constitution]] (drafted 1787; ratified 1788; fully effective since 4 March 1789) that veto power was conferred upon the person titled "President of the United States".{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The presidential veto power was first exercised on 5 April 1792 when President [[George Washington]] vetoed a bill outlining a new apportionment formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caulfield |first1=Michael |title=Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - Jefferson's Method of Apportionment |journal=Convergence |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=November 2010 |url=https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-jeffersons-method-of-apportionment |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apportionment described how Congress divides seats in the House of Representatives among the states based on the US census figures. President Washington's stated reasons for vetoing the bill were (1) that it did not apportion representatives according to states' relative populations and (2) that it gave eight states more than 1 representative per 30,000 residents, in violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first=George |last=Washington |author-link=George Washington |recipient=House of Representatives |subject=Veto Message of George Washington April 5, 1792 |date=April 5, 1792 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/gwveto1.asp |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |publisher=Bureau of National Literature, Inc. |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress first overrode a presidential veto (passed a bill into law notwithstanding the President's objections) on 3 March 1845.&lt;ref name=veto_history&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf | title=Presidential Vetoes, 1789 to 1988 | format=PDF | date=February 1992 | publisher=The U.S. Government Printing Office | accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. states, veto powers, and override authority===
All U.S. states also have a provision by which legislative decisions can be vetoed by the governor. In addition to the ability to veto an entire bill as a "package," many states allow the governor to exercise specialty veto authority to strike or revise portions of a bill without striking the whole bill.

;Amendatory veto
:Allows a governor to amend bills that have been passed by the legislature. Revisions are subject to confirmation or rejection by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vock|first=Daniel|title=Govs enjoy quirky veto power|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/govs-enjoy-quirky-veto-power-85899386875|publisher=pewstates.org|accessdate=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Line item veto
:Allows a governor to remove specific sections of a bill (usually only spending bills) that has been passed by the legislature. Deletions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Pocket veto
:Any bill presented to a governor after a session has ended must be signed to become law. A governor can refuse to sign such a bill and it will expire. Such vetoes cannot be overridden.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Reduction veto
:Allows a governor to reduce the amounts budgeted for spending items. Reductions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Package veto
:Allows a governor to veto the entire bill. Package vetoes can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;

==European republican systems==

===Presidential veto===
Many European republics allow some form of presidential veto on legislation, which may vary, according to their constitutional form or by convention. These include France, Italy, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary.&lt;!-- There is also another form of presidential veto, which is neglected on this section: pocket veto. --&gt;

The [[President of Austria]] has no veto power, but signs bills into law.

The [[President of Iceland]] may refuse to sign a bill, which is then put to [[referendum]]. This right was not exercised until 2004, by President [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], who has since refused to sign two other bills. The first bill was withdrawn, but the latter two resulted in referenda.

The [[President of France]] has only a very limited form of suspensive veto: when presented with a law, he or she can request another reading of it by the Assembly, but only once per law. Aside from it, the President can only refer bills to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]].

The [[President of Hungary]] has two options to veto a bill: submit it to the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] if he suspects that it violates the constitution or send it back to the [[National Assembly of Hungary|Parliament]] and ask for a second debate and vote on the bill. If the Court rules that the bill is constitutional or it is passed by the Parliament again, respectively, the President must sign it.

The [[President of Ireland]] may refuse to grant assent to a bill that he or she considers to be unconstitutional, after consulting the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]; in this case, the bill is referred to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], which finally determines the matter. This is the most widely used reserve power. The President may also, on request of a majority of [[Seanad Éireann]] (the upper house of parliament) and a third of [[Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house of parliament), after consulting the Council of State, decline to sign a bill "of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained" in an [[ordinary referendum]] or a new Dáil reassembling after a general election held within eighteen months. This latter power has never been used because the government of the day almost always commands a majority of the Seanad, preventing the third of the Dáil that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it.

The [[President of Italy]] may request a second deliberation of a bill passed by Parliament before it is promulgated. This is a very weak form of veto as the Parliament can override the veto by an ordinary majority. The same provision exists in France and Latvia. While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a determined parliamentary majority, it may have a delaying effect and may cause the parliamentary majority to reconsider the matter. The President of Republic can also call a new election for parliament. He can also veto minister nominations, as happened in 2018.

The [[President of Estonia]] may effectively veto a law adopted by [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]] by refusing to proclaim it and demanding a new debate and decision. The parliament, in its turn, may override this veto by passing the law unamended for the second time (a simple majority is enough). In this case the President is obliged to proclaim the law or to request the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]] to declare the law unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court rules that the law does not violate the [[Constitution of Estonia|Constitution]], the President may not object any more and is obliged to finally proclaim the law.

The [[President of Latvia]] may suspend a bill for a period of two months, during which it may be referred to the people in a referendum if a certain number of signatures are gathered. This is potentially a much stronger form of veto, as it enables the President to appeal to the people against the wishes of the Parliament and Government.

The [[President of Poland]] may submit a bill to the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] if he suspects that bill is unconstitutional or send it back to the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] for a second voting. If the Tribunal says that the bill is constitutional or if Sejm passes it by at least three-fifths of the votes, the President must sign the bill.

The [[President of Portugal]] may refuse to sign a bill or refer it, or parts of it, to the [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]]. If the President refuses to sign bill without it being declared unconstitutional, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] (parliament) may pass it again, in which case it becomes law.

The [[President of Ukraine]] may refuse to sign a bill and return it to Parliament with his proposals. If the parliament agrees on his proposals, the President must sign the bill. Parliament may overturn a veto by a two-thirds majority. If Parliament overturns his veto, the President must sign the bill within 10 days.

==Liberum veto==
In the constitution Poland or the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, there was an institution called the [[liberum veto]]. All bills had to pass the ''Sejm'' or "Seimas" (Parliament) by [[unanimous]] consent, and if any legislator voted ''nay'' on anything, this not only vetoed that bill but also dissolved that legislative session itself. The concept originated in the idea of "Polish democracy" as any Pole of noble extraction was considered as good as any other, no matter how low or high his material condition might be. It was never exercised, however, under the rule of the strong Polish royal dynasties, which came to an end in the mid-17th century. These were followed by an elective kingship. As might be expected, the more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the legislature and, combined with a string of weak figurehead kings, led ultimately to the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning and the dissolution of the Polish state]] in the late 18th century.

==Philippines==
The [[President of the Philippines]] may refuse to sign a bill, sending the bill back to the house where it originated along with his objections. [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] can override the veto via a two-thirds vote with both houses voting separately, after which the bill becomes law. The president may also veto specific provisions on [[money bill]]s without affecting other provisions on the same bill. The president cannot veto a bill due to inaction; once the bill has been received by the president, the chief executive has thirty days to veto the bill. Once the thirty-day period expires, the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it.

'''''Veto Players: How Political Institutions Work''''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7419.html Tsebelis, G.: Veto Players: How Political Institutions Work&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a book written by [[political science]] professor [[George Tsebelis]] in 2002. It is a [[game theory]] analysis of political behavior. In this work Tsebelis uses the concept of the [[veto player]] as a tool for analysing the outcomes of political systems. His primary focus is on legislative behaviour and outcomes.

== Veto players ==

The concept of the [[veto]] player is a political actor who has the ability to decline a choice being made. Specifically in Tsebelis' analysis a veto player is one who can stop a change from the status quo. This is analogous to players in a bargaining game where all players must reach agreement.

A key feature of veto players is that they have preferences over public policy outcomes and these are continuous across the continuous policy choices the veto player faces.

There are a number of difficulties with applying the concept of veto players to political systems:

*What is a veto? Although from a game theoretic perspective it is often part of the conditions of the game that agreement must be reached, in practice determining what constitutes a veto is more difficult. For example, although the US president is said to have a veto over legislation, in fact this can be overturned by the legislature. More strikingly, traditionally the British monarch has a veto over legislation (as British Acts require Royal Assent) but this power is never used.
*What is a player? Tsebelis notes that players come in a variety of forms, and may be groups. It may be the case that the veto player is not an individual, for example the US congress. In this case how can the veto player be defined? One way is to look at the constitutional structure of the assembly (the majority of the preferences of the House) however this overlooks the influence of parties and external influences of the lobby groups and the electorate. Tsebslis looks at this by assessing the influence of the different factors on the veto player preferences, arguing that the veto player analysis encompasses issues such as party systems.

== Policy space and social choice within ==

Having established the concept of veto players, Tsebelis then applies this to social choice, following [[Anthony Downs]]' approach of continuous policy space with veto players concerned solely about proximilty of choices to their ideal on a policy spectrum. Further he assumes that there is a status quo point (apparently analogous to a disagreement point in game theoretic bargaining analysis).

He argues that the status quo will only change if it is weakly preferred by all veto players (since otherwise one of the players would veto the social choice). This is analogous to saying that the status quo will only change if the status quo is not [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] for veto players. Tsebelis then suggests that where Pareto improvements are available, the social choice will be for a point which is Pareto efficient. He suggests that in the case where there are many such points, there will be mechanisms to determine which point is reached (although there is no explicit exposition of a bargaining analysis either co-operative or non-cooperative).

Tsebelis then looks at how various veto players resolve certain situation (changing the number of policy dimensions, veto players and status quo points). In so doing he looks at situations with many solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39542">The winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] is selected by a [[positional voting system]]. Each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting.&lt;ref name="biggest_change"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Paul|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975|title=Biggest change to Eurovision Song Contest voting since 1975|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current system has been in place since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]].

==Overview==
Small, demographically-balanced juries made up of ordinary people had been used to rank the entries, but after the widespread use of telephone voting in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]] the contest organizers resorted to juries only in the event of a televoting malfunctions. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], [[Eircom]]'s telephone polling system malfunctioned. Irish broadcaster [[RTÉ]] did not receive the polling results from [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eircom]] in time, and substituted votes by a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|last=Nick|first=Paton Walsh|date=2003-05-30|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1997 and 2003 (the first years of televoting), lines were opened to the public for only five minutes after the performance and recap of the final song. Between 2004 and 2006 the lines were opened for 10 minutes, and from 2007 to 2009 they were opened for 15 minutes. In 2010 viewers were allowed to vote during the performances, but this was rescinded for the 2012 contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[BBC]] contacted regional juries by telephone to choose the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] winners, and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (producers of the contest) later began contacting international juries by telephone. This method continued to be used until 1993. The following year saw the first satellite linkup to juries.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

To announce the votes, the contest's [[List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters|presenters]] connect by satellite to each country in turn and inviting a spokesperson to read the country's votes in [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]. The presenters originally repeated the votes in both languages, but since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] the votes have been translated due to time constraints. To offset increased voting time required by a larger number of participating countries, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] only countries' eight-, 10-, and 12-point scores are read aloud; one- to seven-point votes are added automatically to the scoreboard while each country's spokesperson is introduced. The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a progress bar indicating the number of countries which have voted. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], only the 12-point score is read aloud due to the new voting system, meaning that the nine scoring countries were added automatically to the scoreboard (1-8 and 10 points). In addition, the televoting points are combined together and the presenters announce them in order, starting from the country with the lowest score and ending with the country with the highest score from the televoting.

;Note:{{reflist|group=note}}

The most-used voting system (other than the current one) was last used for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] contest. This system was used from 1957 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1969. Ten jurors in each country each cast one vote for their favourite song. In 1969 this resulted in a four-way tie for first place (between the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Spain), with no tie-breaking procedure. A second round of voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system the following year.

From 1962 to 1966, a voting system similar to the current one was used. In 1962, each country awarded its top three one, two and three points; in 1963 the top five were awarded one, two, three, four and five points, and from 1964 to 1966, each country usually awarded its top three one, three and five points. With the latter system, a country could choose to give points to two countries instead of three (giving three to one and six to the other); in 1965, Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six points and Italy three. Although it was possible to give one country nine points, this never occurred.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] contests saw the jurors "in vision" for the first time. Each country was represented by two jurors: one older than 25 and one younger, with at least ten years' difference in their ages. Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points to each song. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] the previous system of ten jurors was used, and the following year the current system was introduced. Spokespeople were next seen on screen in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] with a satellite link to the venue.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] contest had its first semifinal, with a slight change in voting: countries which did not qualify from the semifinal would be allowed to cast votes in the final. This resulted in Ukraine's [[Ruslana]] finishing first, with a record 280 points. If the voting had been conducted as it had been from 1956 to 2003 (when only finalist countries could vote), [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s [[Željko Joksimović]] would have won the contest with 190 points: a 15-point lead over Ruslana, who would have scored 175 points. To date, non-qualifying countries are still allowed to vote in the final. In 2006, Serbia and Montenegro were able to vote in the semifinal and the final despite their non-participation due to a [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|scandal in the selection process]].

With the introduction of two semifinals in 2008, a new method of selecting finalists was created. The top nine songs (ranked by televote) qualified, along with one song selected by the back-up juries. This method, in most cases, meant that the tenth song in the televoting failed to qualify; this attracted some criticism, especially from [[Republic of Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] (who had placed 10th in the televote in both years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521220118/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-05-21|title=FYR Macedonia threatens Eurovision withdrawal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-05-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=24 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the 2009 final system was used, with a combination of televoting and jury votes from each country also used to select the semi-finalists.&lt;ref name="2010 voting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&amp;_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-10-11|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participating country had a national jury, consisting of five music-industry professionals&lt;ref name=VotingWindow&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Sietse Bakker|Bakker]]|first=[[Sietse Bakker|Sietse]]|title=EBU restores televoting window as from 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=37013&amp;_t=ebu_restores_televoting_window_as_from_2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by national broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-30 |df= }} read 2015-05-20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highest scores ==
"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]" sung by Russian artist [[Polina Gagarina]], became the first song to get over 300 points without winning the contest (and the only one during the era when each country delivered only one set of points); with a new voting system introduced in 2016, Australia became the first country to get over 500 points without winning the contest. In 2017, Bulgaria became the first non-winning entry to score above 600 points, as well as Portugal becoming the first country to get over 750 points - winning the contest as a result of this. As the number of voting countries and the voting systems have varied, it may be more relevant to compare what percentage of all points awarded in the competition that each song received (computed from the published scoreboards [http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results] [http://eurovisionworld.com/?eurovision=2017].

==Tie-breakers==
A [[tie-break]] procedure was implemented after the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969 contest]], in which [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] tied for first place. With no tie-breaking system in place at the time, it was determined that all four countries would be awarded the title; in protest, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year.

In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving points from the greater number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). This rule originally applied only to first place ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2008 has been applied to all places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], the tie-break procedure was implemented when [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and France both had 146 points at the end of the voting. At the time, the tie-break rule was slightly different; the first tie-break rule was not yet in use, and the current rule of first determining the country with the votes from the most countries was not added until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sweden and France had received the maximum twelve points four times; when the number of ten-point scores was counted Sweden, represented by [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]] and "[[Fångad av en stormvind]]", claimed its third victory since it received five ten-point scores against France's two. The French song "[[Le Dernier qui a parlé...]]", performed by [[Amina Annabi|Amina]], finished second with the smallest-ever losing margin.

==Scoring no points==
[[File:Eurovision nul points map.svg|thumb|right|400px|alt=Colour-coded map|Countries with no points, and the number of times for each]]
As each participating country casts a series of preference votes, under the current scoring system it is rare that a song fails to receive any votes at all; such a result means that the song failed to make the top ten most popular songs in any country.

The first zero points in Eurovision were scored in 1962, under a new voting system. When a country finishes with a score of zero, it is often referred to in English-language media as ''nul points'' or ''nil points'', albeit incorrectly. Grammatical French for "no points" is ''pas de points'' or ''zéro point'', but none of these phrases are used in the contest; before 2016's voting overhaul, no-point scores were not announced by the presenters. Following the change in the voting system, a country receiving no points from the public voting is announced as receiving "zero points". {{citation needed|August=2016|date=August 2016}}

The first time a host nation ever finished with ''nul points'' was in the 2015 final, when Austria's "I Am Yours" by The Makemakes scored zero. In 2003, following the UK's first zero score,&lt;ref name="uk2003"/&gt; an online poll was held to determine public opinion about each zero-point entry's worthiness of the score. Spain's "¿Quién maneja mi barca?" (1983) won the poll as the song that least deserved a zero, and Austria's "Lisa Mona Lisa" (1988) was the song most deserving of a zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sechuk.com/TheBigZeroResult.htm|title=The BIG Zero|work=sechuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, although it scored in the combined voting, [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]]'s "[[Echo (You and I)]]" by [[Anggun]] would have received no points if televoting alone had been used. In that year's first semi-final, although [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]]'s "[[Would You? (Iris song)|Would You?]]" by [[Iris (singer)|Iris]] received two points in the televoting-only hypothetical results from the Albanian jury (since Albania did not use televoting); Belgium would have received no official points from televoting alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_2012_split_jury-televote_results_revealed|title=Eurovision 2012 split jury-televote results revealed|work=Eurovision|accessdate=18 June 2012|first=Jarmo|last=Siim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Nul Points'', comic writer [[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim Moore]] interviews several of these performers about how their Eurovision score affected their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nul-Points-Tim-Moore/dp/0099492970|title=Nul Points: Amazon.co.uk: Tim Moore: 9780099492979: Books|work=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of a qualifying round (semifinal) in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2004.pdf|title=Rules of the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|publisher=MyLedbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an expansion to two semifinals in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625184326/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/9327|title=Eurovision: 2 semi finals confirmed!|work=Esctoday|archivedate=25 June 2007|accessdate=25 June 2007|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/9327}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than thirty countries vote each night – even countries which have been eliminated or have already qualified. No points are rarer; it would require a song to place less than tenth in every country in jury voting and televote.

===2016 onwards: One section of voting===
With the new televoting system being introduced in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] contest, scoring no points in either the jury voting or televoting phase is possible. An overall "nul points" is possible, but much less likely, and has not yet happened.

In 2016, the Czech Republic's entry "[[I Stand (song)|I Stand]]" received no points from the televote. They did get 41 points from juries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/voting/ESC-2016-grand_final-full_results.xls |title=ESC 2016 grand final full results |accessdate=15 May 2016 |publisher=Eurovision |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515141453/https://www.eurovision.tv/upload/voting/ESC-2016-grand_final-full_results.xls |archivedate=15 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, Spain's entry "[[Do It for Your Lover]]" received no points from the juries. They did get 5 points from the televote. Also in 2017, Austria's entry "[[Running on Air (song)|Running on Air]]" received no points from the televote but they did get 93 points from juries.

===Junior Eurovision===
No entry in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] has ever received ''nul points''; between 2005 and 2015, each contestant begins with 12 points to prevent such a result.&lt;ref name="12p"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''ESC Today'' |date=26 November 2005 |url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/5208 |title='Your votes please: the spokespersons' |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601191146/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5208 |archivedate=1 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has not been a situation that the 12 points received in the beginning would have remained as the sole points.{{citation needed|August=2016|date=August 2016}} On 15 October 2012, it was announced by the EBU, that for the first time in the contest's history a new ''"{{Esccnty|Kids Jury|Junior}}"'' was being introduced into the voting system. The jury consists of members aged between 10 and 15, and representing each of the participating countries. A spokesperson from the jury would then announce the points 1-8, 10 and the maximum 12 as decided upon by the jury members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siim|first1=Jarmo|title=Extra 'country' to give points in 2012|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=extra_country_to_give_points_in_2012|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2016 Junior Eurovision Song Contest|2016]] the Kids Jury was removed and instead, each country awarded 1-8, 10 and 12 points from both adult and kid's juries, also eliminating televoting from the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Format changes for the Junior Eurovision 2016|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=format_changes_for_the_junior_eurovision_2016|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=17 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expert panel were also present at the 2016 contest, with each of the panelists being able to award 1-8, 10 and 12 points themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Jedward to appear at Junior Eurovision 2016!|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=jedward_to_appear_at_junior_eurovision_2016|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=17 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional bloc voting==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] --&gt;
Although statistical analysis of the results from 2001 to 2005 suggests regional bloc voting;&lt;ref name="Derek"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Derek Gatherer|title=Comparison of Eurovision Song Contest Simulation with Actual Results Reveals Shifting Patterns of Collusive Voting Alliances.|date=2005-09-20|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/2/1.html|accessdate=2007-05-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is debatable whether this is due to political alliances or a tendency for culturally-close countries to have similar musical tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Ginsburgh, Abdul Noury|date=October 2006|title=The Eurovision Song Contest:: Is Voting Political or Cultural?|url=http://164.15.69.62/ecare/personal/ginsburgh/papers/153.eurovision.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom and France would historically exchange points (an average of 6.5 points per contest), and the UK has also had such a relationship with Ireland. Several countries can be categorised as voting blocs, which regularly award one another high points:&lt;ref name="Derek" /&gt;

*Greece and Cyprus
*Turkey and Azerbaijan
*English-speaking countries or countries of the Commonwealth: Australia, Malta, Ireland and United Kingdom
*The former Czechoslovakian countries: Czech Republic and Slovakia
*Austria, Germany and Switzerland
*The Netherlands and Belgium
*Andorra, Portugal and Spain
*The Nordic states: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland
*The Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
*Romania and Moldova, acting as a bridge between the Balkan and Warsaw Pact states
*The Balkan countries:
*:Macedonia and Albania
*:The former Yugoslav countries: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Croatia
*The former [[USSR]] countries of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova
*Hungary and Serbia

It is still common for countries to award points to their neighbours regularly, even if they are not part of a voting bloc (for example, [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]], [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]], the Baltic states and [[Russia]] or [[Albania]] and [[Greece]]). Votes may also be based on a diaspora. [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and the former Yugoslav countries normally get high scores from [[Germany]] or the United Kingdom, [[Armenia]] gets votes from [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Poland]] from [[Ireland]], [[Romania]] from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] and [[Albania]] from [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]]. 
Former Eurovision TV director Bjørn Erichsen disagreed with the assertion that regional bloc voting significantly affects the contest's outcome, saying that Russia's first victory in 2008 was only possible with votes from thirty-eight of the participating countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1135|first = Sietse|last = Bakker|title = Eurovision TV Director responds to allegations on voting|accessdate = 23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent study, &lt;ref name="Mantzaris et al"&gt;Mantzaris, Alexander V., Rein, Samuel R. and Hopkins, Alexander D. "[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/21/1/1.html Examining  Collusion and Voting Biases Between Countries During the Eurovision Song Contest Since 1957.]", ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation''  vol. 21, no. 1. 31 Jan 2018. Retrieved 16 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, a new methodology is presented which allows a complete analysis of the competition from 1957 until 2017. The voting patterns change and the previous studies restrained their analysis to a particular time window where the voting scheme is homogeneous and this approach allows the sampling comparison over arbitrary periods consistent with the unbiased assumption of voting patterns. This methodology also allows for a sliding time window to accumulate a degree of collusion over the years producing a weighted network. The previous results are supported and the changes over time provide insight into the collusive behaviours given more or less choice.

'''''Wén''''' 文 and '''''wǔ''''' 武 - a conceptual pair in [[Chinese philosophy]] and political culture describing opposition and complementarity of civil ① and military ② realms of government. Differentiation between ''wen'' and ''wu'' was engaged in discussions on criminal punishment, administrative control, creation and reproduction of social order, education and moral transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was formed during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Chunqiu]] and [[Warring States]] periods, and best articulated in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE. However, until recently it was not much discussed by the Western scholars because of ① their aberrated perception of the importance of [[Confucianism]] in the pre-imperial and early imperial era, and ② their understanding of Confucianism as pacifist in its nature.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the last is provided by [[John K. Fairbank]]: “Warfare was disesteemed in Confucianism... The resort to warfare (''wu'') was an admission of bankruptcy in the pursuit of ''wen'' [civility or culture]. Consequently, it should be a last resort... Herein lies the pacifist bias of the Chinese tradition... Expansion through ''wen''... was natural and proper; whereas expansion by ''wu'', brute force and conquest, was never to be condoned.”&lt;ref&gt;Yuan-kang Wang, ''Harmony and war: Confucian culture and Chinese power politics''. Columbia University Press, 2011:14. Quote from John K. Fairbank, “Varieties of the Chinese Military Experience,” in Chinese Ways in Warfare, ed. Frank A. Kierman Jr. and John K. Fairbank (Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974), 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the terms ==
The [[posthumous name]]s of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) founders, [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], represent the two terms as standing in the "father-and-son" relationship. Since the [[Battle of Muye|conquest of Shang]] and creation of the Zhou imperial order were the most discussed events of the classical era, the two impersonated terms had very broad currency. However, their origin is presently impossible to pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Garden of Stories|Shuoyuan]]'', compiled by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-6 BCE, Han dynasty), gives a classical example of the terms' balancing against each other: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] enfeoffed [[Bo Qin]] [the Duke of Zhou's son] as the Duke of Lu. Summoning him, he addressed him, saying: "Do you know the Way of acting as the ruler over the people? ... Should you possess the civil but lack the martial, you will have no means to awe those below. Should you possess the martial but lack the civil, the people will fear you but not draw close. If the civil and martial are implemented together, then your awe-inspiring [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] will be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 15, translating from "Jundao" chapter of the ''Shuoyuan''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
