      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;

  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book

  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This is a result of the chemicals interacting with chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;

  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
  |pages=224–225
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Any color perceived by human visitors for a few hours is entirely different from what is really happening.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;  According to Leopold, the three features of [[ecosystem]]s that generate land ethic are integrity, stability and beauty.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; None of the mentioned features are real in nature.  Ecosystems are not stable: they are dramatically changing and they have little integration; ergo, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

==Objectives==
In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating a natural thing, we give meaning to the thing we appreciate and in that meaning, we express and develop our own attitudes, values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Parsons|first=G.
  |title=Aesthetics and Nature
  |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our interest in natural things are not only a passive reflection of our inclinations, as Croce describes as the appreciation of nature as looking in a mirror, or what we might call our inward life; but may instead be the things we come across in nature that engage and stimulate our imagination.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; As a result, we are challenged to think differently and apply thoughts and associations to in new situations and ways.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;
 
As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications. On the contrary, there are not obvious instances of debate and appraisals where different judgments about the aesthetics of character of nature are evaluated.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] has been narrowed down to 21 million years, based on a number of projects that all give extremely close figures for the age. These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |date=2 April 2013

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Planck==
In 2015, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck Collaboration]]  estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data. By combining the Planck data with external data, the best combined estimate of the age of the universe is {{val|13.799|0.021|e=9|u=years}} old.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA on Planck 2015"/&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.
 |date=1915
 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie
 |journal=Sitzungsberichte [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften]]
 |pages=778–786
 |language=German
 |bibcode=1915SPAW.......778E
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Sandage |first1=A. R.

 |bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S
 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.

}}

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C.

It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

In energy monitoring and targeting, a '''driving factor''' is something recurrent and measurable whose variation explains variation in energy consumption. The term ''independent variable'' is sometimes used as a synonym.

One of the most common driving factors is the weather, expressed usually as heating or cooling [[degree day]]s. In energy-intensive processes, production throughputs would usually be used. For electrical circuits feeding outdoor lighting, the number of hours of darkness can be employed. For a borehole pump, the quantity of water delivered would be used; and so on. What these examples all have in common is that on a weekly basis (say) numerical values can be recorded for each factor and one would expect particular streams of energy consumption to correlate with them either singly or in a multi-variate model.

Correlation is arguably more important than causality. Variation in the driving factor merely has to ''explain'' variation in consumption; it does not necessarily have to ''cause'' it, although that will in most scenarios be the case.

Driving factors differ from ''static'' factors, such as building floor areas, which determine energy consumption but change only rarely (if at all).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">The '''Dukhin number''' ('''{{math|Du}}''') is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]] to various [[electrokinetic]] and electroacoustic effects, as well as to [[electrical conductivity]] and [[permittivity]] of fluid [[heterogeneous]] systems. 

==Overview==
It was introduced by Lyklema in “Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science”.&lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J.J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-12-460524-4}}.&lt;!-- 10.1016/S1874-5679(06)80006-1? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent IUPAC Technical Report used this term explicitly and detailed several means of measurement in physical systems.&lt;ref name='PAC'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Delgado |first1=A. V. |last2=González-Caballero |first2=F. |last3=Hunter |first3=R. J. |last4=Koopal |first4=L. K. |last5=Lyklema |first5=J.  |year=2005 |title=Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1753–1805 |doi=10.1351/pac200577101753|url=http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/29099/1/DelgadoMeasurements.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity
* η is [[dynamic viscosity]]

In [[physics]], '''energy''' is the [[physical quantity|quantitative]] [[physical property|property]] that must be [[#Energy transfer|transferred]] to an [[Physical body|object]] in order to perform [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on, or to [[heat]], the object.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[second law of thermodynamics]] imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be {{em|[[waste heat|consumed]]}} in the form of [[heat]] instead. See e.g. {{cite journal |last1=Lehrman |first1=Robert L. |title=Energy Is Not The Ability To Do Work |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=15–18 |issn=0031-921X |doi=10.1119/1.2349846|bibcode=1973PhTea..11...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]; the law of [[conservation of energy]] states that energy can be [[Energy transformation|converted]] in form, but not created or destroyed. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].

Common forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].

[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].

Living organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]

The total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object – or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object – and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐνέργεια|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.

In 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy – a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-226-76420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.&lt;ref name="jphysics"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey &amp; Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 – Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=978-0-7016-3777-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]
{{Main article|Units of energy}}

In 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the "Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

==Scientific use==

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the work (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

===Chemistry===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here --&gt;
In the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&amp;nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−''E''/''kT''&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]
{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&amp;nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of a given amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bicycle calculator – speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Bike Calculator |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals – to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie|Calories]] (6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[stearin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]
::&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
::C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 81.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 57CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 55H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
and some of the energy is used to convert [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] into [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].
::ADP + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:&lt;ref group=note&gt;These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the [[power (physics)|power]] output of the sprinter and the [[force (physics)|force]] of the weightlifter.

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficient (in the physical sense)]] in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real [[machine]]s manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in [[ecology]]: to take just the first step in the [[food chain]], of the estimated 124.7&amp;nbsp;Pg/a of carbon that is [[carbon fixation|fixed]] by [[photosynthesis]], 64.3&amp;nbsp;Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants,&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Akihito; Oikawa, Takehisa (2004).

===Earth sciences===
In [[Earth science#earth's energy|geology]], [[continental drift]], [[mountain|mountain ranges]], [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |title=Earth's Energy Budget |publisher=Okfirst.ocs.ou.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194704/http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[metereology|meteorological]] phenomena like wind, rain, [[hail]], snow, lightning, [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] are all a result of energy transformations brought about by [[solar energy]] on the [[atmosphere]] of the planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here --&gt;
In [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{Main article|Energy operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]
as a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.

===Relativity===
When calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically – using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;,
where
:''m'' is the mass of the body,
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
:''&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the rest energy.

For example, consider [[electron]]–[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the [[stress–energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system ("mass manifestations"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating ("energy manifestations"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy–momentum 4-vector]]).&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).

==Transformation==
{{Main article|Energy transformation}}

{{Forms of energy transfer}}
[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]
Energy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.

Examples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) to kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The equation can then be simplified further since &lt;math&gt;E_p = mgh&lt;/math&gt; (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt; (half&amp;nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding &lt;math&gt;E_p + E_k = E_{total}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J.J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&amp;nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~&lt;math&gt;9\times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.

==Conservation of energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}
The fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman&lt;/ref&gt;

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"/&gt; The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:&lt;ref name="RPF1"/&gt;
{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law – it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}

Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws |publisher=Physics.ucla.edu |date=1918-07-16 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514080739/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm ''The Laws of Thermodynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215201900/http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} including careful definitions of energy, free energy, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|year=1964|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=U.S.A| isbn=978-0-201-02115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of [[translational symmetry]] of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |title=Time Invariance |publisher=Ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210455/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } &lt;/math&gt;

which is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.

==Energy transfer==
===Closed systems===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]]. Here, the signs in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; represents the work done on the system, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes ignored, especially when the [[thermal efficiency]] of the transfer is high.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This simplified equation is the one used to define the [[joule]], for example.

===Open systems===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, one may write

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

==Thermodynamics==

===Internal energy===
[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

===First law of thermodynamics===
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7167-1088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the system and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work applied to the system.

===Equipartition of energy===
The energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system’s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

An '''energy being''' or '''astral being''' is a theoretical [[life form]] that is composed of [[energy]] rather than [[matter]]. They appear in [[myth]]s/[[legend]]s, [[paranormal]]/[[UFO]] accounts, and in various works of [[speculative fiction]].

Energy beings are typically rendered as a translucent glowing fluid or as a collection of flames or electrical sparks or bolts; somewhat in common with the representations of [[ghost]]s.

Energy beings have a variety of capacities. The Taelons (from ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'') are barely more powerful than mortals, while others such as ''[[Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s Ascended Ancients/Ori, ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''{{'}}s [[List of Ben 10 characters#Verdona Tennyson|Anodites]], or the Meekrob from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' possess god-like powers.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1037">The '''Fowkes hypothesis''' (after F. M. Fowkes) is a first order approximation for surface energy. It states the surface energy is the sum of each component's forces:
 
γ=γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;+...
where γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; is the dispersion component, γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; is the polar, γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the dipole and so on.

The Fowkes hypothesis goes further making the approximation that the interface between an apolar liquid and apolar solid where there are only dispersive interactions acting across the interface can be estimated using the [[geometric mean]] of the contributions from each surface i.e.

γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;=γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-2(γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; x γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">'''Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy (IPSS)''' is a Passive Seismic Low Frequency technique used for mapping potential oil and gas hydrocarbon accumulations.

It is part of the geophysical techniques also known under the generic naming [[passive seismic]] which includes also the [[Seismic tomography|Passive Seismic Tomography]] and Micro Seismic Monitoring for petroleum, gas and geothermal applications. In a larger scale, Passive Seismic includes the [[IRIS Consortium|Global Seismic Network]] earthquakes monitoring (GSN).

Regarding petroleum and geothermal exploration (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks is the main responsible for the low frequency reservoir-related [http://www.pgexploration.com/resources/publications/ wavefield absorption].
 
The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by [https://books.google.it/books?id=_TkPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=mesoscopic+homogeneous+seismic+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJtCq_D0ip&amp;sig=uPNi3LY5j98O84W-7Sdntefr0sU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuKqmqazXAhVPahoKHbHdBsAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoscopic%20homogeneous%20seismic%20models&amp;f=false mesoscopic homogeneous models]) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range.
 
Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low frequency wave field.

Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy techniques quantifies then the absorption and the wave field dispersion within the low frequency bandwidth giving the most predominant areas linked with possible oil-saturated and porous media.

The low frequency seismic field is not usually reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the vibroseis currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The '''ion vibration current''' ('''IVI''') and the associated '''ion vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.

Historically, the IVI was the first known [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]]. It was predicted by [[Peter Debye]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Debye, P. |title=A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions |journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=1 |page=13 |year=1933 |doi=10.1063/1.1749213|bibcode=1933JChPh...1...13D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]] travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of [[g-force|g's]]. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a [[centrifuge]], or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the [[equivalence principle]], which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to [[buoyant force]]), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid.

IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating [[electric potential]] between various points in a [[sound wave]].

This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion [[solvation]]. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Zana, R. and Yeager, E. |title=Ultrasonic Vibration Potentials |journal=Mod. Aspects of Electrochemistry |volume=14 |page=1 |year=1982 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-7458-3_1|isbn=978-1-4615-7460-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|Samuel Clarke.]]
The '''Leibniz–Clarke correspondence''' was a [[scientific]], [[theological]] and [[philosophical]] [[debate]] conducted in an exchange of letters between the [[Germany|German]] thinker [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], an [[England|English]] supporter of [[Isaac Newton]] during the years 1715 and 1716.  The exchange began because of a letter Leibniz wrote to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], in which he remarked that Newtonian physics was detrimental to [[natural theology]].  Eager to defend the Newtonian view, Clarke responded, and the correspondence continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of subjects is touched on in the letters, the main interest for modern readers is in the dispute between the [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] theory of [[space]] favoured by Newton and Clarke, and Leibniz's [[Relational space|relational]] approach.  Also important is the conflict between Clarke's and Leibniz's opinions on [[free will]] and whether God must create the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had published only a book on moral matters, the ''[[Theodicy|Theodicée]]'' (1710), and his more metaphysical views had never been exposed to a sufficient extent, so the collected letters were met with interest by their contemporaries. The priority dispute between [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy|Leibniz and Newton about the calculus]] was still fresh in the public's mind and it was taken as a matter of course that it was Newton himself who stood behind Clarke's replies.

==Editions==
The Leibniz-Clarke letters were first published under Clarke's name in the year following Leibniz' death.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Papers, which passed between the late Learned Mr. Leibniz, and Dr. Clarke, In the Years 1715 and 1716'', by Samuel Clarke D.D. (London:  James Knapton, 1717)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a preface, took care of the translation from French, added notes and some of his own writing. In 1720 [[Pierre Desmaizeaux]] published a similar volume in a French translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil de pièces diverses sur la philosophie la religion et l'histoire par Leibniz, Clarke et Newton'', publiées par Pierre Desmaizeaux, Amsterdam, 1720&lt;/ref&gt; including quotes from Newton's work. It is quite certain that for both editions the opinion of Newton himself has been sought and Leibniz left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoloni-Melli D., ''Newton and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'',  The Cambridge Companion to Newton,   eds. I. B. Cohen and G. E. Smith, Cambridge University Press,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the German translation of the correspondence published by Kohler, also in 1720,&lt;ref&gt;''Merckwurdige Schriften welche . . . zwischen dem Herrn Baron von Leibniz und dem Herrn D. Clarke über besondere Materien der naturlichen Religion'' in Franzos. und Englischer Sprache gewechselt und . . . in teutscher Sprache herausgegeben worden von Heinrich Kohler, Frankfurt and Leipzig (Jena), 1720: there was a preface by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and a reply to Clarke's last letter in  behalf of Leibniz by Ludwig Philipp Thümmig; it appeared also in the latin translation from 1740.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a reply to Clarke's last letter which Leibniz had not been able to answer. The letters have been reprinted in most collections of Leibniz' works and regularly published in stand alone editions.&lt;ref&gt;A full list is given in Alexander H., ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence'',  with extracts from Newton's ''Principia'' and ''Opticks'', edited with an introduction and notes, Manchester, 1955 (and reeditions); for a more recent edition see e.g.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by [[latitude]] and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/pastcc.html|title = Past Climate Change|publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Anderson|author2=Bernard Walter|date = March 28, 1997|url = http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |title = History of Climate Change|publisher = NASA|accessdate = January 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123130745/http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Weart|first = Spencer|date=June 2006|url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|publisher = American Institute of Physics|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water on Earth==
[[File:44 - Iguazu - Décembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]
{{Main|Water}}
'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=June 25, 2008
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===

{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)

&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

=== Misconceptions on its size === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universe]] --&gt;
[[File:Incorrect plaque at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, April 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City.]]
Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt;

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===
[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale. [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called the "cosmic web". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.

Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm).

The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T.

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

The most distant [[astronomical object]] yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified [[GN-z11]]. In 2009, a [[gamma ray burst]], [[GRB 090423]], was found to have a [[redshift]] of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old.&lt;ref name="NASAGRB"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/28apr_grbsmash/ New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record – NASA Science].

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | first1 = Helmuth-M | last1 = Groscurth
 | date = 1 July 1995
 | title = Design and management of energy databases

 | volume = 17
 | number = 4
 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | title = Open geospatial data for energy planning

 | url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:927179/FULLTEXT02
 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1 = Pfenninger | first1 = Stefan
 | last2 = DeCarolis | first2 = Joseph
 | last3 = Hirth | first3 = Lion
 | last4 = Quoilin | first4 = Sylvain
 | last5 = Staffell | first5 = Iain
 | date = February 2017
 | title = The importance of open data and software: is energy research lagging behind?
 | journal = Energy Policy
 | volume = 101
 | pages = 211–215
 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.046
 | issn = 0301-4215

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker
 | date = 21 November 2016
 | title = Energy databases: protection and licensing
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwaelte
 | location = Berlin, Germany

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09
 | date = 10 December 2017
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d659fda325438884e6e78b372772ed7069633f97.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The same data is usually also provided as [[Office Open XML|XLSX]] ([[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) and [[SQLite]] files.  The datasets can be accessed in real-time using stable [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts deployed for data processing are available on [[GitHub]] and carry an [[MIT license]].  The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

[[Renewables.ninja]] is a website that can calculate the hourly power output from [[photovoltaics|solar photovoltaic]] installations and [[wind farm]]s located anywhere in the world.  The website is a joint project between the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland and the [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/ Centre for Environmental Policy], [[Imperial College London]], [[London]], United Kingdom.  The website went live during September 2016.  The resulting time series are provided under a Creative Commons {{nowrap|CC BY-NC 4.0}} license and the underlying power plant models are published using a [[BSD-new]] license.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only the solar model, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], has been released.&lt;ref name="renewables-ninja-website"&gt;

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9146">The '''particle horizon''' (also called the '''cosmological horizon''', the '''comoving horizon''' (in Dodelson's text), or the '''cosmic light horizon''') is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particle]]s could have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the universe]]. Much like the concept of a [[horizon|terrestrial horizon]], it represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt; so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R. Liddle|author2=David Hilary Lyth|title=Cosmological inflation and large-scale structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=13 April 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57598-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the [[age of the universe]] times the [[speed of light]] (approximately 13.8 billion light-years), but rather the speed of light times the [[conformal time]]. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]].

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of [[comoving distance]], the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; that has passed since the [[Big Bang]], times the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the conformal time at a certain time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], and we have taken the Big Bang to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates "today" so that the conformal time today &lt;math&gt;\eta(t_0) = \eta_0 = 1.48 \times 10^{18}\text{ s}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the conformal time is not the [[age of the universe]]. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Paul Hobson|author2=George Efstathiou|author3=Anthony N.

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) H_p(t) = a(t) \int_{0}^{t} \frac{c\,dt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;

and for today &lt;math&gt;t = t_0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_0) = c\eta_0 = 14.4\text{ Gpc} = 46.9\text{ billion light years}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the [[FLRW]] cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, partial pressure &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and state equation &lt;math&gt;p_i=\omega_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that they add up to the total density  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and total pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Hubble function   &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\dot a}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The critical density   &lt;math&gt;\rho_c=\frac{3}{8\pi}H^2&lt;/math&gt;

* The redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; given by the formula   &lt;math&gt;1+z=\frac{a_0}{a(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

Any function with a zero subscript denote the function evaluated at the present time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\sum \Omega_{i0}(1+z)^{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i=3(1+\omega_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{The particle horizon } H_p \text{ exists if and only if } N&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the largest &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH_p}{dt}=H_p(z)H(z)+c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for [[event horizon]].

==Horizon problem==
{{main|Horizon problem}}
The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the [[Big Bang]] model. Extrapolating back to the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = c\eta_\text{CMB} = 284\text{ Mpc} = 8.9 \times 10^{-3} H_p(t_0) &lt;/math&gt;}}

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; a_\text{CMB}H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = 261\text{ kpc} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (&lt;math&gt;284\text{ Mpc} \ll 14.4\text{ Gpc}&lt;/math&gt;), our expectation is that parts of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a [[great circle]] across the sky of

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{H_p(t_\text{CMB})}{H_p(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

(an [[angular size]] of &lt;math&gt;\theta \sim 1.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Power Spectrum|url=http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be out of [[causal contact]] with each other. That the entire CMB is in [[thermal equilibrium]] and approximates a [[blackbody]] so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the [[expansion of the universe]] proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is [[cosmic inflation]].

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3D coordinate system.svg|thumb|right|A right-handed three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] used to indicate positions in space.&lt;!--(See diagram description for needed correction.)--&gt;]]
'''Space''' is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [[Physical body|objects]] and events have relative position and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068962/space|title=Space – Physics and Metaphysics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical space is often conceived in three [[linear]] [[dimension]]s, although modern [[physics|physicists]] usually consider it, with [[time]], to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] known as [[spacetime]]. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [[universe]]. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a [[conceptual framework]].

Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' of [[Plato]], or [[Socrates]] in his reflections on what the Greeks called ''[[khôra]]'' (i.e. "space"), or in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of ''topos'' (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space ''qua'' extension" in the ''Discourse on Place'' (''Qawl fi al-Makan'') of the 11th-century Arab polymath [[Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to Plato's ''Timaeus'' in the Loeb Classical Library, [[Harvard University]], and to his reflections on ''khora''. See also Aristotle's ''Physics'', Book IV, Chapter 5, on the definition of ''topos''. Concerning Ibn al-Haytham's 11th century conception of "geometrical place" as "spatial extension", which is akin to [[Descartes]]' and Leibniz's 17th century notions of ''extensio'' and ''analysis situs'', and his own mathematical refutation of Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' in natural philosophy, refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]), Vol. 17 (2007), pp. 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the [[Renaissance]] and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of [[classical mechanics]]. In [[Isaac Newton]]'s view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.&lt;ref&gt;French, A. J.; Ebison, M. G. (1986). ''Introduction to Classical Mechanics''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[natural philosopher]]s, notably [[Gottfried Leibniz]], thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their [[distance]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]] from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian [[George Berkeley]] attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision''. Later, the [[metaphysic]]ian [[Immanuel Kant]] said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' as being a subjective "pure ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' form of intuition".

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], in which space is conceived as ''curved'', rather than ''flat''. According to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], space around [[gravitational field]]s deviates from Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1995). ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. New York: Dove. (Original edition: ''Philosophical Foundations of Physics''. New York: Basic books, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[tests of general relativity]] have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

== Philosophy of space ==

=== Galilei ===
[[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] theories about space, matter and motion are at the foundation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], which is understood to have culminated with the publication of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855123|title=Space from Zeno to Einstein : classic readings with a contemporary commentary|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|others=Huggett, Nick.|isbn=058505570X|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42855123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the most influential in Physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janiak|first=Andrew|year=2015|title=Space and Motion in Nature and Scripture: Galileo, Descartes, Newton|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=51|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the pioneers of [[modern science]], Galilei revised the established [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] ideas about a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmos. He backed the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that the universe was [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]], with a stationary sun at the center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galilei wanted to prove instead that the sun moved around its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galilei, celestial bodies, including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47691120|title=Time and space|last=1958–|first=Dainton, Barry,|date=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773523022|location=Montreal|oclc=47691120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== René Descartes ===
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] set out to replace the Aristotelian worldview with a theory about space and motion as determined by [[natural law]]s. In other words, he sought a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundation or a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] explanation for his theories about matter and motion. [[Cartesian space]] was [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] in structure—infinite, uniform and flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Space|last=Dainton|first=Barry|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined as that which contained matter; conversely, matter by definition had a spatial extension so that there was no such thing as empty space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body, mind and matter.  He is famously known for his "cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am), or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt, and therefore think and therefore exist. His theories belong to the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition, which attributes knowledge about the world to our ability to think rather than to our experiences, as the [[Empiricism|empiricists]] believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/428970574|title=Descartes : a very short introduction|last=Tom.|first=Sorell,|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191540363|location=Oxford|oclc=428970574}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited a clear distinction between the body and mind, which is referred to as the [[Mind–body dualism|Cartesian dualism]].

=== Leibniz and Newton ===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]|upright|thumb]]
Following Galilei and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the [[philosophy of space and time]] revolved around the ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a German philosopher-mathematician, and [[Isaac Newton]], who set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Fifth letter to Samuel Clarke. By H. G. Alexander (1956). ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 55–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Unoccupied regions are those that ''could'' have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised [[abstraction]] from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] but must be [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Vailati, E. (1997). ''Leibniz &amp; Clarke: A Study of Their Correspondence''. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. (1992). ''Philosophy of Physics''. Boulder: Westview Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the [[identity of indiscernibles]], there would be no real difference between them. According to the [[principle of sufficient reason]], any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|[[Isaac Newton]]|upright|thumb]]
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on [[observation]] and experimentation. For a [[Relational theory|relationist]] there can be no real difference between [[inertial frame of reference|inertial motion]], in which the object travels with constant [[velocity]], and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial motion]], in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates [[force]]s, it must be absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the example of [[Bucket argument|water in a spinning bucket]] to demonstrate his argument. Water in a [[bucket]] is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Newton_bucket.html|title=Newton's bucket|work=st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.

=== Kant ===
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
In the eighteenth century the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed a theory of [[knowledge]] in which knowledge about space can be both ''a priori'' and ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, knowledge about space is ''synthetic'', in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=John Randolph |authorlink=John Lucas (philosopher) |title= Space, Time and Causality |page=149 |isbn=0-19-875057-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===
{{main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}

[[Image:Sphere closed path.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Spherical geometry]] is similar to [[elliptical geometry]]. On a [[sphere]] (the [[Surface (topology)|surface]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) there are no [[parallel line]]s.]]Euclid's ''Elements'' contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the [[parallel postulate]], has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] on which there is a straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a point ''P'' not on ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is exactly one straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the plane that passes through the point ''P'' and is parallel to the straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1830 though, the Hungarian [[János Bolyai]] and the Russian [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called [[hyperbolic geometry]]. In this geometry, an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parallel lines pass through the point ''P''. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is greater than [[pi]]. In the 1850s, [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed an equivalent theory of [[elliptical geometry]], in which no parallel lines pass through ''P''. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180° and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than [[pi]].

=== Gauss and Poincaré ===
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]]]
[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], a German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space. He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by [[triangulation|triangulating]] mountain tops in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]], a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century, introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, Max (1954). ''Concepts of Space. The History of Theories of Space in Physics''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties, known as a [[sphere-world]]. In this world, the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere. With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface.&lt;ref&gt;A medium with a variable index of refraction could also be used to bend the path of light and again deceive the scientists if they attempt to use light to map out their geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. For him, which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of [[Conventionalism|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Euclidean geometry]] is simpler than non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed the former would always be used to describe the 'true' geometry of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Einstein ===
[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published his [[special theory of relativity]], which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as ''[[spacetime]]''. In this theory, the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers—which has [[relativity of simultaneity|the result]] that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to [[time dilation|tick more slowly]] than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured [[length contraction|to be shortened]] in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.

Subsequently, Einstein worked on a [[general theory of relativity]], which is a theory of how [[gravity]] interacts with spacetime. Instead of viewing gravity as a [[Force field (physics)|force field]] acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the general theory, time [[gravitational time dilation|goes more slowly]] at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. Scientists have studied the behaviour of [[binary pulsar]]s, confirming the predictions of Einstein's theories, and non-Euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime.

== Mathematics ==
{{main|Three-dimensional space}}
{{distinguish|Space (mathematics)}}
In modern mathematics [[Mathematical space|spaces]] are defined as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] with some added structure. They are frequently described as different types of [[manifold]]s, which are spaces that locally approximate to Euclidean space, and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold. There are however, many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces. For example, [[vector space]]s such as [[function space]]s may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from Euclidean space, and [[topological space]]s replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.

== Physics ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
Space is one of the few [[fundamental quantity|fundamental quantities]] in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other fundamental quantities (like time and [[mass]]), space can be explored via [[measurement]] and experiment.

Today, our [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]], called [[Minkowski space]] (see [[special relativity]]).  The idea behind space-time is that time is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each of the three spatial dimensions.

=== Relativity ===
{{main|Theory of relativity}}
Before [[Einstein]]'s work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–[[spacetime]]. It turns out that distances in [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space]] or in [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|time]] separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time along [[space-time interval]]s are—which justifies the name.

In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space-time. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in [[special relativity]] (where time is sometimes considered an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] coordinate) and in [[general relativity]] (where different signs are assigned to time and space components of [[spacetime]] [[metric tensor|metric]]).

Furthermore, in [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]], it is postulated that space-time is geometrically distorted- ''curved'' -near to gravitationally significant masses.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. ''A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime''. Chapters 8 and 9, [[Scientific American]], {{ISBN|0-7167-6034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of space-time, called [[gravitational wave]]s. While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] system, for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations. LIGO scientists reported the [[first observation of gravitational waves|first such direct observation of gravitational waves]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castelvecchi|first1=Davide|last2=Witze|first2=Alexandra|title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Nature News|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL"&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

&lt;/ref&gt; and has been expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]].

== Spatial measurement ==
{{main|Measurement}}
The measurement of ''physical space'' has long been important. Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the [[SI|International System of Units]], (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used.

Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the [[special theory of relativity]] in which the [[speed of light]] plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature.

== Geographical space ==
{{See also|Spatial analysis}}

[[Geography]] is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on [[Earth]], utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations. [[Cartography]] is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device. [[Geostatistics]] apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena.

Geographical space is often considered as land, and can have a relation to [[ownership]] usage (in which space is seen as [[property]] or territory). While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership, while still other cultures such as [[Australian Aboriginals]], rather than asserting ownership rights to land, invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land. [[Spatial planning]] is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior, being an important factor in architecture, where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures, and on farming.

Ownership of space is not restricted to land. Ownership of [[airspace]] and of [[International waters|waters]] is decided internationally. Other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces—for example to the radio bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or to [[cyberspace]].

[[Public space]] is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while [[private property]] is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.

[[Abstract space]] is a term used in [[geography]] to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity. When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit [[extraneous variables]] such as terrain.

== In psychology ==
Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century. Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of [[psychology]]. Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object's physical appearance or its interactions are perceived, see, for example, [[visual space]].

Other, more specialized topics studied include [[amodal perception]] and [[object permanence]]. The [[perception]] of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to [[hunting]] and [[self preservation]] as well as simply one's idea of [[personal space]].

Several space-related [[phobia]]s have been identified, including [[agoraphobia]] (the fear of open spaces), [[wikt:astrophobia|astrophobia]] (the fear of celestial space) and [[claustrophobia]] (the fear of enclosed spaces).

The understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using [[visual perception#Unconscious inference|unconscious inference]], and is closely related to [[hand-eye coordination]]. The visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called [[depth perception]].

== In the Social Sciences ==
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[urban theory]] and [[critical geography]]. These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism, transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place. The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s, after the publication of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s ''The Production of Space .'' In this book, Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product. His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henri Lefebvre on Space : Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory.|last=Stanek|first=Lukasz|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Condition of Postmodernity,'' [[David Harvey]] describes what he terms the "[[time-space compression]]." This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time, space and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0025.xml|title=Time-Space Compression – Geography – Oxford Bibliographies – obo|access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology. These advances create relationships across time and space, new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers, all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaces of Capital : Towards a Critical Geography|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Thirdspace,'' [[Edward Soja]] describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the "[[trialectics of being]]," the three modes that determine how we inhabit, experience and understand the world. He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience, neglecting the spatial dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33863376|title=Thirdspace : journeys to Los Angeles and other real-and-imagined places|last=W.|first=Soja, Edward|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1557866740|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=33863376}}&lt;/ref&gt; He builds on Henri Lefebvre's work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined. Lefebvre's "lived space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22624721|title=The production of space|last=1901–1991.|first=Lefebvre, Henri,|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631140484|location=Oxford, OX, UK|oclc=22624721}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soja's "thridspace" are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place, which "firstspace" and "Secondspace" (Soja's terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass.

[[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s concept of [[Third Space Theory|Third Space]] is different from Soja's Thirdspace, even though both terms offer a way to think outside the terms of a [[Binary opposition|binary]] logic. Bhabha's Third Space is the space in which hybrid cultural forms and identities exist. In his theories, the term [[Hybridity|hybrid]] describes new cultural forms that emerge through the interaction between colonizer and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/824119565|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946–|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943–, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946–|isbn=9780415661904|edition= Third|location=London|oclc=824119565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

The '''three-torus model''' is a [[cosmological model]] proposed in 1984 by [[Alexei Starobinsky]] and [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] at the Landau Institute in Moscow.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Overbeye, Dennis.  ''New York Times'' 11 March 2003: Web. 16 January 2011. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/science/universe-as-doughnut-new-data-new-debate.html “Universe as Doughnut: New Data, New Debate”]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory describes the [[shape of the universe]] (topology) as a [[Three-torus#Three-dimensional torus|three-dimensional torus]]. It is also informally known as the '''[[doughnut]] theory'''.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}

== Shape of the universe ==
{{main|Shape of the universe|Illustris project}}

The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was discovered by [[Bell Labs]] in 1964. Greater understanding of the universe's CMB provided greater understanding of the universe's topology{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}.  In order to understand these CMB results, [[NASA]] supported development of two exploratory satellites, the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) in 1989{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}} and the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) in 2001{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}}.

 --&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |phenomena}}

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = J. A. | title = Classical physics as geometry | doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(57)90049-0 | journal = Ann. Phys. | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 525| year = 1957 | bibcode = 1957AnPhy...2..525M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the ''Schwarzschild wormhole''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dobrev&gt;Vladimir Dobrev (ed.), ''Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics: Varna, Bulgaria, June 2015'', Springer, 2016, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be present in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an ''eternal black hole'', but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A. Einstein and N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''48'''(73) (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="focus032505"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindley|first1=David|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|url=http://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|website=Physics|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=Mar 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Fuller and J. A. Wheeler, "Causality and Multiply-Connected Space-Time," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''128'''(919) (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Other non-traversable wormholes include ''Lorentzian wormholes'' (first proposed by John Archibald Wheeler in 1957), wormholes creating a [[spacetime foam]] in a general relativistic spacetime manifold depicted by a [[Lorentzian manifold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys.

Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faster-than-light travel ==
{{further|Faster-than-light}}
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|alt=Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA Digital art by Les Bossinas (Cortez III Service Corp.), 1998|thumb|Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for [[NASA]]]]

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
{{main|Time travel}}

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W.

Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 978-0-393-31276-8| title-link = Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with [[Joseph Polchinski]]'s proposal of an '''Everett phone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polchinski|first=Joseph |title=Weinberg's Nonlinear quantum Mechanics and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=397–400 |date=1991 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..397P|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397 |pmid=10043797}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]) in [[Steven Weinberg]]'s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Rodrigo, ''The Physics of Stargates: Parallel Universes, Time Travel, and the Enigma of Wormhole Physics'', Eridanus Press, 2010, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (k^2 + l^2)(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2m}{r}} dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (1 - \frac{2m}{r})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; = proper time, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 1)

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to
&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r - 2m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -4(u^2 + 2m)du^2 - (u^2 + 2m)^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + \frac{u^2}{u^2 + 2m} dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;

(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
