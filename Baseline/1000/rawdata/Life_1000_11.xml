== Biography ==
20syl, originally a [[graphic designer]], graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in [[Nantes Metropolis|Nantes Métropole]]. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in [[Rezé]].

In 1995, 20Syl and Cambia released their first [[mixtape]], ''Première Formule.'' Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of 20Syl, to form the group [[Hocus Pocus (group)|Hocus Pocus]], and released their first album as a trio, ''Seconde Formule'', in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called [[C2C (group)|C2C]] (Coups2Cross). C2C was the world champion [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]] team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two [[MC (hip hop)|MCs]] and a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] did not work on stage and went their separate ways; 20Syl continued his productions and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/11135-hocus-pocus/bio|title=Biographie de Hocus Pocus - Universal Music France|website=Universal Music France|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, 20syl worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label ''On &amp; On'' and released the maxi ''Sick'', which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album ''73 Touches'' (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to [[Miles Davis]] and [[Billie Holiday]]. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of ''Sick'' and six new titles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The album ''Place 54'', released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category "[[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album|Best Urban Contemporary Album]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

20syl published his first solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''Motifs,'' on the 9 June 2014; the site [http://Sourdoreille.net sourdoreille.net] considers this EP as "a real gem"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc/ |title=Le premier EP de 20syl est une pépite {{!}} Sourdoreille |deadurl=no |archivedate=14 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914053818/http://www.sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc |accessdate=4 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [http://wordplaymagazine.com/ wordplaymagazine.com] praises 20syl's style as "frankly remarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wordplaymagazine.com/2015/06/articles/reviews/20-syl-motifs-2/|title=20 Syl – Motifs 2|date=13 June 2015 |newspaper=Wordplay Magazine|language=en-US|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second EP, ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'', was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'' &lt;abbr&gt;20syl&lt;/abbr&gt; explains: "For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/20syl-j-ai-envie-de-tout-controler_1685660.html|title=20syl: "I want to control everything"|last=|first=|date=4 December 2016|newspaper=LExpress.fr|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 in [[Nantes]], 20syl presented the U, an interactive musical [[Rampe|skateboard ramp]] (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onandon-records.com/leU/|title=Le U rampe sonore {{!}} Rampe de skate Interactive et musicale|website=www.onandon-records.com|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://herrmuttlobby.com// herrmuttlobby.com] says regarding U "The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herrmuttlobby.com/|title=herrmuttlobby.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 [[Keynote (presentation software)|The Apple Keynote]] used a piece of 20syl to promote the functionality of [[Siri]] on the Apple Watch in their [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKotmAS-2Ac "Choose Colorfully"] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.applemusic.info/|title=AppleMusic.info - The definitive list of music used by Apple Inc. in commercials, keynote addresses, presentations, and other marketing materials.|website=www.applemusic.info|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, 20syl published a remix of the Pulpalicious song ''How I Feel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|title=Quand 20syl remixe Pulpalicious - TheWebTape|date=22 December 2015|newspaper=TheWebTape|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406103500/http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled ''Inertia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenroom.fr/88013-20syl-sort-un-nouveau-single-pour-la-bonne-cause/|title=20Syl sort un nouveau single pour la bonne cause - Greenroom|date=15 January 2016 |newspaper=Greenroom|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2016, he published a remix of the song ''Walk Walk'' by [[Yael Naim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.quai-baco.com/20syl-revisite-le-titre-walk-walk-de-yael-naim-24892/|title=20syl revisite le titre " Walk Walk " de Yael Naim|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he formed the group [[AllttA]] (A Little Lower Than The Angels) with the Californian rapper [[Mr. J. Medeiros]]. Their debut album, titled ''The Upper Hand'', was released on February 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mr20syl/photos/a.138869306156683.25026.101405206569760/1273193322724270|title=facebook.com/mr20syl|last=|first=|date=|website=facebook.com|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2wenty''' is an American [[Mixed media|mixed-media]] artist and [[photographer]] from [[Los Angeles]]. He is known for using light as the central theme in his work. 2wenty comes from a background in lighting television and film which gives him an intimate understanding of how light works. The sources of light he utilizes for his light paintings are handmade, as well as creating the LED paintings by hand. His works can be viewed both nationally and internationally in Los Angeles, [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and [[London, England|London]].

== Art career ==
 [[File:Facebook Cigarettes poster by 2wenty.png|thumb|right|Facebook Social Cigarettes poster by 2wenty, 2011]]
2wenty first emerged in 2011, when his ''Facebook Social Cigarettes'' posters started appearing in technology blogs all over the internet and on the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetartsf.com/interview/artist-interview-2wenty/|title=2Wenty  Street Art SF|work=Street Art SF|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posters featured a pack of cigarettes with the [[Facebook]] logo and a tag that read, "Social Cigarettes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|title='Social Cigarettes' Street Artist Admits Facebook Addiction|work=LAist|accessdate=29 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803150238/http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created over one hundred of the posters, comparing [[Facebook]] consumption with that of "cancer sticks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/facebook-street-art-2wenty-forbes-kashmir-hill_b26020|title=FishbowlLA|work=mediabistro.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2wenty also created three-dimensional versions of the posters, complete with a surgeon general warning, "[[Facebook]] may cause loss of time, poor work ethic, obesity, social disorder and possible interference of destiny. Use at your own risk."

2wenty has had multiple collaborations with fellow aritst, [[Gregory Siff]],  in addition to This Means Mar. In December 2013, 2wenty was invited by Mar to show and create one of his "signature" light paintings at his solo show 'I Crave Love',  which was held at Lab Art Gallery in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |title=I Crave Love: A Solo Show At Lab Art LA, Shop Hex Blog, December 2013 |access-date=2015-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130424/http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labartgallery.com/blog/2011/12/21/this-means-mar/ This Means Mar]&lt;/ref&gt;

2wenty expands his oeuvre into [[Light painting|light painting photography]]. Through long exposures, the camera captures not only the subject, but also the source of light the artist moves across his "canvas". Within these detailed images," There is a depth and other worldliness that records both place and passage of time", says 2wenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaklandartmurmur.org/events/between-paint-and-light-2wenty-and-gregory-siff-at-loakal-2013-06-01/|title=Between Paint and Light: 2wenty and Gregory Siff at Loakal|work=oaklandartmurmur.org|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leveledmag.com/2012/09/light-drawing-photography-by-2wenty/ Light Drawing Photography by 2wenty]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selwyn Bougard''', now known as '''El-Divine Amir Bey''', better known by his stage name '''4th Disciple''', is a sonic artist and audio engineer who was one of the founding members of [[Killarmy]] and one of the best-known [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang-affiliated producers]]. He is the only member of the Wu Elements to have worked on the Clan's first breakthrough album, as a mixer.

== Biography ==
After being a turntablist on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', 4th Disciple co-produced and helped mix several tracks with the [[RZA]] on the first three Wu-Tang solo ventures by various artists, including co-production for "Sub Crazy" by [[Method Man]], "Damage" by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as well as mixing credits for some of [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', on the tracks "Criminology," "Guillotine (Swordz)," "Spot Rusherz," and "Wu-Gambinos." 4th Disciple then produced what was at the time only the second Wu-Tang track ever to lack a RZA production credit, when the [[Killah Priest]] solo track "B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)" was included on [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. This led to five 4th Disciple productions appearing on the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.

After producing 15 of the 17 tracks on Killarmy's debut album, ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]'', and contributing significant production to the debut albums of [[Killah Priest]] (''[[Heavy Mental]]'') and [[Sunz of Man]] (''[[The Last Shall Be First (Sunz of Man album)|The Last Shall be First]]''), 4th Disciple's beats continued to appear on the solo work of the Clan members, including Inspectah Deck and Method Man. However, more recently, 4th Disciple has been concentrating his production on Killarmy, Sunz of Man, and their immediate affiliates rather than the Clan itself. [[The RZA]] did, in fact, produce the tracks "Wake Up" and "War Face" from ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]''

'''Alfred Poling''' (born January 22, 1957) better known by the [[ring name]] '''911''', is an American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for his time with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) between 1994 and 1996.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
Poling was trained as a wrestler by [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler) | Larry Sharpe]]. He debuted in 1990, wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] under the [[ring name]] "Al the Sledgehammer".&lt;ref name="iwatapings1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1softball.com/WBS/WrestlingBookingSheet291.htm |title=The Wrestling Booking Sheet - Issue #291 |first=Steve |last=Appenrodt |date=1999-08-30 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ytiwasledgehammer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7gHi_sgkAw |title=IWA Championship Wrestling - Derrick Dukes vs Al The Sledgehammer |first=Rob |last=Russen |year=1990 |accessdate=2013-08-30|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994-1996)===
Poling achieved his greatest national exposure in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Werstling]] (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed "handler" to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] on the January 18, 1994 episode of ''[[ECW Hardcore TV|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'' by defeating [[Chad Slivenski|Chad Austin]]. He joined [[Paul Heyman]]'s [[Dangerous Alliance]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]] with Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. His [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was as an enforcer of the "extreme" attitude; he was named '''911''' at ''The Night The Line was Crossed'' on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the [[chokeslam]] on others with little provocation, which made him quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#over|popular]] with the crowd as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/24/pf-729421.html|title=SLAM! Speaks: What we miss about ECW|author=SLAM Wrestling staff|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2015|date=November 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first title shot in ECW at ''When Worlds Collide'', where he challenged [[Mikey Whipwreck]] for the [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW Television Championship]] but got disqualified after chokeslamming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]].  He would then enter a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]], whom he defeated at [[Hardcore Heaven (1994)|Hardcore Heaven]]. On August 27, at the [[NWA World Title Tournament]], 911 participated in the [[ECW tournaments#NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tournament|namesake tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he defeated [[Doink the Clown]] in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed the year by defeating [[The Pitbulls]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] at [[Holiday Hell (1994)|Holiday Hell]]. Poling received the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[PWI Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.

Poling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] and [[Jim Steele (wrestler)|Jim Steele]] at ''Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams''. At the [[House Party (1996)|1996 House Party]] [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|event]], 911 teamed with [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat [[The Eliminators]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]], which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with [[Tazz|Taz]] after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===World Championship Wrestling (1996-1997)===
Poling wrestled in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone,&lt;ref name="nt19961223"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Monday Nitro|series= WCW Monday Nitro|serieslink= WCW Monday Nitro|station= TNT (TV channel)|airdate= 1996-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sledge Hammer&lt;ref name="sn19970215"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Big Al.&lt;ref name="sn19970111"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970412"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970510"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with [[Tank Abbott]] in WCW in early 2000.

===Return to ECW===
In 1998, Poling returned to ECW at [[UltraClash (1998)|UltraClash]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, [[chokeslam]]ming [[Bill Wiles]]. Poling was then accompanied by manager Judge Jeff Jones, who proclaimed 911 to be the true giant of professional wrestling. They were then interrupted by [[Spike Dudley]] and had an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#impromptu match|impromptu match]], which 911 lost in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|under a minute]].

===Independent circuit===
Throughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the [[New Jersey]] based [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] promotion, winning the [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship]] on two occasions. He made an appearance at [[Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling]] ''A War Renewed'' on June 29th, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of [[Tod Gordon]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], delivering a chokeslam to [[Sandman (wrestler)|Sandman]] (who had just been betrayed by his partner, [[Bill Alfonso]]). At ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'' in 2005 he chokeslammed both [[Danny Doring]] and [[Roadkill (wrestler)|Roadkill]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008.

'''Artificial Life''' is a free and [[Open-source software|open source]]d [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Software framework|framework]] created to simulate [[Life]]. It is a multi-agents framework where each agent runs its own Thread.

The agents are split into two different categories: the services and the processes. The services deliver services to other agents and the processes execute specific tasks.

The agents are organized in a [[tree structure]] called Instance. Within an Instance, the services and the processes are grouped together and unlimited groups can be defined. Each node of the Instance tree can have a collection of views used to monitor the activity of the node or interact with the node. The definition of Java classes used within the Instance (i.e. processes, services or views) is defined in the Instance Model.

In order to avoid dead locking, [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]] implements a messaging system, a method invocation mechanism based on the messaging system and an event mechanism also based on the messaging system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13219">'''Autogamy''', or '''self-fertilization''', refers to the [[Cell fusion|fusion]] of two [[gamete]]s that come from one individual.  Autogamy is predominantly observed in the form of self-pollination, a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants.  However, species of [[protist]]s have also been observed using autogamy as a means of reproduction.  Flowering plants engage in autogamy regularly, while the protists that engage in autogamy only do so in stressful environments.

==Occurrence==

===Protists===
====Paramecium aurelia====
''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' is the most commonly studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, ''Paramecium aurelia'' typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization.  However, studies have shown that when put under nutritional stress, ''Paramecium aurelia'' will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, James D. "Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis." Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475-485.
&lt;/ref&gt; This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps.  First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei.  Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism.  The other two daughter nuclei become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, W. F. (1936), Nuclear reorganization processes in Paramecium aurelia, with descriptions of autogamy and ‘hemixis’. J. Morphol., 59: 11–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress.  Research shows that ''Paramecium aurelia'' undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species.

====Clonal aging and rejuvenation====

In ''[[Paramecium]] tetraurelia'', vitality declines over the course of successive asexual cell divisions by binary fission. Clonal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid424739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith-Sonneborn J |title=DNA repair and longevity assurance in Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Science |volume=203 |issue=4385 |pages=1115–7 |year=1979 |pmid=424739 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3091993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes GE, Holmes NR |title=Accumulation of DNA damages in aging Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Mol. Gen. Genet. |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=108–14 |year=1986 |pmid=3091993 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8127914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilley D, Blackburn EH |title=Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1955–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8127914 |pmc=43283 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When paramecia that have experienced clonal aging undergo [[meiosis]], either during conjugation or automixis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear [[DNA]] that had just experienced meiosis followed by syngamy.  These paramecia are rejuvenated in the sense of having a restored clonal lifespan.  Thus it appears that clonal aging is due in large part to the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, and that rejuvenation is due to [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] during meiosis that occurs in the micronucleus during conjugation or automixis and reestablishment of the macronucleus by replication of the newly repaired micronuclear DNA.

====Tetrahymena rostrata====
Similar to Paramecium aurelia, the parasitic [[ciliate]] ''Tetrahymena rostrata'' has also been shown to engage in meiosis, autogamy and development of new macronuclei when placed under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczanowski, Andrzej. "Cohesion of Clonal Life History, Senescence and Rejuvenation Induced by Autogamy of the Histophagous Ciliate Tetrahymena Rostrata." Protist 167.5 (2016): n. pag. PubMed. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the degeneration and remodeling of genetic information that occurs in autogamy, genetic variability arises and possibly increases an offspring’s chances of survival in stressful environments.

====Allogromia laticollaris====
''[[Allogromia laticollaris]]'' is perhaps the best-studied [[Foraminifera|foraminiferan amoeboid]] for autogamy. ''Allogromia laticollaris'' can alternate between sexual reproduction via cross-fertilization and asexual reproduction via binary fission. The details of the life cycle of Allogromia laticollaris are unknown, but similar to ''Paramecium aurelia'', ''Allogromia laticollaris'' is also shown to sometimes defer to autogamous behavior when placed in nutritional stress. As seen in Paramecium, there is some nuclear dimorphism observed in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  There are often observations of [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and chromosomal fragments coexisting in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  This is indicative of nuclear and chromosomal degeneration, a process similar to the subdivisions observed in ''Paramecium aurelia.'' Multiple generations of [[Ploidy|haploid]] ''Allogromia laticollaris'' individuals can exist before autogamy actually takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. J. and McEnery, M. E. (1970), Autogamy in Allogromia laticollaris (Foraminifera). The Journal of Protozoology, 17: 184–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The autogamous behavior in Allogromia laticollaris has the added consequence of giving rise to daughter cells that are substantially smaller than those rising from binary fission.&lt;ref&gt;K., Sen Gupta B. Modern Foraminifera. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that this is a survival mechanism employed when the cell is in stressful environments, and thus not able to allocate all resources to creating offspring.  If a cell was under nutritional stress and not able to function regularly, there would be a strong possibility of its offspring’s fitness being sub-par.

===Self-pollination in flowering plants===
Self-pollination is an example of autogamy that occurs in flowering plants.  Self-pollination occurs when the sperm in the pollen from the stamen of a plant goes to the carpels of that same plant and fertilizes the egg cell present. Self-pollination can either be done completely autogamously or geitonogamously.  In the former, the egg and sperm cells that united came from the same flower.  In the latter, the sperm and egg cells can come from a different flower on the same plant.  While the latter method does blur the lines between autogamous self-fertilization and normal sexual reproduction, it is still considered autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-pollination]] can lead to [[inbreeding depression]] due to expression of deleterious recessive [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meiosis followed by self-pollination results in little genetic variation, raising the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over an extended period in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. For instance, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-pollinating plant that has an outcrossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Abbott RJ, Gomes MF.  Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Heredity 1989 62:411-418&lt;/ref&gt; and self-pollination appears to have evolved roughly a million years ago or more.&lt;ref name="pmid17656687"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang C, Toomajian C, Sherman-Broyles S, Plagnol V, Guo YL, Hu TT, Clark RM, Nasrallah JB, Weigel D, Nordborg M |title=The evolution of selfing in Arabidopsis thaliana |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5841 |pages=1070–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17656687 |doi=10.1126/science.1143153 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptive benefit of meiosis that may explain its long-term maintenance in self-pollinating plants is efficient [[genetic recombination|recombination]]al repair of DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid3324702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Adv. Genet. |volume=24 |issue= |pages=323–70 |year=1987 |pmid=3324702 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein and Richard E. Michod (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19 in DNA Repair. Inna Kruman editor. InTech Open Publisher. doi:10.5772/25117 http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of autogamy==
	There are several advantages for the self-fertilization observed in flowering plants and protists.  In flowering plants, it is important for some plants not to be dependent on pollinating agents that other plants rely on for fertilization. This is unusual, however, considering that many plant species have evolved to become incompatible with their own gametes.  While these species would not be well served by having autogamous self-fertilization as a reproductive mechanism, other species, which do not have self-incompatibility, would benefit from autogamy.  Protists have the advantage of diversifying their modes of reproduction. This is useful for a multitude of reasons. First, if there is an unfavorable change in the environment that puts the ability to deliver offspring at risk, then it is advantageous for an organism to have autogamy at its disposal. In other organisms, it is seen that genetic diversity arising from sexual reproduction is maintained by changes in the environment that favor certain genotypes over others.
Aside from extreme circumstances, it is possible that this form of reproduction gives rise to a genotype in the offspring that will increase fitness in the environment.  This is due to the nature of the genetic degeneration and remodeling intrinsic to autogamy in unicellular organisms.  Thus, autogamous behavior may become advantageous to have if an individual wanted to ensure offspring viability and survival. This advantage also applies to flowering plants.  However, it is important to note that this change has not shown to produce a progeny with more fitness in unicellular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G., and Christopher R. Herlihy. "Using a Cost-benefit Approach to Understand the Evolution of Self-fertilization in Plants: The Perplexing Case of Aquilegia Canadensis (Ranunculaceae)." Plant Species Biology 19.3 (2004): 159-73. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the nutrition deprived state of the parent cells before autogamy created a barrier for producing offspring that could thrive in those same stressful environments.

==Disadvantages of autogamy==
	In flowering plants, autogamy has the disadvantage of producing low genetic diversity in the species that use it as the predominant mode of reproduction. This leaves those species particularly susceptible to pathogens and viruses that can harm it. In addition, the foraminiferans that use autogamy have shown to produce substantially smaller progeny as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that since it is generally an emergency survival mechanism for unicellular species, the mechanism does not have the nutritional resources that would be provided by the organism if it were undergoing binary fission.

==Evolution of autogamy==
	The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in plants.  About 10-15% of [[flowering plant]]s are predominantly self-fertilizing.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright SI, Kalisz S, Slotte T |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since autogamy in flowering plants and autogamy in unicellular species is fundamentally different, and plants and protists are not related, it is likely that both instances evolved separately.  In flowering plants, it is believed that autogamy evolved one million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Chunlao, Tang. "The Evolution of Selfing in Arabidopsis Thaliana." Science317.5841 (2007): 1070--72. AAAS. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the little overall genetic variation that arises in progeny, it is not fully understood how autogamy has been maintained in the tree of life.

The '''''Baopuzi''''' ({{zh|s=抱朴子|t=抱朴子|p=Bàopǔzǐ|w=Pao-p'u-tzu|l=[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity}}), written by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]] 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric ''Neipian'' 內篇 "Inner Chapters" and exoteric ''Waipian'' 外篇 "Outer Chapters". The [[Daoist]] Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], elixirs, and demonology. The [[Confucianist]] Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese literature]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], politics, and society.

==Title==
The [[eponymous]] title ''Baopuzi'' derives from Ge Hong's [[Art name|''hao'']] 號 "sobriquet; pseudonym" Baopuzi (lit. "embrace simplicity master"), which compounds ''bao'' [[Wikt:抱|抱]] "embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' or [[Wikt:朴|朴]] "uncarved wood, [a [[Taoism#Pu|Daoist metaphor]] for a] person's original nature; simple; plain", and ''zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; offspring; master [title of respect]". ''Baopu'' is a classical allusion to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), "Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries."

Ge Hong's autobiography explains choosing his [[pen name]] Baopuzi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (''Pao-p'u''), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) "people all call me a ''pao-p'u'' scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)"; (Sailey 1978:251) "among the people of his district there were those who called him "The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity"."  Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, "This name has been translated ''Old Sober-Sides'', but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated ''Solemn-Seeming Philosopher''." Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates "Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature".

==History==
Compared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the ''Baopuzi'' are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]] founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).

Ge Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the ''Baopuzi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed ''Nei p'ien'' in 20 scrolls, ''Wai p'ien'' in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My ''Nei p'ien'', telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My ''Wai p'ien'', giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), "I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready."

Ge's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), [[Emperor Cheng of Jin]] granted Ge the fief of "Marquis of [[Guanzhong]]" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the ''Baopuzi'' during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).

The ''Baopuzi'' consists of 70 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters; books" divided between the 20 "Inner Chapters" and 50 "Outer Chapters" (cf. the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' textual division). [[Nathan Sivin]] (1969:389) described it as "not one book but two, considerably different in theme". The ''Neipian'' and ''Waipian'' "led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time".

The (1444–1445) [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist canon" first printed the two ''Baopuzi'' parts together. This ''Zhengtong Daozang'' 正統道藏 "Daoist Canon of the [[Zhengtong Emperor|Zhengtong]] Era (1436-1450)" bibliographically categorized the ''Baopuzi'' under the ''Taiqing'' 太清 "Supreme Clarity" section for alchemical texts. ''Daozang'' editions encompass six ''juan'' (卷 "scrolls; fascicles; volumes"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of ''Baopuzi'' descend from this Ming ''Daozang'' text.

==Content==
The ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from [[esotericism]] to [[social philosophy]]. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], meditation, [[Daoist yoga]], [[Daoyin]], [[Taoist sexual practices|sexual techniques]], [[Chinese herbology]], demons, and [[Fulu|''fu'']] 符 "magic talismans". The Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called "the fullest document of this kind that early China produced".

According to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the ''ben'' 本 "root; trunk; origin" and Confucianism as the ''mo'' 末 "tip; branch; end" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, "Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?" – Baopuzi replies, "Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism."

While the ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is ''Huowen yue'' 或問曰 "Someone asked, saying" and ''Baopuzi da yue'' 抱樸子答曰 "Baopuzi answered, saying".

===Inner Chapters===
The twenty ''Neipian'' "Inner Chapters" record arcane techniques for achieving ''xian'' "transcendence; immortality". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars later differentiated into ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir; internal alchemy" and ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir; external alchemy". The word ''dan'' [[Wikt:丹|丹]] "[[cinnabar]]; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill" means  "[[Pill of Immortality|pill of immortality]], or [[elixir of life]]. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. "Internal alchemy" concerns creating an "immortal body" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). "External" or "laboratory alchemy" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing ''fu'' talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.

Lai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) proofs of the ''per se'' existence of immortals and transcendent states of immortality of the body; (2) stipulation of the accessibility to the perfect state of long life to everyone, irrespective of one's social status but dependent on whether one could study deeply and strenuously cultivate the necessary esoteric methods; (3) elaboration of diverse esoteric techniques leading one to become a ''hsien''-immortal; and (4) descriptions and criticism of the diverse contemporary Taoist discourses and sects. (1998:191-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).

Many scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:437), who called Ge Hong "the greatest alchemist in Chinese history", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Interlocutor'': Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. &lt;br&gt;
''Ko'': According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, "Admittedly there is much in the ''Pao Phu Tzu'' which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce."

In addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention  the ''Baopuzi'' formula for making [[mosaic gold]] "a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment" from ''chiyan'' 赤塩 "red crystal salt" (produced from [[amethyst]], [[calcite]] [[crystal]], and [[alum]]; Ware 1966:273) and ''huizhi'' 灰汁 "[[limewater]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or "mosaic gold" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of ''Ch'ih Yen'' (Red Salt) and ''Huei Chih'' (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of ''Ch'ih Yen''." They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). "All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." (1935:232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors add, "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make [[tin foil]] and that he made magic or spirit money out of it."

===Outer Chapters===
The fifty ''Waipian'' "Outer Chapters" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This ''Baopuzi'' portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of [[Luoyang]].

Some of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the ''[[Qingtan]]'' "pure conversation" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of [[Cao Cao]]; and [[Pao Ching-yen|Bao Jingyan]] 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.

==Translations==
The Chinese ''Baopuzi'' has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.

The Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the [[history of alchemy]]. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 "On the Gold Medicine" and 16 "On the Yellow and White" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 "Overcoming Obstructions" and 11 "On ''hsien'' Medicines", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).

The Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). "Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion."

Translating the fundamental Daoist word ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' or ''Tao'' "way; path; principle" as English ''[[God]]'' is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's ''Baopuzi'' version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of ''[[Daodejing]]'' 25, "Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet ''Tao'' (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, upon noticing that ''Tao Te Ching'', verse 34, is willing to call the Something "Minimal," every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by ''God''. In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from ''Exod''. 3:13-15 and ''Mark'' 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, "My name is I am, I live, I exist," while the second reads, "God is not of the dead but of the living." Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware admitted his ''God'' for ''Dao'' translation cannot be applied consistently.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the word ''tao'' appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as "the divine process." In instances where either this or "God" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term ''tao shih'' is rendered "processor"; ''hsien'' is translated "genie" rather than "immortal". (1966:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These Chinese words are ''daoshi'' [[Wikt:道士|道士]] "Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner" and [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] [[Wikt:仙|仙]] "immortal; transcendent". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the [[History of science and technology in China]], criticized Ware's mistranslations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that "Genii," as used for rendering the word ''hsien'', does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the ''Thousand-and-One Nights''. The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. ''Tao'' left untranslated and "immortal" for ''hsien''. (1967:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. "Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China."

Ge Hong wrote the ''Baopuzi'' in elegant [[Classical Chinese grammar]] and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing ''xian'' medicines illustrates the translational choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best ''hsien'' medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, ''chih'', the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, ''t'ai i yü yü liang'', ''shih chung huang tzu'' 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), ''shih kuei'' 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, ''shih nao'' 石腦, ''shih liu huang'' 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and ''tseng ch'ing''. (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many ''chih'', then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then ''ming-chu'', then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baoppuzi'' Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on "Buddhism and the ''Pao-p'u-tzu''", "Biography of Ko Hung" from the ''[[Jin Shu]]'', and "Recensions" of lost ''Baopuzi'' fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, "Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture."

==Significance==
For centuries, traditional scholars have revered the ''Baopuzi'' as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.

Traditional scholarship viewed the ''Baopuzi'', especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Wu and Davis described it as, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;probably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Arthur Waley]] praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 "metal-lord" and 河車 "river chariot", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 "the virgin on the river", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the ''Baopuzi'' is a "more important" alchemical text than [[Wei Boyang]]'s (ca. 142) ''[[Cantong qi]]'' 參同契 "The Kinship of the Three". The ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Neijing'' 內經 "Inner Classic" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's ''Cantong ji''.

Modern scholarship has taken another look at the ''Baopuzi''. Sivin demeans the text's significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what "fundamentalist Confucian" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, "an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector", with [[Alan Watts]]. "Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time."  However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, "This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate."

Chi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a "new discourse" on ''xian''-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional "imperial discourse" that only the rich could afford ''xian''-hood. For example, histories record that both [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the "elixir of immortality" from mythical [[Mount Penglai]]. "That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful."
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Ko Hung, the ''hsien''-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that ''hsien''-immortality are distinctive "human" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of ''hsien''-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, "Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power."' Second, in placing the ideal of ''hsien''-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were "models" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, "These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao." (Lai 1998:210) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces ''daoshi'' "Daoist practitioners" seeking ''xian'' techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I asked further, "Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes."

Said Cheng Chun in reply, "The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But ''Tao-shih'' are all poor; witness the adage that ''Hsien'' are never stout and ''Tao-shih'' never rich. ''Tao-shih'' usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware (1966:268) translates this adage, "There are no fat genii and no rich processors".

For a wealthy person seeking ''xian''-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding ''jinye'' 金液 (lit. "gold liquid/fluid") "golden liquor" in a ''huachi'' 花池 (lit. "flower pond") "a vinegar solvent" (fortified with [[saltpeter]]; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional ''jiuding'' 九鼎 "nine tripods" elixirs (attributed to the [[Yellow Emperor]]), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;True it is that the nine medicines are the best of ''Hsien'' medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a ''Hua Ch'ih'' (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into ''Hsien''. Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:251) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pregadio (2006:215) says recent studies show Ge's intent was "glorifying the religious and ritual legacy of [[Jiangnan]] 江南 (the region south of the lower Yangzi River), emphasizing the superiority of certain traditions over others, and enhancing their prestige among the social elite to which Ge Hong belonged." Nonetheless, Pregadio concludes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Ge Hong's testimony deserves attention as a valuable overview of the religious traditions of Jiangnan just before the Way of the Celestial Masters ([[Tianshi dao]]) spread to that area, soon followed by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] revelations. From this point of view, the ''Baopu zi'' documents important links between the earlier and later history of Taoism, as it also does for medicine and other fields. (2006:217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[air traffic control]] traffic is normally separated by elevation, with east bound flights at odd thousand feet elevations and west bound flights at even thousand feet elevations (1000&amp;nbsp;ft ≈ 305m). Above 28,000&amp;nbsp;ft (~8.5&amp;nbsp;km) only odd flight levels are used, with FL 290, 330, 370, etc., for eastbound flights and FL 310, 350, 390, etc., for westbound flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/nav/airways.htm airways and aircraft separation]&lt;/ref&gt; Entry to and exit from airports is always one-way traffic, as runways are chosen to allow aircraft to take off and land into the wind, to reduce ground speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/move.html Relative Velocity]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in no wind cases, a preferred calm wind runway and direction is normally chosen and used by all flights, to avoid collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/aero/avoffice/press/pdf/minnflyer606.pdf |title=Calm Wind Runways |access-date=2012-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617012601/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/aero/avoffice/press/pdf/minnflyer606.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In uncontrolled airports, airport information can be obtained from anyone at the airport. Traffic follows a specific traffic pattern, with designated entry and exits. Radio announcements are made, whether anyone is listening or not, to allow any other traffic to be aware of other traffic in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/sa08.pdf Operations at nontowered airports]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest days of railways in the [[United Kingdom]], most lines were built [[double track]]ed because of the difficulty of coordinating operations in pre-[[telegraphy]] times.

Most modern roads carry bidirectional traffic, although [[one-way traffic]] is common in dense urban centres.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Bidirectional traffic flow is believed to influence the rate of [[traffic collision]]s. In an analysis of [[head-on collision]]s, [[rear-end collision]]s, and lane-changing collisions based on the Simon-Gutowitz bidirectional traffic model, it was concluded that "the risk of collisions is important when the density of cars in one lane is small and that of the other lane is high enough", and that "heavy vehicles cause an important reduction of traffic flow on the home lane and provoke an increase of the risk of car accident".&lt;ref name="Moussa 2009-05-26"&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Najem | last=Moussa| title=Simulation study of traffic accidents in bidirectional traffic models| year=2009 |arxiv=0905.4252| doi=10.1142/S0129183110016007| volume=21| journal=International Journal of Modern Physics C| pages=1501–1515| bibcode=2010IJMPC..21.1501M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boids''' is an [[artificial life]] program, developed by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, which simulates the [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour of [[Bird|birds]]. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGGRAPH]] conference. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=Rule separation.gif|caption1=Separation|image2=Rule alignment.gif|caption2=Alignment|image3=Rule cohesion.gif|caption3=Cohesion|footer=Rules applied in simple Boids}}
As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of [[emergence|emergent]] behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules.  The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* '''separation''': [[wikt:steer#Verb 2|steer]] to avoid crowding local flockmates
* '''alignment''': steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* '''cohesion''': steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et&amp;nbsp;al.&lt;ref&gt;

extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes&lt;ref&gt;

introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the boid to become a leader and try to escape.

The movement of Boids can be characterized as either chaotic (splitting groups and wild behaviour) or orderly. Unexpected behaviours, such as splitting flocks and reuniting after avoiding obstacles, can be considered emergent.

The boids framework is often used in computer graphics, providing realistic-looking representations of flocks of birds and other creatures, such as schools of fish or herds of animals. It was for instance used in the 1998 video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' for the flying bird-like creatures seen at the end of the game on [[Locations of Half-Life#Xen|Xen]], named "boid" in the game files.

The Boids model can be used for direct control and stabilization of teams of simple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5980123&amp;isnumber=5979525 |title= Design and analysis of Group Escape Behavior for distributed autonomous mobile robots  |first1= Hongkyu |last1= Min  |first2= Zhidong |last2= Wang |year= 2011 |conference= IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Swarms of micro aerial vehicles stabilized under a visual relative localization  |first1= Martin |last1= Saska |first2= Vakula |last2= Jan |first3= Preucil |last3= Libor |year= 2014 |conference= IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[swarm robotics]]. For stabilization of heterogeneous UAV-UGV teams, the model was adapted for using onboard relative localization by Saska et&amp;nbsp;al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Coordination and Navigation of Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Teams Localized by a Hawk-Eye Approach  |first1= Martin |last1= Saska |first2= Vonasek |last2= Vojtech |first3= Krajnik |last3= Tomas |first4= Preucil |last4= Libor |year= 2012 |conference= IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of proposal, Reynolds' approach represented a giant step forward compared to the traditional techniques used in computer animation for motion pictures. The first animation created with the model was ''[[Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice]]'' (1987), followed by a feature film debut in [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) with computer generated bat swarms and armies of penguins marching through the streets of Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lrss.fri.uni-lj.si/people/ilbajec/papers/ilb_ab09.pdf | last1=Lebar Bajec |first1= Iztok |first2=  Frank H. |last2= Heppner | date=2009 | title=Organized flight in birds | work=Animal Behaviour | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 777–789 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own.

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 85 | issue = 22| pages = 8583–8587 | pmid = 3186749 | pmc = 282503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 283–290 | pmid = 1033982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;Chimera Mouse production by blastocyst injection, Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = M | last2 = Hadjantonakis | first2 = AK | last3 = Nagy | first3 = A | title = Aggregation chimeras.

===Structure===
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal '''plant chimeras''' are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5LwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;dq=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38m0Tee4O8ns0gHR0JGWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' The plastids: their chemistry, structure, growth and inheritance''], 2nd edition,1978, Elsevier/ North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-80022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0JLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Mutation+breeding+techniques+and+behavior+of+irradiated+shoot+apices+of+potato&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=18q0TYacDajg0gGp9b31CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' Mutation breeding techniques and behavior of irradiated shoot apices of potato''], 1978, Pudoc, Wageingen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft chimeras===
{{Main|Graft-chimaera}}
[[File:Taxus-mosaic1.JPG|thumb| [[Taxus]] mosaic.]]
These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different [[cultivar]]s or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

[[File:Red_and_blue_pill.jpg|thumb|In the film ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo is offered the option of consuming either [[Red pill and blue pill|the red pill or the blue pill]]. Picking the red pill would result in the truth of Neo's world being revealed to him, while picking the blue pill would allow him to continue in [[ignorance]]. Thus, Neo must judge the merits of the possible outcomes of his choice.]]

'''Choice''' involves [[decision making]]. It can include [[judging]] the merits of multiple [[wikt:option|option]]s and [[wikt:select|select]]ing one or more of them. One can make a choice between imagined options ("What would I do if...?") or between real options followed by the corresponding action. For example, a traveller might choose a route for a journey based on the [[preference]] of arriving at a given destination as soon as possible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then follow from information such as the length of each of the possible routes, traffic conditions, etc.  The arrival at a choice can include more complex motivators such as [[cognition]], [[instinct]], and [[feeling]].

Simple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's [[personal life|life]] overall.  More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;&lt;ref&gt;
Barry Schwartz: ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause [[psychological]] problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Types==
There are four main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. [[Brian Tracy]] breaks them down into:&lt;ref&gt;''Time Power'', Brian Tracy, 2007, pg. 153 {{ISBN|0-8144-7470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the "Commander in Chief"; or owner of a company.
# Delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone, such as the [[color of the bike shed]], and should be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# Avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# "No-brainer" decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, or fourth if avoided and "no-brainer" decisions are combined as one type, is the [[collaborative]] decision, which should be made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the [[Pilot in command|captain]] when a lesser crew member becomes aware of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.fly.faa.gov/|title=CDM CDM - Collaborative Decision Making|author=|date=|website=cdm.fly.faa.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used, is the decision:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/types-of-decision-making.html|title=Types of decision making - an overview|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition based
* Combination

Recognizing that "type" is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types_of_decision_making.html|title=Types of Decision Making|work=decision-making-solutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business 
* Personal
* Consumer

In this approach, establishing the types of choices makes it possible to identify the related decisions that will influence and constrain a specific choice as well as be influenced and constrained by another choice.

There are many "executive decision maker" products available, such as the decision wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/decision-wheels.html|title=A variety of decision wheels!|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which randomly produce yes/no or other "decisions" for someone who cannot make up their mind or just wants to delegate.

A [[ouija]] board is also a delegated decision.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethical leadership in schools'', Kenneth A. Strike, 2006, pg. 5 {{ISBN|1-4129-1351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates]] cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/02/pentagon_report.html|title=Pentagon ends photo ban on war dead return|author=|date=|website=boston.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option's attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of ''evaluability'', that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, [[George Loewenstein]], Blount &amp; Bazerman (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Hsee, C.K., Loewenstein, G.F., Blount, S., Bazerman, M.H. (1999). Preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations of option: A review and theoretical analysis. Psychological Bulletin 125(5), 576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

Personal factors determine food choice. They are [[preference]], [[association (psychology)|associations]], [[habit (psychology)|habits]], [[ethnic heritage]], [[tradition]], [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social pressure]], [[emotion|emotional comfort]], [[availability]], [[convenience]], [[economy]], [[image]], [[medical conditions]], and [[nutrition]].

==Number of options and paradox==
A number of research studies in economic psychology have focused on how individual behavior differs when the choice set size (the number of choices to choose from) is low versus when it is high. Of particular interest is whether individuals are more likely to purchase a product from a large versus a small choice set. Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar and Lepper.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Norwood, Lusk, Arunachalam, and Henneberry.&lt;/ref&gt; One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. M., &amp; Hoffrage, U. (2009). Testing the tyranny of too much choice against the allure of more choice. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 26(3), 280-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person's welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D. D., DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Chok, J., &amp; Brozyna, G. A. (2011). The 'tyranny of choice': Choice overload as a possible instance of effort discounting. The Psychological Record, 61(4), 547-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood&lt;/ref&gt; The other assumes that individuals can experience [[regret (emotion)|regret]] if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.&lt;ref&gt;Irons and Hepburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research has expanded on [[choice overload]], suggesting that there is a [[paradox of choice]]. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people’s standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice “spoils you.” Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2000). Self-determination: The tyranny of freedom. American Psychologist, 55(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question (Scheibehenne, Greigeneder, and Todd, 2010). In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people's beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of "too many options" is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one’s options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one’s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Daniel T., Ebert, Jane E. J. (2002). Decisions and revisions: The affective forecasting of changeable outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 82(4). 503-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.&lt;ref&gt;Bullens, L., van Harreveld, F., &amp; Förster, J. (2011). Keeping one's options open: The detrimental consequences of decision reversibility. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 800-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisficer-maximizer spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisficers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one’s choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisficers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, E. A., Ehrlinger, J., &amp; Eibach, R. P. (2012). Failing to commit: Maximizers avoid commitment in a way that contributes to reduced satisfaction. Personality And Individual Differences, 52(1), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that maximizers reported significantly less [[life satisfaction]], happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisficers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Ward, A., Monterosso, J., Lyubomirsky, S., White, K., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (2002). Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5) 1178-97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others{{Who|date=May 2013}} say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn't the ''best decision'' he will continually try to ''incrementally improve'' the decisions he takes).

[[Choice architecture]] is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose.  Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sheena Iyengar |title=The Art of Choosing |publisher=Twelve |location= |year=2010 |pages=208–213 |isbn=0-446-50410-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to identity==
[[File:Headresser.jpg|thumb|Choosing a hairstyle.]]
Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one's concept of [[self-identity]] or values.  In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person's self-concept.  Purely functional items, such as a [[fire extinguisher]], may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person's concept of self-identity or associated values.&lt;ref&gt;

{{For|the 1843 short story|Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent}}
{{Other uses|Egoist (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
'''Egotism''' is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Kowalski ed., ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'' (1997) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;William Walker Atkinson, ''The New Psychology'' (2010 [1909]) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those "loved" or considered as "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or [[narcissism]] – indeed some would say "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Schmalhausen, ''Why We Misbehave'' (2004 [1928]) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves  in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a [[grandiose]] sense of their own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 1114&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Leary, ''The Curse of the Self'' (OUP 2007) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to [[narcissistic rage]] at a sense of insult.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Egotism differs from both [[altruism]] – or acting to gain ''fewer'' values than are being given – and from [[egoism]], the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of "empirical egoism" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general –  necessitate having an inflated sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. C. Flügel]], ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1973) p. 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]], ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The over-evaluation of one's own ego&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] to the best of their own  knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]] and [[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner &amp; Cleese, ''Families'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Skynner]] however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where "your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner and John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing ''individual'' egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly and M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley, ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' (Penguin 1977) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Romanticism]] had already set in motion a countervailing current, what [[Richard Eldridge]] described as a kind of "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eldridge, ''The Persistence of Romanticism'' (2001) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 563–4&lt;/ref&gt; – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. [[Keats]] might still attack [[Wordsworth]] for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hart, ''Robert Lowell and the Sublime'' (1995) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the [[Me generation]] into the [[Culture of Narcissism]].

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 565-6&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest,  as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sex==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. [[Sigmund Freud]] popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; giving him or her a new sense of  humility in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 516-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek ("εγώ") and subsequently its Latinised ego (''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]''), meaning "self" or "I," and ''[[-ism]]'', used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with [[wikt:egoism|egoism]].

==Cultural examples==
* [[A. A. Milne]] has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thwaite, ''A. A. Milne: His Life'' (2006) p. 123 and p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ryan Holiday]] described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ego Is The Enemy|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780698192157|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Framsticks''' is a 3D freeware [[Artificial Life]] simulator.  Organisms consisting of physical structures ("bodies") and control structures ("brains") evolve over time against a user's predefined [[fitness landscape]] (for instance, evolving for speed), or spontaneously coevolve in a complex environment. [[Evolution]] of organisms occurs primarily through [[artificial selection]], where an intelligent selector chooses the selection parameters and mutation rates. Also the organisms rate of crossing-over can be chosen thus reflecting the sharing of genes by mating in nature. The simulated organisms have genetic scripts inspired by DNA found in living organisms in nature. A user can isolate a particular organism in the [[gene pool]] and edit its [[genotype]]. Framsticks allows users to design organisms or manually edit the living genetic code of an organism. Users have the ability to seed the environment with energy orbs that the organisms convert to energy and material. Depending on how the organism does in its lifespan determines the future of the virtual gene pool. Gene pools can be exported and shared.

==Bodies==
The bodies are made up of various building blocks that are assembled according to a genetic script. Building blocks include: a rotator, hinge, muscle, structure, and receptor.

==Brains==
The brains are basic neural networks that show up as a network of firing neurons. The genetic script serves as the blueprints for the exact assembly and functioning of the neural network.

==World==
The world or ‘universe’ can be set to height-field editable as blocks and/or steep planes, ‘water’, flat, or a combination of all these and be edited by user as map in simple text-format. It has adjustable gravitation and water-level.

Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent.

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted.

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R.

Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====

Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

Without entering into metaphysical speculations, I may perhaps add that an analysis of the very concept of explanation would, naturally, begin and end with a renunciation as to explaining our own conscious activity.|bibcode=1933Natur.131..457B }} Full text on line at [http://www23.us.archive.org/stream/AtomicPhysicsHumanKnowledge/Bohr-AtomicPhysicsHumanKnowledge_djvu.txt us.archive.org].

Agent (substance)-causal accounts have been suggested by both [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref name="BerkeleyDancy1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Berkeley|author2=Jonathan Dancy|title=A treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cu7WAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875160-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Reid]].&lt;ref name="Reid2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Reid|title=Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind; An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense; And an Essay on Quantity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdYxuQAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=January 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=978-1-4077-2950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is required that what the agent causes is not causally determined by prior events. It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N.

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions.

Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[history]] of [[in vitro fertilisation]]''' goes back more than half a century.

==Early developments==
There was a transient biochemical pregnancy reported by Australian Foxton School researchers in 1953. [[John_Rock_(American_scientist)|John Rock]] was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |title=John Rock's Error |journal=The New Yorker |date=10 March 2000 |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |accessdate=17 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511133811/http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Min Chueh Chang]] at the [[Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology|Worcester Foundation]], proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit. Chang's discovery was seminal, as it clearly demonstrated that oocytes fertilised in vitro were capable of developing, if transferred into the uterus and thereby produce live young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | last2 = Trounson | first2 = A. | last3 = Dawson | first3 = K. | last4 = Jones | first4 = H. | last5 = Hazekamp | first5 = J. | last6 = Nygren | first6 = K.

==Early, non-viable pregnancies==
The first pregnancy achieved through ''in vitro'' human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the [[Monash University]] team of [[Carl Wood]], John Leeton and [[Alan Trounson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720070634/http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660 History Of IVF]. monashivf.com&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy. [[Landrum Shettles]] attempted to perform an IVF in 1973, but his departmental chairman interdicted the procedure at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/babies-bio-shettles/ Biography: Landrum Shettles]. Pbs.org. Retrieved on 3 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Robin Marantz. (28 December 2003) [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-second-best.html THE LIVES THEY LIVED; Second Best. ''New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by [[Patrick Steptoe]] and [[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] in 1976. 

==First baby==
In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, [[Louise Brown]] on 25 July 1978, in [[Oldham General Hospital]], Greater Manchester, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Second baby==
In October 1978, it was reported that [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subash Mukhopadyay]], a relatively unknown physician from [[Kolkata]], India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as "Durga" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The New Scientist, 18 October 1978, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101005/jsp/frontpage/story_13020013.jsp |title=Test tube triumph &amp; tragedy – Nobel for UK scientist stirs memory of a Bengal doctor |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkEko0DybuQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==First boy and transformation from pure research to treatment==
Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 1979, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; A team led by [[Ian Johnston (doctor)|Ian Johnston]] and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, London, 24 June 1980, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.

This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. [[Howard W. Jones]] and [[Georgeanna Seegar Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesinstitute.org/ |title=The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine website |publisher=Jonesinstitute.org |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.

==Subsequent refinements==
The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kyono K, Uto H, Nakajo Y, Kumagai S, Araki Y, Kanto S |title=Seven pregnancies and deliveries from non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patients using fresh and frozen testicular sperm |journal=J.

Palermo]] et al.in Brussels ([[UZ Brussel]]), 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.biomedcentral.com/1743-1050/pubmed/1351601 Pregnancies after intracytoplasmic injection of single spermatozoon into an oocyte]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. G Palermo, H Joris, P Devroey, AC Van Steirteghem - Lancet, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Okada H, Goda K, Muto S, Maruyama O, Koshida M, Horie S |title=Four pregnancies in nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome using cryopreserved-thawed testicular spermatozoa |journal=Fertil.

==Recognition==
[[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] was awarded the 2010 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for the development of ''in vitro'' fertilization".&lt;ref name="nobelpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2010/press.html |title=The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steptoe and [[Jean Purdy]] were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosden |first1=Roger |title=Jean Marian Purdy remembered – the hidden life of an IVF pioneer |journal=Human Fertility |date=7 September 2017 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=86–89 |doi=10.1080/14647273.2017.1351042}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Wood]] was dubbed "the father of IVF (''in vitro'' fertilisation)" for having pioneered the use of frozen embryos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P003036b.htm Wood, Edwin Carlyle (1929 – )].

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
The [[British Humanist Association]]'s [https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/ definition of Humanism]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

===Scholarly tradition===
====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-theistic worldviews===
====Secular humanists====
{{main|Secular humanism}}

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two.

I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

'''Isogamy''' is a form of [[sexual reproduction]] that involves [[gamete]]s of similar [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (similar shape and size), differing in general only in [[allele]] [[Gene expression|expression]] in one or more [[mating-type region]]s. Because both gametes look alike, they cannot be classified as "[[male]]" or "[[female]]". Instead, organisms undergoing isogamy are said to have different [[mating type]]s, most commonly noted as "+" and "&amp;minus;" strains, although in some species of [[Basidiomycota]] there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters). In all cases, [[fertilization]] occurs when gametes of two different mating types fuse to form a [[zygote]].

==Evolution==
It appears that isogamy was the first stage of [[sexual reproduction]]. In several lineages (plants, animals), this form of reproduction independently evolved to [[anisogamy|anisogamous]] species with [[gamete]]s of male and [[female]] types to [[oogamy|oogamous]] species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|978-0-674-03116-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ascomycetes]], anisogamy (sexes) evolved from isogamy before mating types.&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. and Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2017|reason=Page number appears wrong. Someone should find the right page}}

==Biological types==

===With motile cells===
There are several types of isogamy. Both gametes may be [[Flagellum|flagellated]] and thus [[Motility|motile]]. This type occurs for example in [[algae]] such as some but not all species of ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''.

===With non-motile cells===
In another type, neither of the gametes is flagellated. This is the case for example in the [[mating of yeast]]. Yeast mating types are commonly noted as "a" and "α" (alpha) instead of "+" and "-".

===Conjugation===
Another, more complex form, is conjugation (similar to the exchange of genetic material through a bridge in [[bacterial conjugation]], but involving reproduction). This occurs in some the green algae, the [[Zygnematophyceae]], e.g., ''[[Spirogyra]]''. These algae grow as filaments of cells. When two filaments of opposing mating types come close together, the cells form conjugation tubes between the filaments. Once the tubes are formed, one cell balls up and crawls through the tube into the other cell to fuse with it, forming a zygote.

In [[ciliates]], cell fission may follow self-fertilization ([[autogamy]]), or it may follow conjugation (exchange of nuclei).

In [[zygomycete]]s fungi, two [[hyphae]] of opposing mating types form special structures called [[gametangia]] where the hyphae touch. The gametangia then fuse into a [[zygospore|zygosporangium]]. In other fungi, cells from two hyphae with opposing mating types fuse, but only the cytoplasm is fused ([[plasmogamy]]). The two nuclei do not fuse, leading to the formation of a [[dikaryon]] cell that gives rise to a [[mycelium]] consisting of dikaryons. [[Karyogamy]] (fusion of nuclei) then eventually occurs in [[sporangia]], and leads to the formation of diploid cells (zygotes) that immediately undergo [[meiosis]] to form [[spore]]s.
[[File:SpirogyraConjugation100x.jpg|thumb|Spirogyra conjugation]]
In many cases, isogamous fertilization is used by organisms that can also reproduce asexually through [[binary fission]], [[budding]], or asexual [[spore formation]]. The switch to [[sexual reproduction]] mode is often triggered by a change from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=H |last2=Bernstein |first2=C |last3=Michod |first3=RE |year=2011 |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |editor=Inna Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 |publisher=InTech |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilization often leads to the formation of a thick-walled zygotic [[resting spore]] that can withstand harsh environments and will germinate once growing conditions turn favorable again.

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', "changing one's mind") has been used in psychology since at least the time of American thinker [[William James]] to describe a process of fundamental change in the human personality.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words μετά ([[Meta|''metá'']]) (meaning "beyond" or "after") and  νόος ([[Nous|''noeō'']]) (meaning "perception" or "understanding" or "mind"), and takes on different meanings in different contexts.

==Developments==
William James used the term metanoia to refer to a fundamental and stable change in an individual's life-orientation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Carl Gustav Jung]] developed the usage to indicate a spontaneous attempt of the psyche to heal itself of unbearable conflict by melting down and then being reborn in a more adaptive form – a form of self healing often associated with the [[mid-life crisis]] and psychotic breakdown, which can be viewed as a potentially productive process.&lt;ref&gt;R. Arp. ''1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think'' (2013) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered that psychotic episodes in particular could be understood as an [[existential crisis]] which might be an attempt at self-reparation: in such instances metanoia could represent a shift in the balance of the personality away from the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] towards the [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow]] and the self.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's concept of metanoia influenced [[R. D. Laing]] and his emphasis on the dissolution and replacement of everyday ego consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Leeming et al, ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (2010) p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Laing's colleague, [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], considered that "metanoia means change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance" – a process that in the second of its three stages "generates the 'signs' of depression and mourning".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (1974) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly influenced was the [[therapeutic community]] movement. Ideally, it aimed to support people whilst they broke down and went through spontaneous healing, rather than thwarting such efforts at self-repair by strengthening a person's existing character defences and thereby maintaining the underlying conflict.

In [[transactional analysis]], metanoia is used to describe the experience of abandoning an old scripted self or [[false self]] for a more open one: a process which may be marked by a mixture of intensity, despair, self-surrender, and an encounter with the inner void.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 63-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miro Aaltonen''' (born 7 June 1993) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]. He is currently playing with [[HC Vityaz]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-sign-khl-forward-miro-aaltonen-entry-level-contract/  | title = Miro Aaltonen signing with Toronto Maple Leafs | publisher = ''[[Sportsnet.ca]]'' | date = 2017-03-17 | accessdate = 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was selected by [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] in the 2nd round (45th overall) of the [[2011 KHL Junior Draft]], and he was also selected by the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the 6th round (177th overall) of the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Following the [[2016-17 KHL season|2016–17]] season, after recording a career best 44 points in 59 games after his first season with [[HC Vityaz]] in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], he signed an entry-level contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] on March 17, 2017.

Despite a strong push for a roster spot as the Leafs' [[Line (ice hockey)|fourth-line]] center, he was assigned to the Maple Leafs [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Toronto Marlies]] for the [[2017–18 AHL season|2017–18]] season. In adapting to his first North American season, Aaltonen established himself among the offensive leaders with the Marlies, contributing with 20 goals and 43 points in 64 regular season games. Unable to earn a call up to the NHL, Aaltonen continued in the post-season with the Marlies, helping claim the club's first [[Calder Cup]] in posting 13 points in 20 games.

As an impending restricted free agent from the Maple Leafs but unable to make his NHL debut, Aaltonen opted to return to the KHL on a contract with former Russian club, Vityaz on July 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = http://www.hcvityaz.ru/news.php?full=9650 | title = Miro Aaltonen returns to Vityaz | publisher = ''[[HC Vityaz]]'' | date = 2018-07-01 | accessdate = 2018-07-01 | language = Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], '''missional living''' is the adoption of the posture, thinking, behaviors, and practices of a [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] in order to engage others with the [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]] message. The missional church movement, a [[church renewal]] movement predicated on the necessity of missional living by Christians, gained popularity at the end of the twentieth century due to advocates like [[Timothy J. Keller|Tim Keller]] and others in the Gospel and Our Culture Network.  Advocates contrast missional living with the concept of a select group of "professional" missionaries, emphasizing that all Christians should be involved in the [[Great Commission]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Keller, "The Missional church by Tim Keller" http://download.redeemer.com/pdf/learn/resources/Missional_Church-Keller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Understanding ''Missional''==
The missional living concept is rooted in the ''[[Missio dei]]'' (Latin, "the sending of God"). In 1934, Karl Hartenstein, a German [[Missiology|missiologist]], coined the phrase in response to [[Karl Barth]] and his emphasis on ''actio Dei'' ("the action of God"). In their view, missional activities stemming from God.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, David J, Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1991), 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Triune God is the primary acting agent in the world and within the church.

According to Lesslie Newbigin and Jesus' statements in the Gospel according to John, every Christian has been sent by Jesus with the gospel together in community to those in the surrounding culture for the sake of the King and His kingdom: “The Church is sent into the world to continue that which he came to do, in the power of the same Spirit, reconciling people to God.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Lesslie Newbigin]], ''The Gospel in a Pluralist Society'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1989, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, “As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you” (John 20:21).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No one can say: ‘Since I’m not called to be a missionary, I do not have to evangelize my friends and neighbors.’ There is no difference, in spiritual terms, between a missionary witnessing in his home town and a missionary witnessing in Katmandu, Nepal. We are all called to go—even if it is only to the next room, or the next block.”"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hale, ''On Being a Missionary'', p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==A missional (missionary) perspective==
''Missional living'' is the embodiment of the mission of Jesus in the world by incarnating the gospel. "It is imperative that Christians be like Jesus, by living freely within the culture as missionaries who are as faithful to the Father and his gospel as Jesus was in his own time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]], ''The Radical Reformission'', Zondervan, 2004, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This embodiment of the gospel is often referred to as "contextualization" or "inculturation."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Both refer to more than a simple translation of the gospel into different languages and cultures in the way that one translates a history book or a science text. Rather, they point to the embodiment of the living Word in human culture and social settings in such a way that its divine nature and power are not lost. True contextualization is more than communication. It is God working in the hearts of people, making them new and forming them into a new community. It is his Word transforming their lives, their societies, their cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hiebert and Eliose Hiebert Meneses, ''Incarnational Ministry'', Baker Book House, 1995, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five biblical distinctives form the foundation of a missional perspective:&lt;ref&gt;Dave DeVries, ''Missional Transformation: Fueling Missionary Movements that Transform America'', Bakke Graduate University, 2007, 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Church is sent by Jesus Christ (John 17:18; 20:21, Luke 9:2; Matt 28: 19–20; Acts 1:8)
# The Church is sent with the Cross (1 Cor 1:18, Eph 2:16, Col 2:14, 1 Pet2:24, 2 Cor 5:17–24)
# The Church is sent in Community (Acts 2:42–47; 5:42; John 13:34–35; 1 John 3:16–17)
# The Church is sent to every Culture (John 1:14; Matt 20:28; Acts 17:22–34; Luke 5:29)
# The Church is sent for the King and His Kingdom (Matt 10:7; 25:34; Luke 4:43; Rev 11:15–17; Jer 10:7; John 18:36)

[[Image:A Missional Perspective.JPG]]

===Sent===
Jesus sent His disciples on a mission. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission—being sent ones who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific culture. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jesus was the first apostle. He was sent by his Father. He, in turn, sent the Twelve. They went to people who would then take the gospel to the rest of the world. Whoever received it would understand that they, too, had been sent. With the gospel being what it is, the church as bearer of the gospel is bound to be apostolic."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Petersen and Mike Shamy, ''The Insider'', NavPress, 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cross===
Jesus Christ said that He came to earth to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He accomplished salvation through the cross. By dying on the cross, He paid the penalty for sin and satisfied God’s wrath. According to Scripture, without the cross, there is no salvation, no forgiveness, and no hope; because of the cross, there is eternal life. The mission and message of Jesus surround the cross. “For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor 1:18).

===Community===
Jesus loves the Church and He gave His life to redeem the Church. Community exists for Mission! Christians are to bring the gospel ''together'' to the culture. "The church is called to ''do'' the work of Christ, to be the means of his ''action'' in and for the world....Mission, in its widest as well as its more focused senses, is what the church is there for. God intends to put the world to rights; he has dramatically launched this project through Jesus. Those who belong to Jesus are called, here and now, in the power of the Spirit, to be agents of that putting-to-rights purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2006, 201, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
George Peters notes, “If man is to be reached, he must be reached within his own culture.”&lt;ref&gt;George Peters, ''A Biblical Theology of Missions'', Moody Press, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  This principle is observed when God became a man in the form of Jesus to come to earth and incarnate the gospel. As missionaries sent by Jesus, every Christian must learn to exegete their surrounding culture, uncovering the language, values, and ideas of the culture. Using this information, they take steps to reach people with the gospel message in the context of the surrounding culture.

===King and Kingdom===
The kingdom was central to Jesus’ message and mission. The Book of Acts ends with Paul, under house arrest in Rome, “proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:31). Christians are sent to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom so that others may enter the kingdom.
George Hunsberger conveys the idea that the Church is pointing beyond itself to the kingdom of God. The Church is not an end in itself; God has a mission that goes beyond the Church which includes the kingdom. The kingdom and the Church must never be divorced, yet they also must never be equated. In a similar way, “the reign must never be separated from the One who reigns.”&lt;ref&gt;George R. Hunsberger, “Called and Sent to Represent the Reign of God,” in ''Missional Church'', ed. Darrel Guder, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The kingdom is always at the heart of the King.

==The missional church==
The missional church movement first arose during the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. The movement seeks to rethink and redefine the nature of the church and create a new paradigm in which churches are seen as missional in nature, instead of attractional in nature. Leaders in the movement argue that instead of churches attempting to attract people to churches through church programs, churches should instead take the gospel outside of the church and engage society with the gospel, often by being involved not only in missions and evangelism but also in social justice movements. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission — being ''sent ones'' who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific cultural context. &lt;blockquote&gt;The church exists, in other words, for what we sometimes call "mission": to announce to the world that Jesus is its Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wright (theologian)|N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', 2006, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mission is not just a program of the church. It defines the church as God’s sent people. Either we are defined by mission, or we reduce the scope of the gospel and the mandate of the church. Thus our challenge today is to move from church with mission to missional church."&lt;ref&gt;Guder, ed., ''Missional Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Christian church|Church]] has a mission because Jesus has a mission. There is one mission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic [[organizing principle]] is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people."
&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hirsch]], ''The Forgotten Ways'', Brazos, 2007, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Missional living is a term that is used in contrast with historical institutional churches. Church leaders as well as Christians in general have often regarded the Church as an institution to which outsiders must come in order to receive a certain product, namely, the gospel and all its associated benefits. Institutional churches are sometimes perceived to exist for the members and depend on pastors and staff to evangelize the lost. The "missional church", on the other hand, attempts to take Christ to "the lost" and its members are personally engaged in reaching their communities with the message of Jesus Christ.

'''Noble Ape''' is an [[artificial life]] development project launched in June, 1996 by [[Tom Barbalet]]. It was designed to be a forum for a diversity of contributors to work towards a coherent [[cognitive]] [[simulation]] development environment.&lt;ref name="FIRST"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Noble Ape History

  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Simulation==
The central software of the project is the [http://www.nobleape.com/sim/ Noble Ape Simulation], based on the ideas outlined in [http://www.nobleape.com/man/philosophic.html Noble Ape Philosophic]. There are two primary aims of the Simulation;
* to simulate the biological environment the Noble Apes inhabit, and,
* to simulate the Noble Apes' [[cognitive]] processes.&lt;ref name="SECOND"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Noble Ape Simulation
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/sim/
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Noble Apes move around and react to external and internal events (weather, fear, panic, sleep, ...). Noble Ape integrates many concepts in the areas of [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name="THIRD"&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==
Noble Ape is available as [[open source software]], under the [http://www.nobleape.com/man/legal.html Noble Ape Open Source License], and is distributed with Apple Computer's [[Apple Developer Tools#CHUD Tools|CHUD Tools]], included with every new [[Apple Macintosh]] computer and is used by [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="FOURTH"&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Tom
  | title = Graphics in the Noble Ape Simulation
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/docs/sim_graph.html
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Noble Ape Simulation also contains the [[programming language]], [[ApeScript]].&lt;ref name="SEVENTH"&gt;{{cite web

  | title = Introduction to ApeScript
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/man/apescript_intro.html
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble Ape also features a [[podcast]], [http://www.nobleape.com/reality/ Ape Reality], where various aspects of the programming, biology, philosophy and meta-theory behind the development are discussed.&lt;ref name="EIGHT"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet

  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Noble Ape received a grant from the [[Australian Film Commission]] in 1998. Barbalet used this money to buy computer hardware and record an audio CD/CDROM, ''Isle of the Apes''. Having returned from the US at the end of 1998, Barbalet recorded the second CD/CDROM, ''Mind Monkeys and Purrfect Beats'' (sic). A collection of tracks from these CDs were released on the 2018 digital compilation ''Noble Ape: Project Music''. In mid-2018, Barbalet released the single ''June 13 (This is Noble Ape)'' to address some of the challenges the development has experienced over twenty two years.&lt;ref name="TENTH"&gt;{{cite web

  | title = This is Noble Ape (Youtube)
  | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJKgyfwONXI
  | accessdate = 2018-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video Project==

To celebrate twenty-two years of continuous development, Barbalet undertook an at-least a video per day [[vlog]] project documenting many different aspects of Noble Ape that had not been previously talked about. Barbalet noted that the reason to do this on [[YouTube]] and [[Instagram]] was to introduce a new audience to his work.&lt;ref name="ELEVENTH"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Tom Barbalet's YouTube Channel
  | url=https://www.youtube.com/barbalet/
  | accessdate = 2018-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-Projects==

Noble Ape provided the core of six different sub-projects that had been developed by Barbalet and others through the Noble Ape development history. These six sub-projects are actively maintained under the Noble Ape development.&lt;ref name="TWELTH"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet

  | accessdate = 2018-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noble Warfare===

Noble Warfare was developed by Barbalet in [[Wilmslow]] in Cheshire. Inspired by [[Lindow Man]], Barbalet reflected on the impact unwritten wars had through history on a local population. He was also inspired by the [[Total War (series)]] of video games. Noble Warfare pits two armies defined through an [[ApeScript]]-like interface and shows how the resolution of the battles can be covered by many different probabilistic outcomes.

===Mushroom Boy===

The early development of the Mushroom Boy came from Barbalet's time in [[Canberra]], Australia. The simulation is based in a vast [[suburb]]-based landscape and uses a number of core technologies in Noble Ape to create the environment and the entities that wander through the suburban environment. The name comes from an urban terrorism simulation Barbalet initially developed with the sub-project.

===Planet Noble Ape===

Planet Noble Ape was initially developed by Barbalet in [[Sunnyvale]], California. It provides the Noble Ape Simulation as part of a planetary simulation.

===Ecosim===

Ecosim takes the ideas of the Noble Ape Simulation and creates an educational tool specifically developed to highlight concepts in biodiversity. It was developed by Barbalet in 1997-1998 based on correspondence with a high school science teacher in Australia who wanted to have a tool to teach biodiversity based on Barbalet's work with Noble Ape.

===Noble Ape Skeleton===

This sub-project comes from the work of Bob Mottram to create a [[skeleton]] and [[vascular]] simulation based on the Noble Ape Simulation. The sub-project is based on taking Mottram's work and re-integrating it with the ongoing development.

===Noble Insect===

Noble Insect came from Barbalet's time in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. It is based on taking an [[insect brain]] and simulating that interaction with ideas and concepts developed through Noble Ape.

'''Normative ethics''' is the study of [[ethics|ethical]] action. It is the branch of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[ethics]] that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. 

Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts; and it is distinct from [[applied ethics]] in that the former is more concerned with 'who ought one be' rather than the ethics of a specific issue (such as if, or when, abortion is acceptable).

Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an empirical investigation of people’s moral beliefs. In this context normative ethics is sometimes called ''prescriptive'', rather than ''descriptive'' ethics. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Cavalier | first =Robert | title =Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics | work =Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy

 | accessdate = 2014-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional moral theories rest on principles that determine whether an action is right or wrong. Classical theories in this vein include [[utilitarianism]], [[Kantianism]], and some forms of [[contractarianism]]. These theories mainly offered the use of overarching moral principles to resolve difficult moral decisions.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Normative ethical theories==
There are disagreements about what precisely gives an action, rule, or disposition its ethical force. There are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each.  [[Virtue ethics]] focuses on the character of those who are acting, while both [[deontological ethics]] and [[consequentialism]] focus on the status of the action, rule, or disposition itself.  The latter two conceptions of ethics themselves come in various forms.

* [[Virtue ethics]], advocated by [[Aristotle]] with some aspects being supported by [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]], focuses on the inherent character of a person rather than on specific actions. There has been a significant revival of virtue ethics in the past half-century, through the work of such philosophers as [[G. E. M. Anscombe]], [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair Macintyre]], [[Mortimer J. Adler]], [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Yves Simon]], and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]].
* [[Deontological ethics|Deontology]] argues that decisions should be made considering the factors of one's duties and one's rights. Some deontological theories include:
** [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Categorical Imperative]], which roots morality in humanity's rational capacity and asserts certain inviolable moral laws.
** The [[contractualism]] of [[John Rawls]], which holds that the moral acts are those that we would all agree to if we were unbiased.
** [[Natural rights]] theories, such that of [[John Locke]] or [[Robert Nozick]], which hold that human beings have absolute, natural rights.
* [[Consequentialism]] (teleology) argues that the morality of an action is contingent on the action's outcome or result. Consequentialist theories, differing in what they consider valuable ([[Axiology]]), include:
** [[Utilitarianism]], which holds that an action is right if it leads to the most ''happiness'' for the greatest number of people.  ''(Historical note: Prior to the coining of the term "consequentialism" by Anscombe in 1958 and the adoption of that term in the literature that followed, "utilitarianism" was the generic term for consequentialism, referring to all theories that promoted maximizing ''any'' form of utility, not just those that promoted maximizing happiness.)''
** [[State consequentialism]] or Mohist consequentialism, which holds that an action is right if it leads to ''state welfare'', through ''order'', ''material wealth'', and ''population growth''.
** [[Ethical egoism|Egoism]], the belief that the moral person is the self-interested person, holds that an action is right if it maximizes ''good for the self''.
** [[Situational ethics|Situation Ethics]], which holds that the correct action is the one that creates the most loving result, and that ''love'' should always be our goal.
** [[Intellectualism]], which dictates that the best action is the one that best fosters and promotes ''knowledge''.
** [[Welfarism]], which argues that the best action is the one that most increases ''economic well-being or welfare''.
** [[Preference utilitarianism]], which holds that the best action is the one that leads to the most overall ''preference satisfaction''.
* [[Ethics of care]] or relational ethics, founded by [[feminist theory|feminist theorists]], notably [[Carol Gilligan]], argues that morality arises out of the experiences of empathy and compassion.  It emphasizes the importance of interdependence and relationships in achieving ethical goals.
* [[Pragmatic ethics]] is difficult to classify fully within any of the four preceding conceptions.  This view argues that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over concern with consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile concerns, provided social reform is also addressed). [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]], are known as the founders of pragmatism.
* [[Role ethics]] is based on the concept of family roles.

==Binding force==
It can be unclear what it means to say that a person "ought to do X because it is moral, whether they like it or not". [[Morality]] is sometimes presumed to have some kind of special binding force on behaviour, but some philosophers think that, used this way, the word "ought" seems to wrongly attribute magic powers to morality.  For instance, [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] worries that "ought" has become "a word of mere mesmeric force".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Anscombe. (1958).  "Modern Moral Philosophy". Philosophy 33, No 24.&lt;/ref&gt; British ethicist [[Philippa Foot]] elaborates that morality does not seem to have any special binding force, and she clarifies that people only behave morally when motivated by other factors.
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40em| quote  = If he is an amoral man he may deny that he has any reason to trouble his head over this or any other moral demand. Of course, he may be mistaken, and his life as well as others' lives may be most sadly spoiled by his selfishness. But this is not what is urged by those who think they can close the matter by an emphatic use of 'ought'. My argument is that they are relying on an illusion, as if trying to give the moral 'ought' a magic force.| salign=right|source = —Philippa Foot&lt;ref name=FootHypo/&gt;}}

Foot says "People talk, for instance, about the 'binding force' of morality, but it is not clear what this means if not that we feel ourselves unable to escape."&lt;ref name=FootHypo/&gt; The idea is that, faced with an opportunity to steal a book because we can get away with it, moral obligation itself has no power to stop us unless we ''feel'' an obligation.  Morality may therefore have no binding force beyond regular human motivations, and people must be motivated to behave morally. The question then arises: what role does reason play in motivating moral behaviour?

===Motivating morality===
{{see also|Science of morality#Causes of flourishing|label 1=Causes of good behaviour}}

The [[categorical imperative]] perspective suggests that proper reason always leads to particular moral behaviour. As mentioned above, Foot instead believes that humans are actually motivated by desires. Proper reason, on this view, allows humans to discover actions that get them what they want (i.e., hypothetical imperatives)—not necessarily actions that are moral.

Social structure and motivation can make morality binding in a sense, but only because it makes moral norms feel inescapable, according to Foot.&lt;ref name=FootHypo/&gt;
&lt;!-- The following image is disabled while I try to understand how to link to the commons picture of that name, not [[File:Shame.jpg]] as it appears here on wikipedia...
[[Wikimedia:commons:File:Shame.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Feelings like shame and love are sometimes considered the only meaningful sense in which morality is binding. Absent those feelings, a person could behave "immorally" without remorse.]]--&gt;
[[John Stuart Mill]] adds that external pressures, to please others for instance, also influence this felt binding force, which he calls human "conscience". Mill says that humans must first reason about what is moral, then try to bring the feelings of our conscience in line with our reason.&lt;ref name=MillChap3/&gt; At the same time, Mill says that a good moral system (in his case, utilitarianism) ultimately appeals to aspects of human nature — which, must themselves be nurtured during upbringing. Mill explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This firm foundation is that of the social feelings of mankind; the desire to be in unity with our fellow creatures, which is already a powerful principle in human nature, and happily one of those which tend to become stronger, even without express inculcation, from the influences of advancing civilisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mill thus believes that it is important to appreciate that it is feelings that drive moral behavior, but also that they may not be present in some people (e.g. [[psychopaths]]). Mill goes on to describe factors that help ensure people develop a conscience and behave morally, and thinkers like Joseph Daleiden describe how societies can use science to figure out how to [[Science of morality#Causes of flourishing|make people more likely to be good]].

An '''oospore''' is a thick-walled sexual [[spore]] that develops from a fertilized [[oosphere]] in some [[algae]], [[fungi]], and [[Oomycete]]s. They are believed to have evolved either through the [[Somatic fusion|fusion]] of two species or the chemically-induced stimulation of mycelia, leading to oospore formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemical Stimulation of Oospore Formation in Phytophthora capsici|first1=J. Y. |last1=Uchida |first2=M. |last2=Aragaki|journal=Mycologia|volume=72|issue=6|doi=10.2307/3759563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oomycetes, oospores can also result from asexual reproduction, by [[apomixis]]. These are found in Fungi as the sexual spores; these help in the sexual reproduction of Fungi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C. K.|date=August 2013|title=Antimüllerian hormone inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone-induced adenylyl cyclase activation, aromatase expression, and estradiol production in human granulosa-lutein cells|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=2|pages=585–592.e1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.04.019|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23663993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Liu|first2=Lian|last3=Adhikari|first3=Deepak|last4=Jagarlamudi|first4=Krishna|last5=Rajareddy|first5=Singareddy|last6=Shen|first6=Yan|last7=Du|first7=Chun|last8=Tang|first8=Wenli|last9=Hämäläinen|first9=Tuula|date=2008-02-01|title=Oocyte-specific deletion of Pten causes premature activation of the primordial follicle pool|journal=Science|volume=319|issue=5863|pages=611–613|doi=10.1126/science.1152257|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18239123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuang|first=Haibin|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Peng|first3=Jing|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=December 2009|title=Premature ovarian failure, menopause and ovarian cancer, three nodes on the same string: Pten and other potential genes on the go|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=73|issue=6|pages=961–962|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.023|issn=1532-2777|pmid=19733443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

[[FOXO3|Foxo3a]] - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Wendy J.|last2=Umbers|first2=Alexandra J.|last3=Woad|first3=Kathryn J.|last4=Harris|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Winship|first5=Ingrid M.|last6=Gersak|first6=Ksenija|last7=Shelling|first7=Andrew N.|date=November 2006|title=Mutational screening of FOXO3A and FOXO1A in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1518–1521|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.054|issn=1556-5653|pmid=16979636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Binbin|last2=Mu|first2=Yuan|last3=Ni|first3=Feng|last4=Zhou|first4=Sirui|last5=Wang|first5=Jing|last6=Cao|first6=Yunxia|last7=Ma|first7=Xu|date=April 2010|title=Analysis of FOXO3 mutation in 114 Chinese women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=20|issue=4|pages=499–503|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.01.008|issn=1472-6491|pmid=20219431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53895">'''Pessimism''' is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an [[optimism|optimist]] is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Bennett, Oliver. ''Cultural pessimism.'' Edinburgh university press.  2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical pessimism''' is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often [[existential nihilism|existential nihilists]] believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.

==Etymology==
The term pessimism derives from the Latin word ''pessimus'' meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by [[Jesuit]] critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel '[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of [[Leibniz]] who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the ''Revue de Trévoux'' accused him of ''pessimisme''.&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dienstag |first=Joshua Foa |title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=February 17, 2009 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical pessimism==&lt;!-- "Philosophical pessimism" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:DOI Rousseau.jpg|thumb|250px|Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' was an attack on the enlightenment idea of social progress which he saw as morally decadent.]]
Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a [[worldview]] or [[ethic]] that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the [[Idea of Progress]] and [[religious faith]]) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the [[Dialogue of Pessimism]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] (which maintains that everything is ''hevel'', literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean '[[senseless]]' and '[[absurdity|absurd]]'.)

In [[Western philosophy]], philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit'', Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as "that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense [[irony|ironic]]; that [[free will|freedom]] and [[happiness]] are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical pessimists see the [[self-consciousness]] of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this "terror" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can "progress" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, "our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense "absurd". [[Absurdism|Absurdity]] is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: "a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to [[Socrates]] and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Mainländer]], recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in [[Indian religions]] and [[Christian monasticism]]). Some followers tend to believe that "expecting the worst leads to the best." [[Rene Descartes]] even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to "negative" events were removed.  [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace [[nothingness]]. Others like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]] respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a "Dionysian pessimism", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: [[Suicide]], a [[leap of faith]] (as per [[Kierkegaard]]'s [[knight of faith]]), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers ([[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/|title= Wicks, Robert "Arthur Schopenhauer"|chapter= Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is [[aphorism|aphoristic writing]], and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Dino Buzzati]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], [[Thomas Ligotti]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]].

==Notable proponents==

===Ancient Greeks===
In ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]] (called "the Weeping Philosopher") and [[Parmenides]] represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the "enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heraclitus]] denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable "indefinite." And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: "I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before." ''The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.&lt;ref name="diogquote"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Hegesias}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: "for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference".&lt;ref name="diogquote"/&gt; According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called ''Death by Starvation'', which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BCE, [[Stoicism]] propounded as an exercise "the premeditation of evils"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Burkeman |title=The Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92fgjq7-qLwC |accessdate=2013-01-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921922671 |pages=32–33 |quote=[...] the Stoics propose a[n] elegant, sustainable and calming way to deal with the possibility of things going wrong: rather than struggling to avoid all thought of these worst-case scenarios, they counsel actively dwelling on them, staring them in the face. Which brings us to an important milestone on the negative path to happiness — a psychological tactic that William [B.] Irvine argues is 'the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' toolkit'. He calls it 'negative visualisation'. The Stoics themselves, rather more pungently, called it 'the premeditation of evils'. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltasar Gracián===
[[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel ''El Criticón'' was his favorite book{{citation needed|reason=This is a very definite claim|date=January 2015}}. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's ''The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence'' into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style ([[conceptismo]]) and often quoted him in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History dictionary of Schopenhauer's philosophy |last=Cartwright |first=David E. |publisher=Scarecrow press, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracian's novel ''El Criticón'' (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for [[happiness]] which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. ''The Critic'' paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His ''Pocket Oracle'' was a book of [[aphorisms]] on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence |last=Gracian |first=Balthasar |publisher=Penguin books |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltaire===
Voltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to his critique of [[Alexander Pope]]'s optimistic "An Essay on Man", and [[Leibniz]]' affirmation that "we live in the best of all possible worlds." Voltaire's novel [[Candide]] is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his [[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Poem on the Lisbon Disaster]] is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a [[Deist]], Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the [[problem of evil]].

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
The major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called "the patriarch of pessimism".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, humans in their "natural goodness" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the [[state of nature]] as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by ''amour propre'', a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives "always outside himself", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of "perfectibility" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus ''[[The Social Contract]]'' opens with the famous phrase "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are "greater slaves" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live "outside themselves".

===Giacomo Leopardi===
Though a lesser known figure outside Italy, [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that "Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that "it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing."

Leopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of [[Christopher Columbus]] who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogue between Columbus and Pedro Gutierrez (Operette morali) |last=Leopardi |first=Giacomo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: "He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die."

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer had an influence upon later thinkers and artists such as Freud and Wagner]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism comes from his elevating of [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] above [[reason]] as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] is the ultimate metaphysical animating [[noumenon]] and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one [[metaphor]], Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Pessimism |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60206-349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. 
He pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — ''The world as will and representation, pg 319'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging "like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', pg 312&lt;/ref&gt; This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (''nichtigkeit'') and to realize that "the purpose of our existence is not to be happy".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', vol II, pg 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt;

Schopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through "losing yourself" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of [[asceticism]] (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by "saintly persons") could free oneself from the Will altogether.

Schopenhauer never used the term ''pessimism'' to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common terms used to describe his thought were [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] and [[irrationalism]] which he also never used.

=== Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism&lt;!--'Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism' and 'Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, '''post-Schopenhauerian pessimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a rather popular "trend" in 19th century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Langer, ''Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as [[Hegelianism]], [[materialism]], [[Neo-Kantianism]] and the emerging [[positivism]]. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in [[science]], the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's [[transcendental idealism]] into what [[Frederick C. Beiser]] calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser]] reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: "Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of ''transcendental realism'', i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience." (Beiser, Frederick C., ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not [[things-in-themselves]]), the transcendental realist thesis is that "the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves."&lt;ref name=Beiser147&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the "Post-Schopenhauerian" thinkers inherited from the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt sage]]'s teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would "assuage" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing [[historicism]], as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor [[Julius Frauenstadt]] and with [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist).&lt;ref name=Beiser147/&gt; [[Julius Bahnsen]] would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Philipp Mainländer]] set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a "pessimism of the future", a "[[Dionysian]] pessimism."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'', book V&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek [[pre-socratic]]s and also saw it at the core of ancient [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as "morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and [[nihilism]]. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a "great liberation" through a "pessimism of strength" which "does not sit in judgement of this condition".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to "make oneself a new pair of wings", i.e. to [[Transvaluation of values|re-evaluate all values]] and create new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of [[amor fati]] and [[eternal recurrence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is "good for one's health" as a "remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Camus===
[[Image:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camus used the punishment of [[Sisyphus]] to represent the human condition.]]

In a 1945 article, [[Albert Camus]] wrote "the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea."&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=DV6H76TX&amp;tocp=13|title= Albert Camus, ''Pessimism and Courage''}}, ''Combat'', September 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Camus helped popularize the idea of "[[Absurdism|the absurd]]", a key term in his famous essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which "sets me in opposition to all creation".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Camus |title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-73373-7 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through "eluding" (''l'esquive''), a 'trickery' for "those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth" /&gt; He considered [[suicide]] and [[religion]] as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of [[Sisyphus]], who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

==Other forms==

=== Epistemological ===
There are several theories of [[epistemology]] which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to [[nihilism]], [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[relativism]].

[[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819), analyzed [[rationalism]], and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy in order to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} according to which all rationalism reduces to [[nihilism]], and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]].

[[Richard Rorty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|social relations of power]], or [[language-games]] that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of [[anti-foundationalism]], while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.

===Political and cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural pessimism}}
Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the [[optimism]] or even [[utopianism]] of [[Hegelian]] philosophies. [[Emil Cioran]] claimed "Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"&lt;ref name="Cioran"&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienstag|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of [[social progress]] can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, "every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 178&lt;/ref&gt; Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an "idolatry of tomorrow" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in [[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]].

There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of [[cultural criticism]] and [[social decline]] which is seen in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s '[[The Decline of the West]]'. Spengler promoted a [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]] similar to the theories of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Spengler believed modern [[western civilization]] was in the 'winter' age of decline (''untergang''). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in [[Weimar Germany]]. Similarly, traditionalist [[Julius Evola]] thought that the world was in the [[Kali Yuga]], a dark age of moral decline.

Intellectuals like [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] correlate economic progress with [[economic inequality]], the stimulation of artificial needs, and [[affluenza]]. [[Anti-consumerist]]s identify rising trends of [[conspicuous consumption]] and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like [[Jean Baudrillard]] have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt;

[[Conservative]] thinkers, especially [[social conservatives]], often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. [[William F. Buckley]] famously remarked that he was "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" and [[Whittaker Chambers]] was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to [[communism]], though he was himself violently [[anti-communist]]. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in [[Christianity]] and/or [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosophy]], leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. [[Robert Bork]]'s ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah'' and [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''The Closing of the American Mind'' are famous expressions of this point of view.

Many economic conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the [[welfare state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lowenthal |first=D |title=Orwell's Political Pessimism in '1984' |publisher=Polity |year=1969 |jstor=3234097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to [[emigrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brym |first=RJ |title=The emigration potential of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Russia: recent survey results |publisher=International Sociology |year=1992 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/soc101y/brym/is.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] in the United States, the [[neologism]] "[[pessimism porn]]" was coined to describe the alleged [[Eschatology|eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn?

===Technological and environmental===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|right|Luddites destroy machines (1812)]]
Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the [[industrial revolution]] with the [[Luddite]] movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The [[Romantic movement]] was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |title=Romanticism |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718052334/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social critics and environmentalists believe that [[globalization]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the economic practices of modern [[capitalist]] states over-stress the planet's [[Balance of nature|ecological equilibrium]]. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, [[climate change]] will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/apr/27/the-global-delusion/ The Global Delusion, John Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] believes that the [[ecology]] of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/a-great-jump-to-disaster/ A Great Jump to Disaster?, Tim Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]], [[anti-globalization]] activists, and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-luddites]] can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern "progress". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is [[anarcho-primitivism]] which faults the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote [[deindustrialization]], abandonment of modern technology and [[rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]].

An infamous anarcho-primitivist is [[Theodore Kaczynski]], also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'' he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern "industrial-technological system".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto begins thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the [[voluntary human extinction movement]] which argues for the extinction of the human race through [[antinatalism]].

[[Pope Francis]]' controversial [[Laudato si'|2015 encyclical on ecological issues]] is ripe with [[Laudato si'#Technology|pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world]].

====Entropy pessimism====
{{See also |Heat death of the universe |Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #The relevance of thermodynamics to economics |Ecological economics #Methodology}}
[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution.]]
'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principles]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#First law|first law of thermodynamics]], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] — also known as [[Entropy|the entropy law]] — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the [[heat death of the universe]], taken as a whole.

The term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field |progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts |paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|magnum opus on ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|545}}

Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369-371}} &lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253-256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168-171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150-153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106-109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546-549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142-145}}

Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [[ecological economics]] and in the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]].

===Legal===
Bibas writes that some [[criminal defense attorney]]s prefer to err on the side of pessimism: "Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bibas |first=Stephanos |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |publisher=Harvard Law Review |volume=117 |number=8 |date=Jun 2004 |pages=2463–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a psychological disposition==
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
In the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with [[Melancholia|melancholy]], and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. 
The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional [[suffering|pain]] or even biology. [[Aaron Beck]] argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world.  Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in [[Depressive realism]] or ([[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic realism]]).&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt; Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirszner |first=Laurie |date=January 2012 |title=Patterns for College Writing |location=United States |publisher=Bedford/St.Martins |page=477 |isbn=978-0-312-67684-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pessimism item on the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] has been judged useful in predicting suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=RA |last2=Steer |first3=M |last3=Kovacs |title=Hopelessness and eventual suicide: a 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=5 |pages=559–563 |year=1985 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/5/559|doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.559 |pmid=3985195 |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.6328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=A |last2=Weissman |first3=D |last3=Lester |first4=L |last4=Trexler |title=The measurement of pessimism: the hopelessness scale |publisher=Journal of Consulting and Clinical |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wender |first=PH |last2=Klein |first2=DF |title=Mind, Mood and Medicine |publisher=New American Library |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Pragmatic criticism===
Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael R. Michau. "Doing, Suffering, and Creating": William James and Depression.  http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mmichau/james-and-depression.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[William James]] rejected their pessimism after suffering [[psychological illness|psychological]], or even [[psychosomatic]] illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term "pessimism" is being abused. The link between pessimism and [[nihilism]] is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to [[optimism]], nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. ''[[Personality Plus]]'' opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. [[melancholy temperament|melancholy]] and [[phlegmatic temperament|phlegmatic]]) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. [[choleric temperament|choleric]] and [[sanguine temperament|sanguine]]) miss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15206">'''Repeated Implantation failure (RIF)''' is the failure of the [[embryo]] to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]] onto the side of the [[uterus]] wall following [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]] treatment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Regularly, this happens at 6-7 days after conception and involves the embedding of the growing embryo into the mothers uterus and a connection being formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norwitz|first=Errol R.|last2=Schust|first2=Danny J.|last3=Fisher|first3=Susan J.|date=2001-11-08|title=Implantation and the Survival of Early Pregnancy|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=en|volume=345|issue=19|pages=1400–1408|doi=10.1056/nejmra000763|pmid=11794174|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A successful implantation can be determined by using an [[ultrasound]] to view the [[Gestational sac|sac]] which the baby grows in, inside the uterus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, the exact definition of RIF is debated. Recently the most commonly accepted definition is when a women under 40 has gone through 3 unsuccessful cycles of IVF, when in each cycle 4 good quality eggs have been transferred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polanski|first=Lukasz T.|last2=Baumgarten|first2=Miriam N.|last3=Quenby|first3=Siobhan|last4=Brosens|first4=Jan|last5=Campbell|first5=Bruce K.|last6=Raine-Fenning|first6=Nicholas J.|date=April 2014|title=What exactly do we mean by 'recurrent implantation failure'? A systematic review and opinion|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=28|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.12.006|pmid=24581986|issn=1472-6483}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Repeated implantation failure should not be confused with recurrent IVF failure. Recurrent IVF failure is a much more broad term and includes all repeated failures to get pregnant from IVF. Repeated implantation failure specifically refers to those failures due to unsuccessful implanting to the uterus wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

An unsuccessful implantation can be down to either problems with the mother or with the embryo. It is essential that the mother and embryo are able to communicate with each other during all stages of [[pregnancy]], and an absence of this communication can lead to an unsuccessful implantation and a further unsuccessful pregnancy &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Alex|last2=Laufer|first2=Neri|date=May 2012|title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S001502821200324X|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1039–1043|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010|pmid=22464086|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Contributing Maternal Factors ==
During implantation, the embryo must cross the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] layer of the maternal [[endometrium]] before invading and implanting in the [[Stroma (tissue)|stroma]] layer. Maternal factors, including congenital uterine abnormalities, [[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s, [[Endometrial polyp|endometrial polyps]], intrauterine adhesions, [[adenomyosis]], [[thrombophilia]] and [[Endometriosis|endometriosis,]] can reduce the chances of implantation and result in RIF&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Congenital Uterine Abnormalities ===
Congenital uterine abnormalities are irregularities in the uterus which occur during the mothers foetal development&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===[[Hox gene|Hox]] Genes ===
Two genes have been identified to assist in the development and receptivity of the uterus and endometrium, [[HOXA10-HOXA9|Hoxa10]] and [[HOXA11|Hoxa11]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salleh|first=Naguib|last2=Giribabu|first2=Nelli|date=2014|title=Leukemia inhibitory factor: roles in embryo implantation and in nonhormonal contraception|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|volume=2014|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2014/201514|issn=1537-744X|pmc=4131495|pmid=25152902}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hoxa10 has been shown to change the upper uterine segment into [[Fallopian tube|oviduct]]-like structures, creating a smaller uterus that appears normal. Embryo transfer into the lower uterine segment does not allow for implantation, so the Hoxa10 gene has multiple effects throughout the uterus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Hoxa11 mutations alter the endometrial gland development and reduce the secretion of [[Leukemia inhibitory factor|Leukaemia-Inhibitory factor]] (LIF) which is required for implantation&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.
[[File:Uterine Fibroids.png|thumb|203x203px|Uterine Fibroid ]]

=== Fibroids ===
[[Uterine fibroid|Fibroid]]s are [[Benign tumor|benign tumours]] found in the [[smooth muscle]] of the uterus, they are often asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain. They effect implantation rates by altering the shape and [[cytokine]] composition of the uterus. Removal of [[submucosa]]l fibroids has shown to increase implantation rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endometrial Polyps ===
[[Endometrial polyp]]s are benign tumours found in the endometrium which factor into female infertility. There has been limited research into if their removal increases the chances of implantation and pregnancy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Intrauterine Adhesions ===
Intrauterine adhesions ([[Asherman's syndrome|Asherman's Syndrome]]) occur from scar tissue within the uterus which cause the closure of part or all of the uterus. The [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] prevent embryos from implanting by reducing the surface area and decreasing the receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salma|first=Umme|last2=Xue|first2=Min|last3=Md Sayed|first3=Ali Sheikh|last4=Xu|first4=Dabao|date=2014|title=Efficacy of intrauterine device in the treatment of intrauterine adhesions|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|pages=1–15|doi=10.1155/2014/589296|issn=2314-6141|pmc=4165200|pmid=25254212}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Intrauterine adhesions normally occur after damage has been caused to the [[endometrium]], either through removal of unwanted pregnancies, [[miscarriage]], [[infection]], and surgical damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Thrombophilia ===
[[Thrombophilia]] is a condition which makes the blood more likely to clot and this increases [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] risk, meaning the individual is at higher risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[Stroke|strokes]] or [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Ming Y|last2=Moll|first2=Stephan|date=April 2015|title=Thrombophilia|journal=Vascular Medicine|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=193–196|doi=10.1177/1358863x15575769|pmid=25832606|issn=1358-863X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In pregnancy it can lead to a disruption in the flow of blood to the [[placenta]] and the uterus wall. This can lead to a decreased receptivity of the uterus wall for a pregnancy and can lead to a miscarriage further on. However, how significantly this contributes to RIF is not fully known but each case should be assessed on a personal basis by a clinician &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{None}}

== Embryonic Factors ==
[[File:Translocation.gif|thumb|Figure 1: The exchange of chromosomal segments between chromosomes 4 to 20. Since no segments are lost, this is a balanced translocation.]]
The successful implantation of an embryo not only relies on a receptive uterine environment in the mother but also on the quality of the embryo itself. Embryo quality and probability of implantation can be affected by maternal and paternal genetic abnormalities as well as [[zona pellucida]] dysfunction and poor [[embryo transfer]] technique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Male Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[File:Blastocyst - 2.png|thumb|Figure 2: The zona pellucida surrounds the blastocyst cavity that contains the inner cell mass.]]
The quality of the [[sperm]] that [[Fertilisation|fertilizes]] an egg is a key contributor to the overall quality of the embryo. Abnormalities in [[DNA fragmentation]] and chromosomal arrangements are the main source of genetic deviation in males that can affect embryo quality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simon |first=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri |date=2012-09-14 |title=Assessment and treatment of repeated implantation failure (RIF) |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1227–1239 |doi=10.1007/s10815-012-9861-4 |pmc=3510376 |pmid=22976427}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fragmentation occurs when the strands of DNA are separated to form two separate strands, this disrupts the genetic information that is coded in genes. Depending on the severity of the fragmentation, this can lead to the dysfunction of specific genes which may or may not be essential for embryo survival and in this case the initiation of implantation. DNA fragmentation can happen spontaneously in cells that undergo programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) where DNA is broken apart by enzymes called [[Endonuclease|endonucleases]]. However, since the male DNA isn't activated until around day 3 after fertilisation, it is often difficult to diagnose sperm genetic abnormalities because morphological studies could identify a good quality oocyte when initial transfer occurs, but due to DNA fragmentation in the sperm, the embryo will die after day 3 of growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Female Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[Oocyte]] quality is also a main contributor to overall embryo quality since it is the DNA of the oocyte that is mainly involved in the first 3 days of embryo growth following fertilization. A major source of genetic abnormalities are [[Chromosomal translocation|balanced translocations]] (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A translocation involves the exchange of segments of chromosomes that are not a homologous pair. In most cases, this leads to balanced translocations, in which no DNA is lost therefore is usually asymptomatic. However, as female gametes are formed, it is probable that 2/3 of embryos produced will have unbalanced translocations within their DNA if fertilised by sperm with a balanced translocation too. Translocation mutations can occur at any point during fertilization or even the first meiotic division that the oocyte undergoes during foetal life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zona Pellucida Dysfunction ===
The female egg (oocyte) is surrounded by a layer of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called the zona pellucida. Once fertilisation has occurred, this layer will harden to prevent further sperm entering and maintain the shape of the fertilized egg ([[zygote]]) as it divides to form a [[blastocyst]] (Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2012-05-01 |title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1039–1043 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010 |pmid=22464086 |last1=Simon |first1=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the [[inner cell mass]] -  the group of cells within the blastocyst that go on to form the embryo - starts to expand, [[lysin]] enzymes secreted by the inner cell mass will act on the zona pellucida and weaken the hardened structure. Eventually, this will cause the rupture of the zona pellucida, allowing the blastocyst to hatch and begin to implant into the uterine wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If the zona pellucida fails to thin in preparation for rupture, this will prevent the blastocyst from hatching and therefore be unable to implant, therefore this is a probable cause of repeated implantation failure (RIF). This is supported by a study which showed that implantation rates in women who received assisted zona pellucida hatching - use of synthetic chemical to artificially weaken the zona pellucida - increased.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Investigations ==
Women with RIF should undergo ovarian function testing to explore their levels of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|AMH]] and any other hormones or [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] counts which may indicate the overall behaviour of the [[ovarian reserve]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coughlan |first=C. |last2=Ledger |first2=W. |last3=Wang |first3=Q. |last4=Liu |first4=Fenghua |last5=Demirol |first5=Aygul |last6=Gurgan |first6=Timur |last7=Cutting |first7=R. |last8=Ong |first8=K. |last9=Sallam |first9=H. |date=January 2014 |title=Recurrent implantation failure: definition and management |journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=14–38 |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.08.011 |pmid=24269084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male partners may also be offered laboratory testing of sperm DNA integrity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the instance of genetic testing, [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] may be made available to couples with RIF to exclude the possibility of balanced chromosomal translocations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Margalioth |first=E. J. |last2=Ben-Chetrit |first2=A. |last3=Gal |first3=M. |last4=Eldar-Geva |first4=T. |date=December 2006 |title=Investigation and treatment of repeated implantation failure following IVF-ET |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=3036–3043 |doi=10.1093/humrep/del305 |pmid=16905766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound|Ultrasounds]] may be used to oversee the morphological growth and development of follicles throughout IVF treatment, in addition to assessing endometrial thickness. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Hysteroscopy]] is an essential part of investigating a couple’s RIF pathology and is used as a diagnostic tool to examine the [[cervical canal]] and [[uterine cavity]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Management ==
In depth reviews of the underlying causes of a couple's [[infertility]] should be undertaken with a qualified fertility specialist in order to make decisions regarding further management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modifiable risk factors include [[smoking]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol consumption]] and [[Body mass index|BMI]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women with RIF should be advised to abstain from both alcohol and smoking, and male partners may also consider cessation of smoking due to effects associated with weaker sperm counts and damage to sperm DNA and motility. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An ideal BMI target for women with RIF is between 19 and 29; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Obesity|obese]] women may consider structured weight-loss programmes and regular exercise over [[bariatric surgery]] due to potential [[folate]], [[iron]], [[vitamin B12]] and other nutritional deficiencies. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sequential hermaphroditism''' (called '''dichogamy''' in [[botany]]) is a type of [[hermaphroditism]] that occurs in many [[fish]], [[gastropod]]s, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. 

In animals, the different types of change are male to female ('''protandry'''), female to male ('''protogyny'''),&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; female to hermaphrodite ('''protogynous hermaphroditism'''), and male to hermaphrodite ('''protandrous hermaphroditism'''). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the [[gonad]]s or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.&lt;ref name='carauth'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Freshwater cichlid ''Crenicara punctulata'' is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite | journal=Copeia | year=2000 | first=L. L. | last=Carruth | volume=2000 | pages=71–82 | doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0071:fccpia]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In plants, individual flowers are called dichogamous if their function has the two sexes separated in time, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at any one moment. A flower is protogynous if its function is first female, then male, and protandrous if its function is male then female. It used to be thought that this reduced [[inbreeding]], but it may be a more general mechanism for reducing pollen-pistil interference.

==Zoology==

===Protandry===
[[File:Anemone purple anemonefish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ocellaris clownfish]], ''Amphiprion ocellaris'', a protandrous animal species]]

Protandrous hermaphrodites are animals that are born male and at some point in their lifespan change sex to female. Protandrous animals include [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]]. Clownfish have a very structured society. In the ''[[Amphiprioninae#Taxonomy|Amphiprion]] percula'' species, there are zero to four individuals excluded from breeding and a breeding pair living in a [[sea anemone]]. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance]] is based on size, the female being the largest and the male being the second largest. The rest of the group is made up of progressively smaller non-breeders, which have no functioning gonads.&lt;ref name='Buston p'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Territory inheritance in clownfish | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2004 | first=P. M | last=Buston | volume=271 | pages=s252-s254| id=| pmc=1810038 | pmid=15252999 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the female dies, the male gains weight and becomes the female for that group. The largest non-breeding fish then sexually matures and becomes the male of the group.&lt;ref name='Buston'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does the Presence of Non-Breeders Enhance the Fitness of Breeders ? An Experimental Analysis in the Clown Anemonefish ''Amphiprion percula'' | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | year=2004 | first=P. | last=Buston | volume=57 | pages=23–31| id=| doi=10.1007/s00265-004-0833-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other protandrous fishes can be found in the classes [[clupeiformes]], [[siluriformes]], [[stomiiformes]], and within the perciform families [[pomacentridae]] and [[sparidae]]. Since these groups are distantly related and have many intermediate relatives that are not protandrous, it strongly suggests that protandry evolved multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avise|first1=J. C.|last2=Mank|first2=J. E.|title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes|journal=Sexual Development|date=2009|volume=3|issue=2–3|pages=152–163|doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of protandrous animals include:
* The [[ctenophore]] ''[[Coeloplana]] gonoctena''. In this organism the females are bigger than the males and are only found during the summer. In contrast males are found year-round.
* The flatworms ''[[Hymanella]] retenuova'' and ''[[Paravortex]] cardii''.
* ''[[Laevapex fuscus]]'', a [[gastropod]], is described as being functionally protandric. The [[sperm]] matures in late winter and early spring, the eggs mature in early summer, and [[copulation]] occurs only in June. This shows that males cannot reproduce until the females appear, thus why they are considered to be functionally protandric.&lt;ref name='Policansky'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sex change in plants and animals | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1982 | first=D. | last=Policansky | volume=13 | pages=471–495 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.002351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Russell-Hunter, W.

===Protogyny===
[[File:Thalassoma lunare 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moon wrasse]], ''Thalassoma lunare'', a protogynous animal species]]

Protogynous hermaphrodites are animals that are born female and at some point in their lifespan change sex to male. As the animal ages, based on internal or external triggers, it shifts sex to become a male animal. Male [[fecundity]] increases greatly with age, unlike female.

Protogyny is the most common form of hermaphroditism in fish in nature.&lt;ref name='Avise'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes | journal=Sexual Development | year=2009 | first=JC | last=Avise |author2=JE Mank  | volume=3 | pages=152–163| id=| doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 75% of the 500 known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species are protogynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauly|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139451819|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandian|first=TJ|title=Genetic Sex Differentiation in Fish|year=2012|publisher=Science Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common model organisms for this type of sequential hermaphroditism are [[wrasses]]. They are one of the largest families of coral reef fish and belong to the family Labridae. Wrasses are found around the world in all marine habitats and tend to bury themselves in sand at night or when they feel threatened.&lt;ref name='Animal Planet'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/guides/fish/marine/wrasseintro.html | title=Animal Planet :: Fish Guide -- Wrasse | accessdate=2011-03-28 | publisher=PetEducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wrasses, the larger of the two fish is the male, while the smaller is the female. In most cases, females and immature have a uniform color while the male has the terminal bicolored phase.&lt;ref name='Warner R'/&gt; Large males hold territories and try to pair spawn while small to mid-size initial-phase males live with females and group [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name='Adreani'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mating system and reproductive biology of a temperate wrasse, ''Halichoeres semicinctus'' | journal=Copeia | year=2008 | first=M. S. | last=Adreani |author2=Allen, L. G. | pages=467–475 | doi=10.1643/cp-06-265 | volume=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both the initial and terminal phase males can breed; however, they differ in the way they do it.

In the [[California sheephead]] (''Semicossyphus pulcher''), a type of wrasse, when the female changes to male, the ovaries degenerate and spermatogenic crypts appear in the gonads. The general structure of the gonads remains ovarian after the transformation and the sperm is transported through a series of ducts on the periphery of the gonad and [[oviduct]]. Here sex change is age-dependent. For example, the California sheephead stays a female for four years before changing sex.&lt;ref name='Warner R'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The reproductive biology of the Protogynous hermaphrodite Pimelometopon Pulchrum (Pisces: Labridae). | journal=Fishery Bulletin | year=1975 | first=R.R | last=Warner | volume=73 | pages=261–283| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thalassoma bifasciatum|Blue-headed wrasse]] begin life as males or females, but females can change sex and function as males. Young females and males start with a distinct coloration known as the "Initial Phase" before progressing into the "Terminal Phase" coloration, which has a change in intensity of color, stripes, and bars. Initial Phase males have larger [[testes]] than larger, terminal phase males, which enables the initial phase males to produce a large amount of sperm. This strategy is able to compete with that of the larger male, who is able to guard his own harem.

===Ultimate causes===

The [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]] of a biological phenomenon concerns why that phenomenon makes organisms better adapted to their environment, and thus why evolution by natural selection has produced that phenomenon. This is in contrast to proximate causes, which concern the molecular and physiological mechanisms that produce the phenomenon. A number of ultimate causes of hermaphroditism have been proposed, of which two are most relevant to sequential hermaphroditism.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=1969 | first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | last=Ghiselin | volume=44 | pages=189–208| id=| pmid=4901396 | issue=2 | doi=10.1086/406066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'size-advantage model' states that individuals of a given sex reproduce more effectively if they are a certain size or age. To create selection for sequential hermaphroditism, small individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as one sex and larger individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as the opposite sex. For example, eggs are larger than sperm, thus larger individuals are able to make more eggs, so individuals could maximize their reproductive potential by beginning life as male and then turning female upon achieving a certain size.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequential hermaphroditism can also protect against inbreeding in populations of organisms that have low enough motility and/or are sparsely distributed enough that there is a considerable risk of siblings encountering each other after reaching sexual maturity, and interbreeding. If siblings are all the same or similar ages, and if they all begin life as one sex and then transition to the other sex at about the same age, then siblings are highly likely to be the same sex at any given time. This should dramatically reduce the likelihood of inbreeding. Both protandry and protogyny are known to help prevent inbreeding in plants,{{cn|date=October 2018}} and many examples of sequential hermaphroditism attributable to inbreeding prevention have been identified in a wide variety of animals.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[ectotherms]] body size and female fecundity are positively correlated.&lt;ref name='Warner'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Adaptive Significance of Sequential Hermaphroditism in Animals. | journal=The American Naturalist | year=1975 | first=R. R. | last=Warner | volume=109 | pages=61–82| id=| doi=10.1086/282974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the size-advantage model. Kazancioglu and Alonzo (2010) performed the first comparative analysis of sex change in [[Labridae]]. Their analysis supports the size-advantage model and suggest that sequential hermaphroditism is correlated to the size-advantage. They determined that [[dioecy]] was less likely to occur when the size advantage is stronger than other advantages&lt;ref name='Alonzo'&gt;{{cite journal | title=A comparative analysis of sex change in Labridae supports the size advantage hypothesis | journal=Evolution; international journal of organic evolution | year=2010 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=64 | pages=2254–64| id=| pmid=20394662 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01016.x | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warner suggests that selection for protandry may occur in populations where female fecundity is augmented with age and individuals mate randomly. Selection for protogyny may occur where there are traits in the population that depress male fecundity at early ages (territoriality, mate selection or inexperience) and when female fecundity is decreased with age, the latter seems to be rare in the field.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; An example of territoriality favoring protogyny occurs when there is a need to protect their habitat and being a large male is advantageous for this purpose. In the mating aspect, a large male has a higher chance of mating, while this has no effect on the female mating fitness.&lt;ref name='Alonzo'/&gt; Thus, he suggests that female fecundity has more impact on sequential hermaphroditism than the age structures of the population.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt;

The size-advantage model predicts that sex change would only be absent if the relationship between size/age with reproductive potential is identical in both sexes. With this prediction one would assume that hermaphroditism is very common, but this is not the case. Sequential hermaphroditism is very rare and according to scientists this is due to some cost that decreases fitness in sex changers as opposed to those who don’t change sex. Some of the hypotheses proposed for the dearth of hermaphrodites are the energetic cost of sex change, genetic and/or physiological barriers to sex change, and sex-specific mortality rates.&lt;ref name='Warner' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Charnov'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Size Advantage May Not Always Favor Sex Change | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=1986 | first=E | last=Charnov | volume=119 | pages=283–285| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80141-2| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Munday'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The energetic cost of protogynous versus protandrous sex change in the bi-directional sex changing fish Gobiodon histrio | journal=Marine Biology | year=2002 | first=P | last=Munday|author2=BW Molony  | volume=141 | pages=429–446| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1007/s00227-002-0904-8| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kazanciglu and Alonzo found that dioecy was only favored when the cost of changing sex was very large. This indicates that the cost of sex change does not explain the rarity of sequential hermaphroditism by itself.&lt;ref name='Kazancioğlu'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Costs of changing sex do not explain why sequential hermaphroditism is rare | journal=The American Naturalist | year=2009 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=173 | pages=327–36| id=| pmid=19199519 | doi=10.1086/596539 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximate causes===

Many studies have focused on the proximate causes of sequential hermaphroditism. The role of [[aromatase]] has been widely studied in this area. Aromatase is an [[enzyme]] that controls the [[androgen]]/[[estrogen]] ratio in animals by catalyzing the conversion of [[testosterone]] into [[oestradiol]], which is irreversible. It has been discovered that the aromatase pathway mediates sex change in both directions.&lt;ref name='Kroon'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aromatase pathway mediates sex change in each direction. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2005 | first=F.

One such study was performed by Kobayashi et al. In their study they tested the role of estrogens in male three-spot wrasses (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''). They discovered that fish treated with aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight, plasma estrogen level and spermatogonial proliferation in the testis as well as increased androgen levels. Their results suggest that estrogens are important in the regulation of [[spermatogenesis]] in this protogynous hermaphrodite.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Role of estrogen in spermatogenesis in initial phase males of the three-spot wrasse (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''): wffect of aromatase inhibitor on the testis. | journal=Developmental Dynamics | year=2011 | first=y | last=Kobayashi |author2=Nozu R |author3=Nakamura M.  | volume=240 | pages=116–121| id=| url=https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650344417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=847189402b2dcdb18259e2dc89206111 | accessdate=2011-04-27 | doi=10.1002/dvdy.22507 | pmid=21117145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic consequences===

Sequential hermaphrodites almost always have a sex ratio biased towards the birth sex, and consequently experience significantly more reproductive success after switching sexes. In theory, this should decrease [[genetic diversity]] and [[effective population size]] (Ne). However, a study of two ecologically similar [[Cheimerius|santer sea bream]] ([[gonochoric]]) and [[Chrysoblephus puniceus|slinger sea bream]] (protogynous) in South African waters found that genetic diversities were similar in the two species, and while Ne was lower in the instant for the sex-changer, they were similar over a relatively short time horizion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coscia |first1=I. |last2=Chopelet|first2=J. |last3=Waples|first3=R.

=== Flowering plants ===
[[File:Aeonium protandry.jpg|thumb|Protandrous flowers of ''[[Aeonium undulatum]]'']]
In the context of the [[plant sexuality]] of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: '''''protogyny'''''&amp;mdash;female function precedes male function&amp;mdash;and '''''protandry'''''&amp;mdash;male function precedes female function.

Historically, dichogamy has been regarded as a mechanism for reducing [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=Darwin1862&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |title=On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1862 |url=http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215011429/http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of the angiosperms found that [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] (SI) plants, which are incapable of inbreeding, were as likely to be dichogamous as were self-compatible (SC) plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2445372 |author=Bertin, R.I. |title=Incidence of monoecy and dichogamy in relation to self-fertilization in angiosperms |journal=Am. J. Bot. |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=557–60 |year=1993 |jstor=2445372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led to a reinterpretation of dichogamy as a more general mechanism for reducing the impact of [[pollen]]-[[Carpel|pistil]] interference on pollen import and export.&lt;ref name=LloydWebb1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd, D. G., Webb, C. J. |title=The avoidance of interference between the presentation of pollen and  stigmas in angiosperms: I. Dichogamy |journal=New Zeal. J.

Unlike the [[inbreeding avoidance]] hypothesis, which focused on female function, this interference-avoidance hypothesis considers both reproductive functions.

In many hermaphroditic species, the close physical proximity of [[anthers]] and  [[Carpel|stigma]] makes interference unavoidable, either within a  [[flower]] or between  flowers on an  [[inflorescence]]. Within-flower interference, which occurs when either the  pistil interrupts pollen removal or the  anthers prevent pollen deposition, can result in autonomous or facilitated self-pollination.&lt;ref name=LloydSchoen1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/297040 |author=Lloyd, D.

The length of stigmatic receptivity plays a key role in regulating the isolation of the male and female stages in dichogamous plants, and stigmatic receptivity can be influenced by both temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=Lora&gt;{{cite journal | title=Stigmatic receptivity in a dichogamous early-divergent angiosperm species, ''Annona cherimola'' (Annonaceae): Influence of temperature and humidity. | journal=American Journal of Botany | year=2011 | first=J. | last=Lora |author2=Herrero, M. |author3=Hormaza, J.

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Government-run family planning programs first began in the 1950s{{Where|date=June 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Visaria_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | last2 = Jejeebhoy | first2 = Shireen | last3 = Merrick | first3 = Tom | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1999 | title = From Family Planning to Reproductive Health: Challenges Facing India | jstor = 2991871 | journal = International Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 25 | pages = S44–S49 | doi=10.2307/2991871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main objectives of these programs were often centered around population control for economic growth and development.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter_1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledbetter R | title = Thirty years of family planning in India | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 736–58 | date = 1984 | pmid = 11616645 | doi = 10.2307/2644186 | jstor = 2644186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[International Conference on Population and Development|International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)]] in Cairo, Egypt marked a significant shift in perspective in regards to reproductive health and is considered to be the birth of the modern SRHR movement.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glasier A, Gülmezoglu AM, Schmid GP, Moreno CG, Van Look PF | title = Sexual and reproductive health: a matter of life and death | journal = Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9547 | pages = 1595–607 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17084760 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69478-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the conference, debates surrounding family planning shifted from that of economics to that of public health and human rights.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fincher RA | title = International Conference on Population and Development | url = https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/envpola24&amp;id=309 | journal = Environmental Policy and Law | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | date = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Program of Action (PoA) was developed by the end of the ICPD and was approved and adopted by 179 countries.&lt;ref name="ICPD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Programme of Action | url = https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/programme_of_action_Web%20ENGLISH.pdf | work = International Conference on Population and Development | location = Cairo | date = September 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PoA affirmed sexual and reproductive health as a universal human right and outlined global goals and objectives for improving reproductive heath based around central themes of free choice, women's empowerment, and viewing sexual and reproductive health in terms of physical and emotional well-being.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; The PoA outlined a series of goals, based on a central mission of achieving universal access to reproductive health worldwide, that were aimed to be accomplished by 2015.&lt;ref name="Abrejo_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrejo FG, Shaikh BT, Saleem S | title = ICPD to MDGs: Missing links and common grounds | journal = Reproductive Health | volume = 5 | pages = 4 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18783600 | pmc = 2546384 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4755-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]] were developed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs JD, McArthur JW | title = The Millennium Project: a plan for meeting the Millennium Development Goals | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9456 | pages = 347–53 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15664232 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(05)17791-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and although reproductive health was not explicitly stated as one of the goals, it became an important component to Goals 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;  In 2010, the original PoA was revisited by the [[United Nations]] and updated to reflect their objective of achieving universal reproductive health care by 2015.&lt;ref name="ICPD" /&gt; When the MDGs and ICPD PoA phased out in 2015, the next objectives for SRHR were folded into the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], the next iteration of the MDGs which outline objectives to combat poverty through 2030.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tangcharoensathien V, Mills A, Palu T | title = Accelerating health equity: the key role of universal health coverage in the Sustainable Development Goals | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 13 | pages = 101 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25925656 | pmc = 4415234 | doi = 10.1186/s12916-015-0342-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

==Sexual rights==
Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The right to life, liberty and security of the person
# The right to autonomy and bodily integrity
# The right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

Aalegra said "things didn't really work out with [Sony Sweden], but I'm glad I had the opportunity to be exposed to the industry at a young age."&lt;ref name="interviewmagazine"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brara |first1=Noor |title=Discovery: Snoh Aalegra - Interview Magazine |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discover-snoh-aalegra |website=Interview Magazine |accessdate=12 October 2018 |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shouneyia |first1=Alexa |title=Snoh Aalegra Talks New Album 'Feels,' Working With No I.D. &amp; the Best Advice She Received From Prince |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8014782/snoh-aalegra-interview-new-album-feels-prince-no-id |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Aalegra began working on her debut album for Mamia Music, though [[Universal Music Sweden]].&lt;ref name="finest.se"/&gt; Aalegra began her music career as Sheri, with the release of her debut single, "Hit And Run" on 16 February 2009, with production by [[Andreas Carlsson]]. The single peaked at number 12 on the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish Single Charts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hung |first1=Steffen |title=swedishcharts.com - Sheri - Hit And Run |url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sheri&amp;titel=Hit+And+Run&amp;cat=s |website=swedishcharts.com |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalegra released her second single "U Got Me Good" on 4 December 2009, which peaked at number 2 on the Swedish Single Charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hung |first1=Steffen |title=swedishcharts.com - Sheri - U Got Me Good |url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sheri&amp;titel=U+Got+Me+Good&amp;cat=s |website=swedishcharts.com |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2010, Aalegra release her first studio album ''First Sign'', which features a cover of the 1984 song, "[[Smooth Operator]]" by [[Sade (band)|Sade]]. The album also includes her first two single, "Hit And Run" and "U Got Me Good".&lt;ref name="first-sign"/&gt;

===2014–present: Debut as Snoh Aalegra, ''Feels''===
In July 2014, Aalegra debut her new name, Snoh Aalegra, and appeared on [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s tenth studio album, ''[[Nobody's Smiling]]''. She released her debut EP, ''There Will Be Sunshine'' on 17 November 2014 through [[Epic Records]]. The EP includes "Bad Things" featuring [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and "Stockholm, Pt. II (Outro)" featuring [[Cocaine 80s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=There Will Be Sunshine - EP by Snoh Aalegra |url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/there-will-be-sunshine-ep/938986790 |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2015, Aalegra released her first single as Snoh Aalegra, "Emotional", with production by [[RZA]]. She also appeared on [[Vince Staples]]' ''[[Summertime '06]]'' in June 2015, providing vocals for the song "Jump Off the Road".

Aalegra signed with [[No I.D.]]'s [[No I.D.#ARTium Recordings|ARTium Recordings]] in 2016 and released an EP, ''Don't Explain'' on 8 April 2016, with features and production from [[James Fauntleroy]], [[No I.D.]], [[Boi-1da]], [[Christian Rich]] and [[DJ Dahi]]. The EP features a cover of the 1944 song, "[[Don't Explain (song)#Notable cover versions|Don't Explain]]" by [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Arthur Herzog Jr.]].

In 2017, Aalegra released her debut album, ''Feels'', with features from [[Vince Staples]], [[Vic Mensa]], and [[Timbuktu (musician)|Timbuktu]]. Her song from the album, "Time" was sampled on [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]’s ''[[More Life]]'' song "Do Not Disturb"&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; and on September 12, 2018, her song "Nothing Burns Like the Cold" featuring Vince Staples, was used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for their [[iPhone XS]] announcement video and commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone XS — Illusion — Apple |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96MQKwwHOE |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPhone XS TV Commercial, 'Illusion' Song by Snoh Aalegra, Vince Staples |url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/djH1/apple-iphone-xs-illusion-song-by-snoh-aalegra |website=iSpot.tv |accessdate=7 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sporic meiosis.svg|thumb|300px|Spores produced in a sporic life cycle.]]

Inset shows the surrounding, black poplars growing on sandy [[loam]] on the bank of a [[bog pond|kolk]], with the detail area marked.]]

In [[biology]], a '''spore''' is a unit of [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] or [[asexual reproduction]] that may be adapted for [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of many [[plant]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/searchresults.html?cx=009557456284541951685%3A50nf_5tpvuq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=spore&amp;sa=Search Tree Of Life Web Project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial spore]]s are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. [[Myxozoa]]n spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.&lt;ref&gt;"Myxozoa." Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].

The spores of [[seed plant]]s, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.

==Definition==
The term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word σπορά ''spora'', meaning "[[seed]], sowing", related to σπόρος ''sporos'', "sowing," and σπείρειν ''speirein'', "to sow."

In common parlance, the difference between a "spore" and a "[[gamete]]" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.

The main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.

==Classification of spore-producing organisms==
===Plants===
[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. 

Heterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Isoëtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a "female" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a "male". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.

===Fungi===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are [[diploid]] cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.

==Classification of spores==
Spores can be classified in several ways:

===By spore-producing structure===
[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]
[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]
[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]
====Fungi====
In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular [[taxon]] of the [[fungi]].
* '''[[Sporangiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[sporangium]] in many fungi such as [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Zygospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[zygosporangium]], characteristic of [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Ascospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[ascus]], characteristic of [[ascomycete]]s.
* '''[[Basidiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[basidium]], characteristic of [[basidiomycete]]s.
* '''[[Aeciospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[aecium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Urediniospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[uredinium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Teliospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[telium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Oospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[oogonium]], characteristic of [[oomycete]]s.
====Red algae====
* '''[[Carpospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[carposporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].
* '''[[Tetraspore]]s''': spores produced by a [[tetrasporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].

===By function===
* '''[[Chlamydospore]]s''': thick-walled resting spores of [[fungi]] produced to survive unfavorable conditions.
* '''[[Fungal infection in plants|Parasitic fungal spores]]''' may be classified into internal spores, which germinate within the host, and external spores, also called environmental spores, released by the host to infest other hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |title=Microsporidia (Protozoa): A Handbook of Biology and Research Techniques |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626082941/http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |archivedate=26 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}. modares.ac.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===By origin during life cycle===
* '''Meiospores''': spores produced by [[meiosis]]; they are thus [[haploid]], and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of [[gametophyte]]s of [[seed plant]]s found in [[flower]]s ([[angiosperm]]s) or [[Conifer cone|cones]] ([[gymnosperm]]s), and the [[zoospore]]s produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''.
** '''[[Microspore]]s''': meiospores that give rise to a male [[gametophyte]], ([[pollen]] in seed plants).
** '''[[Megaspore]]s''' (or '''macrospores'''): meiospores that give rise to a female [[gametophyte]], (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the [[ovule]]).
* '''[[conidium|Mitospores]]''' (or '''conidia''', '''conidiospores'''): spores produced by [[mitosis]]; they are characteristic of [[Ascomycetes]]. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called "mitosporic fungi" or "anamorphic fungi", and are previously classified under the [[taxon]] [[Deuteromycota]] (See [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph]]).

===By mobility===
Spores can be differentiated by whether they can [[motility|move]] or not.
* '''[[Zoospore]]s''': mobile spores that move by means of one or more [[flagellum|flagella]], and can be found in some [[algae]] and [[fungi]].
* '''[[Aplanospore]]s''': immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella.
* '''[[Autospore]]s''': immobile spores that cannot develop flagella.
* '''[[Ballistospore]]s''': spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal [[fruiting body]] as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most [[basidiospore]]s are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus ''[[Pilobolus]]''.
* '''[[Statismospore]]s''': spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are [[puffball]]s.

==Anatomy==
Under high [[magnification]], spores can be categorized as either '''monolete spores''' or '''trilete spores'''. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.

==Dispersal==
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]

In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.&lt;ref name="Trail"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].&lt;ref name="Pringle et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].

In Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Lönnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length.

In the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.

In the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophylla | work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7795">'''Sporogenesis''' is the production of [[spore]]s in [[biology]]. The term is also used to refer to the process of [[reproduction]] via spores. Reproductive spores were found to be formed in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms, such as [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], during their normal reproductive [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Dormant spores are formed, for example by certain fungi and algae, primarily in response to unfavorable growing conditions. Most eukaryotic spores are [[haploid]] and form through cell division, though some types are [[diploid]] or [[dikaryon]]s and form through cell fusion.

== Reproduction via spores ==
Reproductive spores are generally the result of cell division, most commonly [[meiosis]] (e.g. in plant [[sporophyte]]s). Sporic meiosis is needed to complete the sexual life cycle of the organisms using it.

In some cases, sporogenesis occurs via [[mitosis]] (e.g. in some fungi and algae). Mitotic sporogenesis is a form of [[asexual reproduction]]. Examples are the [[Conidium|conidial fungi]] ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'', for which mitospore formation appears to be the primary mode of reproduction. Other fungi, such as [[ascomycete]]s, utilize both mitotic and meiotic spores. The red alga ''[[Polysiphonia]]'' alternates between mitotic and meiotic sporogenesis and both processes are required to complete its complex reproductive life cycle.

In the case of dormant spores in eukaryotes, sporogenesis often occurs as a result of [[fertilization]] or [[karyogamy]] forming a diploid spore equivalent to a [[zygote]]. Therefore, zygospores are the result of [[sexual reproduction]].

Reproduction via spores involves the spreading of the spores by water or air. Algae and some fungi ([[chytrids]]) often use motile [[zoospore]]s that can swim to new locations before developing into sessile organisms. Airborne spores are obvious in fungi, for example when they are released from [[puffball]]s. Other fungi have more active spore dispersal mechanisms. For example, the fungus ''[[Pilobolus]]'' can shoot its sporangia towards light. Plant spores designed for [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] are also referred to as [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]]s. Plant spores are most obvious in the reproduction of [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es. However, they also exist in [[flowering plant]]s where they develop hidden inside the flower. For example, the [[pollen grain]]s of flowering plants develop out of microspores produced in the [[anther]]s.

Reproductive spores grow into multicellular haploid individuals or [[sporeling]]s. In [[heterosporous]] organisms, two types of spores exist: microspores give rise to males and megaspores to females. In [[homosporous]] organisms, all spores look alike and grow into individuals carrying reproductive parts of both genders.

== Formation of reproductive spores ==
Sporogenesis occurs in reproductive structures termed [[Sporangium|sporangia]]. The process involves sporogenous cells (sporocytes, also called spore mother cells) undergoing cell division to give rise to spores.

In meiotic sporogenesis, a diploid spore mother cell within the sporangium undergoes meiosis, producing a tetrad of haploid spores. In organisms that are [[heterosporous]], two types of spores occur: Microsporangia produce [[male]] microspores, and megasporangia produce [[female]] megaspores. In megasporogenesis, often three of the four spores degenerate after meiosis, whereas in microsporogenesis all four microspores survive.

In [[gymnosperm]]s, such as [[conifer]]s, microspores are produced through meiosis from microsporocytes in [[Strobilus|microstrobili]] or male cones. In [[flowering plant]]s, microspores are produced in the [[anther]]s of flowers. Each anther contains four [[Pollen#The structure and formation of pollen|pollen sacs]], which contain the microsporocytes. After meiosis, each microspore undergoes mitotic cell division, giving rise to multicellular [[pollen grain]]s (six nuclei in gymnosperms, three nuclei in flowering plants).

Megasporogenesis occurs in [[Strobilus|megastrobili]] in conifers (for example a pine cone) and inside the [[ovule]] in the flowers of flowering plants. A megasporocyte inside a megasporangium or ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four megaspores. Only one is a functional megaspore whereas the others stay dysfunctional or degenerate. The megaspore undergoes several mitotic divisions to develop into a female [[gametophyte]] (for example the seven-cell/eight-nuclei [[embryo sac]] in flowering plants).

=== Mitospore formation ===
Some fungi and algae produce [[mitospore]]s through mitotic cell division within a sporangium. In fungi, such mitospores are referred to as [[conidia]].

== Formation of dormant spores ==
Some algae, and fungi form [[resting spore]]s made to survive unfavorable conditions. Typically, changes in the environment from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions will trigger a switch from [[asexual reproduction]] to [[sexual reproduction]] in these organisms. The resulting spores are protected through the formation of a thick [[cell wall]] and can withstand harsh conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures. Examples are [[chlamydospore]]s, [[teliospore]]s, [[zygospore]]s, and [[Myxococcus xanthus|myxospores]]. Similar survival structures produced in some [[bacteria]] are known as [[endospore]]s.
 
=== Chlamydospore and teliospore formation ===
[[Chlamydospore]]s are generally multicellular, asexual structures. [[Teliospore]]s are a form of chlamydospore produced through the fusion of cells or [[hyphae]] where the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of the fused cells stay separate. These nuclei undergo [[karyogamy]] and meiosis upon germination of the spore.

=== Zygospore, oospore and auxospore formation ===
[[Zygospore]]s are formed in certain fungi ([[zygomycota]], for example ''[[Rhizopus]]'') and some algae (for example ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''). The zygospore forms through the [[Isogamy|isogamic]] fusion of two cells (motile single cells in ''Chlamydomonas'') or sexual [[Sexual conjugation|conjugation]] between two hyphae (in zygomycota). [[Plasmogamy]] is followed by [[karyogamy]], therefore zygospores are diploid ([[zygote]]s). They will undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating.

In [[oomycete]]s, the zygote forms through the fertilization of an egg cell with a sperm nucleus and enters a resting stage as a diploid, thick-walled [[oospore]]. The germinating oospore undergoes mitosis and gives rise to diploid hyphae which reproduce asexually via mitotic zoospores as long as conditions are favorable.

In [[diatom]]s, fertilization gives rise to a zygote termed [[auxospore]]. Besides sexual reproduction and as a resting stage, the function of an auxospore is the restoration of the original cell size, as diatoms get progressively smaller during mitotic cell division. Auxospores divide by mitosis.

=== Endospore formation ===
The term sporogenesis can also refer to [[endospore]] formation in [[bacteria]], which allows the cells to survive unfavorable conditions. Endospores are not reproductive structures and their formation does not require cell fusion or division. Instead, they form through the production of an encapsulating spore coat within the spore-forming cell.

== Parts of the spore ==
There are many parts of the spore 'plant'. The case that holds all the spores is called a sporangium.

'''Tierra''' is a [[computer simulation]] developed by [[ecologist]] [[Thomas S. Ray]] in the early 1990s in which [[computer program]]s compete for time (central processing unit ([[Central processing unit|CPU]]) time) and space (access to [[main memory]]). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be [[evolvability|evolvable]] and can [[mutation|mutate]], [[self-replication|self-replicate]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombine]]. Tierra's virtual machine is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=What this Program is|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#What|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=Available instructions|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#Idt|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).

== Simulations ==
The basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore ''[[in silico]]'' the basic processes of [[evolution]]ary and [[ecology|ecological]] dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of [[punctuated equilibrium]], [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] [[co-evolution]] and density-dependent [[natural selection]] are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of [[evolutionary computation]], such as [[genetic algorithm]]s, is that there is no explicit, or [[exogenous]] [[fitness (biology)|fitness function]] built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being "optimized"; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.

According to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more "open-ended" evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see [[evolvability]]), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to 'evolve'. The issue of how true [[open-ended evolution]] can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of [[artificial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedau M.A., McCaskill J.S. et al., "Open problems in artificial life", ''Artificial Life'', 2000 Fall '''6'''(4):363-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Bedau]] and [[Norman Packard]] developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau ''et al.'' applied these statistics to Evita, an [[Artificial life]] model similar to Tierra and [[Avida]], but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bedau, M.A., Snyder, E., Brown, C.T. and Packard, N.H. 1997, "A Comparison of Evolutionary Activity in Artificial Evolving Systems and in the Biosphere", in ''Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life'', Husbands and Harvey (eds), MIT press, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell K. Standish]] has measured the informational complexity of Tierran 'organisms', and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, R.K. 2003 "Open-ended artificial evolution", ''International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications 3(2)'', 167-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Tierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional [[mathematical model]]s, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see [[systems biology]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1351">"'''What the Dead Men Say'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[Worlds of Tomorrow (magazine)|Worlds of Tomorrow]]'' magazine in June 1964. The manuscript, originally titled "Man With a Broken Match", was received by Dick's agent on 15 April 1963.

==Plot summary==
[[Death]] is followed by a period of '[[half-life]]', a short amount of time which can be rationed out over long periods in which the dead can be revived—so that, potentially, they can 'live' on for a long time. When attempts to bring back important businessman Louis Sarapis fail, it's clearly more than mere negligence. Sure enough, Sarapis starts speaking from beyond the grave. From [[outer space]], in fact. Yet no-one seems terribly bothered, other than those directly concerned in the plot mechanics. Eventually entire [[communications networks]] (phones, TV, radio) are blocked by Sarapis' broadcasts.

The concept of 'half-life' was used again and developed in Dick's 1969 novel ''[[Ubik]]'', which even re-uses a page of the novella verbatim.
