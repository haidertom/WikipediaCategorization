{{Elections}}

The '''2015 cash-for-votes scam''' was a South Indian [[political scandal]], the second scandal of its kind since the 2008 North Indian [[cash-for-votes scandal]]. The 2015 political scandal started off when the [[Telugu Desam Party]] Leaders of [[Telangana]] state were caught in a video footage, aired in the media, offering bribes to a nominated MLA for his vote in the 2015 elections of the [[Telangana Legislative Council]]. The Telugu Desam MLA [[Revanth Reddy]] was arrested by the Telangana Police when he was offering Rs. 50 [[lakh]]s to the nominated MLA Elvis Stephenson. Reddy was then presented before the court of justice and sent to jail. Similarly, the phone conversation, which was quoted as the voice of [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]], the [[Andhra Pradesh]] Chief Minister, with the same nominated MLA was aired in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;Rahul, U. (8 June 2015) [http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tv-channel-airs-naidumla-tape/article7292281.ece TV channel airs Naidu-MLA ‘tape’]. The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U. Sudhar Reddy (8 June 2015) [http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150608/nation-current-affairs/article/tv-channels-telacast-ap-cm-chandrababu-naidu%E2%80%99s-call-mla-elvis TV channels telacast AP CM Chandrababu Naidu’s call to MLA Elvis Stephenson]. Deccanchronicle.com. Retrieved on 18 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telugu Desam party alleged that the scandal, was a political vendetta, doctored by the Telangana State Government under the direction of [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao|K. Chandrashekhar Rao]], the Chief Minister of Telangana, alongside the [[YSR Congress Party]].But eventually proved as a false statement in investigation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-cash-for-vote-case-poll-alleged-bribe-an-audio-clip/|title=Cash-for-vote case explained: Poll, alleged bribe, an audio clip|date=10 June 2015|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further development, The [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] for the States of Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, granted bail to [[Revanth Reddy]] and two other co-accused due to lack of substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/cashforvote-case-hc-grants-bail-to-revanth-reddy/article7370014.ece|title=Revanth Reddy gets bail; ACB set to approach Supreme Court|author=V Rishi Kumar|work=The Hindu Business Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Events and allegations===
The elections for the Council of [[Telangana]] Assembly were initiated and the notification for six upper house seats were released. Five candidates from TRS, one from Congress and one from Telugu Desam got ready to contest the elections. The Telugu Desam and allied [[BJP]] together does not have enough votes to win the contest. Then the news came out that they were trying to get votes from other parties. The Party President Chandrababu Naidu conducted meetings to analyze this matter, based on his suggestion the TDP Party Leaders got into action. The rival parties have sensed that they are attempting to lure their MLA’s, so the respective party leaders became cautious. In this process a high drama took place at Stephenson’s place. The TDP MLA Revanth Reddy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Cash-for-vote-Scam-TDP-MLA-Revanth-Reddy-Gives-Murky-Twist-to-MLC-Poll/2015/06/01/article2843684.ece|title=Cash-for-vote Scam: TDP MLA Revanth Reddy Gives Murky Twist to MLC Poll|work=The New Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; met Stephenson with the help of an aide. Following Revanth’s suggestion this aide tried to deliver Rs.50 lakh currency bundles. The videos of Revanth Reddy during this transaction turned out to be critical and aired on TV News channels.

==Revanth Reddy conversation==
The video recording shows that Revanth Reddy spoke several matters with Stephenson. He mentioned that he is the active leader in Telangana and also said that his ‘Boss’ assigns crucial matters only to him. He assured that everything will be taken care by '''Boss'''. And mentioned that he reported about money matter. He stressed that everything is done based on Boss instruction. Authorities arrested Revanth Reddy and later the video was telecasted in media. Everyone understood that when a Party MLA refers someone as ‘Boss’ repeatedly, it may be none otherthan the Party President Chandrababu Naidu.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/cash-for-votes-case-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister-in-alleged-call-controversy-769579|title=Cash-for-Vote Case: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu in Controversy Over Alleged Phone Call|author=Uma Sudhir|date=7 June 2015|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stephenson arguments==
As per the arguments of nominated MLA Stephenson, it is coming to know that Chandrababu was the one who doctored the entire episode. The sequential events began on May 28 when one by name Mattaiah met Stephenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ap7am.com/lv-190841-stephenson-reveals-about-cash-for-vote-deal.html|title=Stephenson reveals about cash-for-vote deal|work=ap7am.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Mattaiah tried to offer cash in regard to MLC elections. But, Stephenson approached ACB authorities believing that it is unethical. Later Sebastian, another person from TDP and after him Revanth Reddy entered the course of events. On May 30 Sebastian along with Revanth Reddy went straight to Stephenson’s residence to negotiate the deal. The duo told him that a secret meeting with Chandrababu will be arranged. The same day evening they made him speak to Chandrababu over phone. Chandrababu assured him that he will take care of everything and mentioned that his persons informed him about the deal. He then assured him that the promises will be honored. The next day i.e., on May 31 Revanth Reddy along with his aides met Stephenson with cash. The ACB Authorities who were already on alert arrested Revanth Reddy.

==Alleged Chandrababu Naidu's (Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh) role==
When the Telugu Desam MLA Revanth Reddy got arrested everyone’s attention fell on the party’s activities. Already in Andhra Pradesh the Telugu Desam Party is facing allegations that it has bought several MPS, independent MLAs, local body leader, primarily in the Zilla parishad and mandal parishad elections, that the party has bribed MPTCs and ZPTCs to win Mandal president and ZP chairperson. Is it moving ahead with the same strategy in Telangana?, was the suspicion that spread out. In the meanwhile an audio tape came into light, stating that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Mr.Chandrababu Naidu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/leaked-recordings-in-cash-for-vote-case-hits-cm-chandrababu-naidu-where-it-hurts-the-most-2284310.html|title=Cash-for-vote case: Leaked tape recordings hit Chandrababu Naidu where it hurts most|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke to Stephenson. Based on what was aired in the TV news channels, Chandrababu Naidu had a phone conversation &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; with Stephenson which contains the message,** our men told me everything, I will look into your matter, promises will be honoured, I am with you, don’t bother, we will work together.

==Attempts to sidetrack the issue==
The Telugu Desam party has started damage control measures to handle the repeated broadcasting of the conversation in the TV news channels. To begin with, Chandrababu went to Delhi and met the top cadre leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150610/nation-current-affairs/article/cash-vote-scam-amid-controversy-chandrababu-naidu-meets|title=Cash-for-vote scam: Amid controversy, Chandrababu Naidu meets Narendra Modi|work=Deccan Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no favorable response from them, the Central Law Minister announced that they will not interfere in this matter. Governor Narsimhan also traveled to Delhi to submit a report on this matter. Outraged by this move the TDP Ministers and leaders started abusing the Governor; this became a hot topic of discussion. In the meanwhile the Telugu Desam aggravated emotions and anger throughout the State stating that this is a matter of prestige and dignity of Andhra Pradesh. They did propaganda that there is no safety to Andhra people in Hyderabad and demanded that Section-8 must be implemented in Hyderabad which was a common capital. To some extent this was successfully driven into the public. Surprisingly there is no word on Section-8 after the so believed truce accorded between two ruling parties.

==Chandrababu Naidu's course of action==
The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu took this seriously as discussions on this issue was propagating throughout the State. He focused all his attention on this matter for several days and conducted meetings and reviews with Police higher officials. He immediately sacked the then intelligence chief Mrs.Anuradha for failing to grab information about telangana ACB plans. The word spread rapidly that the chief initiator behind this scandal was Telugu Desam President Chandrababu Naidu after the arrest of Telugu Desam MLA Revanth Reddy in Cash for Vote &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/cash-vote-case-10-reasons-tdp-no-takers-battle-trs-2304552.html|title=Cash for vote case: 10 reasons why TDP has no takers in its battle with TRS|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; scandal. Though it is a matter concerned to the Party, Chandrababu took it as a matter of the Andhra Pradesh Government and deployed the government authorities to handle the issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10332">An '''administrative centre''' is a seat of regional administration or [[local government]], or a [[county town]], or the place where the central administration of a [[Township|commune]] is located.

In countries which have French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate ''capoluogo''), a '''chef-lieu''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛfljø}}, plural form ''chefs-lieux'' (literally "chief place" or "head place"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. 

==Algeria==
The capital of an [[provinces of Algeria|Algerian Province]] is called a '''chef-lieu'''. The capital of a [[districts of Algeria|district]], the next largest division, is also called a '''chef-lieu'''. While the capital of the lowest division, the [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]], is called '''agglomeration de chef-lieu''' (chef-lieu  [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]) and is abbreviated as '''A.C.L.'''

==Belgium==
The '''chef-lieu''' in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium]].  Three of these cities also give their name to their province ([[Antwerp]], [[Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]).

==Luxembourg==

Luxembourg is divided into two judicial [[arrondissement]]s (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]]s and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengen'').

Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a '''chef-lieu''' and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.

==France==
The '''chef-lieu of a [[departments of France|département]]''' is known as the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]''. This is the town or city where the [[prefect]] of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the [[prefecture]]. In every [[French region]], one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of ''Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…'' and the city where the regional prefect is found is known  as ''chef-lieu of the  region'' or,  more commonly, ''Regional prefecture''. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment.  

The '''chef-lieu of an [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]''', commonly known as the ''[[Subprefectures in France|sous-préfecture]]'' is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the [[sub-prefecture]]. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the ''Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture'', who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[cantons of France|canton]]''' is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it.  In past decades, there was always a [[Gendarmerie]], a treasurer and a justice of the peace.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[communes of France|commune]]''' is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.

==Jordan==
In the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the administrative centres are known as "chief towns" or [[Nahias of Jordan|''nahias'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (''qda''), a district (''liwa''), or a [[Governorates of Jordan|governorate]] (''muhafazah'').

==New Caledonia==
The '''chef-lieu''' indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So [[Nouméa]] is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So [[Wé]] is part of the town of [[Lifou]], but is the chef-lieu of Lifou.  In the [[Loyalty Islands]] and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.

==Francophone West Africa==
Many of the West African states which gained independence from [[France]] in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a ''Chief-Lieu''.  States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.‑P. (eds), 1998, "Les arènes locales face à la décentralisation et démocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural béninois", in Bierschenk T. &amp; Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le Bénin rural entre démocratisation et décentralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11‑51.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taking [[Communes of Niger|Niger]] and [[Communes of Mali|Mali]] as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu.  The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of [[French West Africa]], and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fay [La décentralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122].&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, [[Cercles of Mali]]/[[Departments of Niger]], and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bréhima Béridogo, [« Processus de Décentralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalisées », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for Mali, see Bréhima Kassibo, [« La Décentralisation au Mali : État des Lieux », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997  http://apad.revues.org/579]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chefs-lieux'' of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a "High Council of Collectivites" seated at the nation's capital.  Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a ''Place''/''Site'' (''Site'' in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the ''Chief-Place'' even at the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-17%20regime%20financier.pdf REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n° 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 déterminant le régime financier des Régions, des Départements et des Communes]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], the term is applied to the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]], which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the [[republics of Russia|republics]], for which the term "[[capital city|capital]]" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in [[Ukraine]].

==Switzerland==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is applied to the capital of each [[Swiss canton]].  In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.

==Tunisia==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is used to designate the capital of each  '''gouvernorat''' (department).  Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into '''delegations'''  (districts) which each have a central city as '''chef-lieu of delegation'''.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] it is the centre of a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]], which is distinct from a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic county]] with a county town.

==Popular culture==
* ''The Fiancée of the pirate'' (1969) is a film by [[Nelly Kaplan]], where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.

It was highly critical of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] and actively fought against what it considered [[social imperialism]]. In June 1979, RGPA convened the [[Mujahedin Freedom Fighters Front of Afghanistan]] together with Islamist elements, as a [[united front]] against the pro-Soviet government.

Along with some other Islamist groups, RGPA directed a rebellion in [[Kabul]] and other cities on August 5, 1979, that became known as the [[Bala Hissar uprising]]. The uprising was suppressed by the government and tens of ALO cadres were killed and arrested. Some of the central committee members like Mohammad Mohsin, Mohammad Dawod and others were executed in the [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]].

ALO had many fronts against the Soviets and pro-Soviet Afghan communists in different parts of Afghanistan and was attacked by both the Soviet forces and the fundamentalist groups of Mujahideen. They lost over 120 of its cadres during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a-l-o.maoism.ru/photos_s/martyred.htm Martyred Cadres of the Afghanistan Liberation Organization (ALO)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2016}}

===Decline===
Dr. Faiz Ahmad himself was assassinated on November 12, 1986, along with his 6 other comrades by the [[Islamic Party of Afghanistan|Hizb-e Islami]] militia of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].

==Current Status==
More recently, ALO has directed its energies towards opposing the American occupation of Afghanistan and the regime of President [[Hamid Karzai]].

'''Agonism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀγών ''agon'', "struggle") is a political theory that emphasizes the potentially positive aspects of certain (but not all) forms of political conflict. It accepts a permanent place for such conflict, but seeks to show how people might accept and channel this positively. For this reason, agonists are especially concerned with debates about [[democracy]]. The tradition is also referred to as '''agonistic pluralism'''.

==Agonism and other traditions in political thought==

Agonism is opposed to a strand in the [[Marxist]] conception of politics known as "[[materialism]]". [[Karl Marx|Marx]] would have agreed with the agonists that society had always been full of conflict, when he wrote: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;Marx &amp; Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', 1848, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm Chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the causes of conflict were inescapable features of present—i.e., [[capitalist]]—society. But, in his view, history would develop in such a way as to eventually destroy capitalism, and replace it with a harmonious society—which was his conception of communism. Especially during the 1960s and 1970s, many people, academics included, subscribed to a roughly Marxist analysis. Since then, some of those people have come to the view that the "[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]" does not give sufficient reason for hope about a harmonious society to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Mouffe]] and [[Ernesto Laclau]] are amongst those who have come to agonism from a background in Marxism and the social movements of the middle part of the last century.&lt;ref name="redpepper.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/XRADDEM.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantal Mouffe says, "I use the concept of agonistic pluralism to present a new way to think about democracy that is different from the traditional liberal conception of democracy as a negotiation among interests and is also different from the model that is currently being developed by people like [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. While they have many differences, Rawls and Habermas have in common the idea that the aim of the democratic society is the creation of a consensus, and that consensus is possible if people are only able to leave aside their particular interests and think as rational beings. However, while we desire an end to conflict, if we want people to be free we must always allow for the possibility that conflict may appear and to provide an arena where differences can be confronted. The democratic process should supply that arena."&lt;ref&gt; MOUFFE, C. (2000) The Democratic Paradox. London, New York. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agonism, not antagonism==
Agonism is not simply the undifferentiated celebration of [[wikt:Special:Search/antagonism|antagonism]]:
{{quote|Agonism implies a deep respect and concern for the other; indeed, the Greek ''agon'' refers most directly to an athletic contest oriented not merely toward victory or defeat, but emphasizing the importance of the struggle itself—a struggle that cannot exist without the opponent. Victory through forfeit or default, or over an unworthy opponent, comes up short compared to a defeat at the hands of a worthy opponent—a defeat that still brings honor. An agonistic discourse will therefore be one marked not merely by conflict but just as importantly, by mutual admiration...|Political theorist [[Samuel Chambers]]&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"&gt;[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=317]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Bonnie Honig]], an advocate of agonism, writes: "to affirm the perpetuity of the contest is not to celebrate a world without points of stabilisation; it is to affirm the reality of perpetual contest, even within an ordered setting, and to identify the affirmative dimension of contestation".&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Political Theory and the Displacement of Politics'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical conceptions==
The work of [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have also invoked conceptions of agonism and the agon in a more critical sense beyond that of political counter-hegemony. Although this usage of Agonism has been largely ignored it has been explored at some length by Claudio Colaguori in ''Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination''. For Colaguori, "the agon is literally the arena of competition, the scene of contest, and the locus of adversarial conflict. The philosophy of agonism affirms the idea that transcendence, truth, and growth are generated from the outcome of the contest...the concept of agonism is often understood in an affirmative sense as the generative principle of economy, society and even natural ecology and personal growth... The ambivalent character of agonism is that it is often seen as a mode of transcendence, while its instrumental relation to the mode of destruction is rarely acknowledged".&lt;ref&gt;"C Colaguori" Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination. de Sitter Publications, Whitby, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-897160-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agonism forms part of the instituted social order where society "produces and reproduces itself precisely from the interconnection of the antagonistic interests of its members" (Adorno, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Adorno, 1974, "Minima Moralia". London: Verso Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno, agonism is also about the "[[theodicy]] of conflict" where opponents "want to annihilate one another... to enter the agon, each the mortal enemy of each" (Minima Moralia). Adorno also sees agonism as the underlying principle in [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic of history]] where "dialectics (growth through conflict) is the [[ontology]] of the wrong state of things. The right state of things would be free of it: neither a system nor a contradiction" (Negative Dialectics). Colaguori reconstructs the concept of the agon to invoke this critical, destructive aspect as a way of extending Adorno's critique of modern domination and identify how the normalization and naturalization of conflict is used as an ideology to justify various forms of domination and subjugation. The agonistic ideology that has been appropriated by popular culture for example makes use of agonistic themes to celebrate competition as the wellspring of life in such a way as to normalize "a military definition of reality" (C. W. Mills).

The critical conception of agonism developed by Adorno and Foucault emphasizes how aspects of competition can be utilized to reinforce the project of domination that is evident in the geopolitics of modernity. Colaguori suggests that a critical conception of agonism can be applied to the study of "numerous forms of social conflict in gender, class and race relations where the competitive mode of interaction prevails in the formation of social hierarchies based on competition as a form of exclusion". Colaguori further states that, "after 100 years of technological progress, human societies are trapped in a perpetual dynamic of conflict and crisis, with modernization at a standstill. While this dialectic of development and destruction has been analysed from political and economic perspectives, Agon Culture offers an analysis of the human condition through an examination of the way in which the cultural ideology of competition operates as a mode of rationality that underpins the order of domination."

==Agonism in fiction==
The [[science fiction]] novel ''Lady of Mazes'' by [[Karl Schroeder]] depicts a post-human future where "agonistics" is the ruling principle of the solar system. The story explains agonistics as "You can compete, and you can win, but you can never win once-and-for-all". A character gives two examples of agonism: a presidency with [[term limit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and laws aimed at preventing corporate monopolies.&lt;ref name= "KSchroeder"&gt;Karl Schroeder ''Lady of Mazes'', Tor, {{ISBN|0-7653-1219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Sydney Porter by doubleday.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The phrase ''banana republic'' was coined in 1901 by the American writer [[O. Henry]] (William Sydney Porter, 1862–1910).]]

In [[political science]], the term '''banana republic''' describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, such as [[banana]]s or minerals. In 1901, the American author [[O. Henry]] coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under [[exploitation of natural resources|economic exploitation]] by U.S. corporations, such as the [[United Fruit Company]]. Typically, a banana republic has a society of extremely [[social stratification|stratified]] [[social class]]es, usually a large impoverished [[working class]] and a ruling-class [[plutocracy]], composed of the business, political and military elites of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Richard Alan White |title = The Morass.

In economics, a banana republic is a country with an economy of [[state capitalism]], by which economic model the country is operated as a [[private property|private]] commercial enterprise for the exclusive [[profit (economics)|profit]] of the ruling class. Such exploitation is enabled by collusion between the state and favored economic [[monopoly|monopolies]], in which the profit, derived from the private exploitation of public lands, is private property, while the debts incurred thereby are the financial responsibility of the public treasury. Such an imbalanced economy remains limited by the [[uneven and combined development|uneven economic development]] of town and country, and usually reduces the national [[currency]] into devalued [[banknote]]s (paper money), rendering the country ineligible for [[development aid|international development credit]].&lt;ref name=Hitchens &gt;{{cite magazine |author=[[Christopher Hitchens]] |title=America the Banana Republic |magazine=Vanity Fair |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/10/hitchens200810 |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Cover of Cabbages and Kings, 1904 edition.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Cover of ''[[Cabbages and Kings (literature)|Cabbages and Kings]]'' (1904 edition).]]
In the 19th century, the American writer [[O. Henry]] (William Sydney Porter, 1862–1910) coined the term ''banana republic'' to describe the fictional Republic of Anchuria in the book ''[[Cabbages and Kings (novel)|Cabbages and Kings]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[O. Henry]]|title=Cabbages and Kings|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Page &amp; Company]]|location=New York City|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jpMsL2T0CoC|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jpMsL2T0CoC&amp;q=%22banana+republic%22+Anchuria 132, 296]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of thematically related short stories inspired by his experiences in [[Honduras]], where he lived for six months until January 1897, hiding in a hotel in [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo, Colón]], when he was wanted in the U.S. for [[embezzlement]] from a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malcolm D.

In the early 20th century, the [[United Fruit Company]], a multinational American corporation, was instrumental to the creation of the banana republic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Peter | title = Jungle capitalists : a story of globalisation, greed and revolution | publisher = Canongate | location = Edinburgh New York | year = 2009 | page = 6 | isbn = 1847676863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nytimes.com/2008/03/02/books/review/Kurtz-Phelan-t.html Big Fruit], ''NY Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other American corporations, such as the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], and with occasional support from the United States government, the corporations created the political, economic, and social circumstances that established banana republics in Central American countries such as [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-16 Where did banana republics get their name?], ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The history of the ''banana republic'' began with the introduction of the [[banana]] fruit to the U.S. in 1870, by [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]], captain of the [[schooner]] ''Telegraph'', who bought bananas in Jamaica and sold them in Boston at a 1,000 percent profit.&lt;ref name=acker&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alison Acker |title=Honduras.

The Fate of the Fruit that Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSoVd-o8PmoC&amp;hl=en|publisher = Hudson Street Press|location = London|year=2008|pages=68 |id={{ISBN|1-59463-038-0}} |isbn=978-1-59463-038-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873,  to produce food for their railroad workers, the American railroad tycoons [[Henry Meiggs]] and his nephew, [[Minor C. Keith]], established [[banana plantation]]s along the railroads they built in Costa Rica; recognizing the profitability of exporting bananas, they began exporting the fruit to the Southeastern U.S.&lt;ref name="Koeppel-2008" /&gt;
[[File:Minor Keith.jpg|thumb|right|185px|The banana planter: [[Minor Cooper Keith|Minor C. Keith]], American businessman.]]
In the mid-1870s, to manage the new [[Agribusiness|industrial-agriculture]] business enterprise in the countries of [[Central America]], Keith founded the [[Tropical Trading and Transport Company]]: one-half of what would later become the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC); later [[Chiquita Brands International]], created in 1899 by merger with the [[Boston Fruit Company]], and owned by [[Andrew Preston]]. By the 1930s, the international political and economic tensions created by the United Fruit Company enabled the corporation to control 80–90 per cent of the banana business in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Acker63&gt;Alison Acker (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, three American [[multinational corporation]]s (the [[United Fruit Company]], the [[Standard Fruit Company]], and the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]]) dominated the cultivation, harvesting, and exportation of bananas, and controlled the road, rail, and port infrastructure of Honduras. In the northern coastal areas near the Caribbean Sea, the Honduran government ceded to the banana companies {{convert|500|ha/km|acre/mi}} of a laid railroad, despite there being neither passenger nor freight railroad service to Tegucigalpa, the capital city. Among the Honduran people, the United Fruit Company was known as ''El pulpo'' (The Octopus), because its influence pervaded Honduran society, controlled their country's transport infrastructure, and sometimes manipulated Honduran national politics with anti-labor violence.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{Cite book |author=Peter Chapman |title=Bananas. How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-azAAAAIAAJ |publisher=[[Canongate Books|Canongate]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |year = 2007|pages=102 |id={{ISBN|1-84195881-6}} |isbn=978-1-84195-881-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, despite the UFC [[monopoly]], the [[Vaccaro Brothers]] established the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later the [[Dole Food Company]]) to export Honduran bananas to the U.S. port of New Orleans. The fruit-exporting corporations kept U.S. prices low by [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalistic]]  manipulation of Latin American national [[land use]] laws to cheaply buy large tracts of prime agricultural land for corporate banana plantations in the republics of the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Central America|Central American isthmus]], and tropical South America; the American fruit companies then employed the dispossessed Latin American natives as low-wage employees.&lt;ref name="Koeppel-2008" /&gt;

By the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest landowner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors confirming the suitability of the phrase Banana Republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5jDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=United+Fruit+company+Banana+republics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnh8TCgdPVAhWr7oMKHdOqCHQ4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=United+Fruit+company+Banana+republics&amp;f=false|title=America's Backyard: The United States and Latin America from the Monroe Doctrine to the War on Terror|first=Grace|last=Livingstone|date=4 April 2013|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
[[File:CLeePic.jpg|thumb|200px|In 1912, for the Cuyamel Fruit Company, the American mercenary "General" [[Lee Christmas]] overthrew the civil government of Honduras to install a military government friendly to foreign business.]]

In the early 20th century, the American businessman [[Sam Zemurray]] (founder of the Cuyamel Fruit Company) was instrumental to establishing the "banana republic" stereotype, when he entered the banana-export business by buying overripe bananas from the United Fruit Company to sell in New Orleans. In 1910, Zemurray bought 6,070 hectares (15,000 acres) in the Caribbean coast of Honduras for exploitation by the Cuyamel Fruit Company. In 1911, Zemurray conspired with [[Manuel Bonilla]], an ex-president of Honduras (1904–07), and the American mercenary Gen. [[Lee Christmas]], to overthrow the civil government of Honduras and install a military government friendly to foreign businessmen.

To that end, the mercenary army of the Cuyamel Fruit Company, led by Gen. Christmas, effected a ''[[coup d'état]]'' against President [[Miguel R. Dávila]] (1907–11) and installed General [[Manuel Bonilla]] (1912–13). The U.S. ignored the [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of the elected government of Honduras by a private army, justified by the U.S. State Department's misrepresenting President Dávila as too politically liberal and a poor businessman whose management had indebted Honduras to Great Britain, a geopolitically unacceptable circumstance in light of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. The ''coup d'état'' was consequence of the Dávila government's having slighted the Cuyamel Fruit Company by colluding with the rival United Fruit Company to award them a monopoly contract for the Honduran banana, in exchange for the UFC's brokering of U.S.government loans to Honduras.&lt;ref name=Acker63 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Darío A.

[[File:Honduras rel 1985.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Honduras, the quintessential banana republic.]]

The political instability consequent to the ''coup d'état'' stalled the Honduran economy, and the unpayable [[external debt]] (ca. US$4 billion) of the Republic of Honduras was excluded from access to international [[investment]] capital. That financial deficit perpetuated Honduran economic stagnation and perpetuated the image of Honduras as a banana republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W.S.

In the event, the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] became the legal-tender currency of Honduras; the mercenary Gen. Lee Christmas became commander of the Honduran army, and later was appointed [[Consul (representative)|U.S. Consul]] to the Republic of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=George Black |title=The Good Neighbor: How the United States Wrote the History of Central America and the Caribbean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvl6AAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City |year=1988 |pages=35 |id={{ISBN|0-39475965-6}} |isbn=978-0-394-75965-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, 23 years later, after much corporate intrigue among the American businessmen, by means of a [[takeover|hostile takeover]] of agricultural business interests, Sam Zemurray assumed control of the rival United Fruit Company, in 1933.&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

===Guatemala===
[[File:LocationGuatemala.svg|300px|right]]
[[Guatemala]] suffered the regional socio-economic legacy of the ''banana republic'': inequitably distributed agricultural land and natural wealth, [[Uneven and combined development|uneven economic development]], and an economy dependent upon a few export crops—usually bananas, coffee, and sugar cane. The inequitable land distribution was an important cause of national poverty, and the concomitant sociopolitical discontent and [[civil war|insurrection]]. Almost 90 percent of the country's farms are too small to yield adequate subsistence harvests to the farmers, while two percent of the country's farms occupy 65 percent of the arable land, the property of the local [[oligarchy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

During the 1950s, the United Fruit Company sought to convince the governments of U.S. Presidents [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] (1945–53) and [[Dwight D.

===Poetry===
[[File:Pablo Neruda.jpg|thumb|right|175px|With the poem "La United Fruit Co.", [[Pablo Neruda]] denounced the corporate subjugation of Latin America.]]
In the book ''[[Canto General]]'' (General Song, 1950), the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] (1904–73) denounced foreign [[multinational corporation|multinational corporate]] political dominance of [[Latin America]]n countries with the four-stanza poem "La United Fruit Co."; the second-stanza excerpts read:&lt;ref&gt;George Black (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;The Fruit Company, Inc.&lt;br&gt;
Reserved for itself the most succulent,&lt;br&gt;
The central coast of my own land,&lt;br&gt;
The delicate waist of the Americas.

It rechristened its territories&lt;br&gt;
As the "Banana Republics", &lt;br&gt;
And over the sleeping dead,&lt;br&gt;
Over the restless heroes&lt;br&gt;
Who brought about the greatness,&lt;br&gt;
The liberty and the flags,&lt;br&gt;
It established a comic opera&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Literature===
The novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], depicts the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] capitalism of foreign fruit companies as voracious socio-economic [[exploitation of natural resources]] of Macondo and of the people. Domestically, the corrupt national government of Macondo abets the business policies and labor practices of the foreign corporations, which brutally oppress the workers.

The protagonist, José Arcadio Segundo, has been [[Labour union|organizing]] the workers of the banana plantations to jointly affect a work strike to protest the inhumane working conditions. Martial law is imposed upon Macondo, and the workers respond by sabotaging the banana plantations. In unexpected response, the national government diplomatically invites more than 3,000 workers to meet with provincial leaders to resolve their labor-and-management differences. The meeting is a deceit; the army surrounds the workers and methodically kill them with machine guns. Afterward, the three thousand corpses are collected onto a train and later dumped into the sea, to be forgotten.

Meanwhile, the apparently dead José Arcadio Segundo also was loaded onto the coast-bound train of corpses, yet later escapes and walks back to Macondo. To his horror, José Arcadio learns that all memory of the massacre has been eliminated, no-one in Macondo remembers the killing of three thousand workers. The townsfolk refuse to believe José Arcadio when he tells them of the massacre, which he survived. Moreover, nature contributes to the oblivion with heavy, unrelenting rain that destroys the physical traces of the massacred workers.

===Movies===

[[Woody Allen]]'s 1971 film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' depicted a fictional banana republic called San Marcos; the film is also named for this term.

Catalist's CEO is [[Laura Quinn]], an economic policy advisor in the U.S. Senate and former Deputy Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore. 

In August 2016, Catalist analyzed records from 10 [[battleground states]] through June and found a major influx of new voters, majority-white, were responsible for the record-breaking turnout in the Republican primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/donald-trumps-great-white-hope-is-fading-fast.html|title=Donald Trump’s Great White Hope Is Fading Fast|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/voter-influx-appears-missing-for-trump-1471912460|title=Voter Influx Appears Missing for Trump|last=Tau|first=ron|date=2016-08-23|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaboration between Catalist and [[SurveyMonkey]] showed that Sanders supporters voted less frequently and were less reliably Democratic than Clinton supporters.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Catalist served as the principal repository of Democratic data, working with over 90 liberal groups including the [[Service Employees International Union]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], and the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

It is fitting, therefore, to label this complex of ideas with his name. A similar rhetoric, according to some authorities also in response to a threat to traditional peasant economy, had emerged in China with the legalists, around the 4th century B.C.

He characterized the Catonist attitude as the reaction from rural aristocracy towards rapid political and economic changes:

{{quote|...The function of Catonism is too obvious to require more than brief comment.  It justifies a repressive social order that buttresses the position of those in power. It denies the existence of actual changes that have hurt the peasants. It denies the need for further social changes, especially revolutionary ones. Perhaps Catonism may also relieve the conscience of those most responsible for the damage - after all, military expansion destroyed the Roman peasantry.

Modern versions of Catonism arise too out of the adoption by the landed upper classes of repressive and exploitative methods in response to the increasing intrusion of market relationships into an agrarian economy...&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;}}

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

'''Clientelism''' is the exchange of goods and services for political support, often involving an implicit or explicit [[Quid pro quo|quid-pro-quo]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book  |isbn=978-1107660397 |title=Brokers, Voters, and Clientelism: The Puzzle of Distributive Politics |last1=Stokes |first1=Susan C |last2=Dunning |first2=Thad |last3=Nazareno |first3=Marcelo |last4=Brusco |first4=Valeria |date=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clientelism involves an asymmetric relationship between groups of political actors described as ''patrons, brokers'', and ''clients''. [[Richard Graham (historian)|Richard Graham]] has defined clientelism as a set of actions based on the principle ''take there, give here'', with the practice allowing both clients and patrons to gain advantage from the other's support. Moreover, clientelism is typified by "exchange systems where voters trade political support for various outputs of the public decision-making process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1753-9137.2010.01089.x |title = "Their Deeds are the Deeds of Zimri; but They Expect a Reward Like Phineas": Neoliberal and Multicultural Discourses in the Development of Israeli DTT Policy |journal = Communication, Culture &amp; Critique |volume = 4 |pages = 1–22 |year = 2011 |last1 = Davidson |first1 = Roei |last2 = Schejter |first2 = Amit M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roniger&gt;{{cite journal  |doi=10.2307/4150135 |jstor=4150135 |title=Political Clientelism, Democracy, and Market Economy |journal=Comparative Politics |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=353–375 |last1=Roniger |first1=Luis |last2=Briquet |first2=Jean-Louis |last3=Sawicki |first3=Frederic |last4=Auyero |first4=Javier |last5=Piattoni |first5=Simona |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Graham, Richard (1997) Clientelismo na cultura política brasileira.

==Origins==
The origin of the practice has been traced to ancient Rome.  Here relationships between the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron ''(patronus)'' and client ''(cliens)'']] were seen as crucial to understanding the political process. While the obligations between these were mutual, the key point is they were hierarchical. These relationships might be best viewed not as an entity but rather as a network ''(clientela)'', with the ''patronus'' himself perhaps being obligated to someone of greater power, and the ''cliens'' perhaps having more than one patron. These extensions increase the possibilities of conflicting interests arising. While the ''familia'' was the basic unit underlying Roman society, the interlocking networks ''(clientela)'' acted as restrictions on their autonomy but allowed a more complex society to develop. Historians of the late medieval period evolved the concept into [[bastard feudalism]].  There is, as is usual, ambiguity in the use of political terminology and the terms "clientelism", the "patron-client relationship", "[[patronage]]" and the [[political machine]] are sometimes used to describe similar or related concepts.&lt;ref name="Roniger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tornquist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, Christopher (1985) ''Third World Politics'', Croom Helm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich S. Gruen|Gruen, Erich S.]] (1986) "''Patrocinium'' and ''clientela''," in ''The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome'', University of California Press, Vol. 1, pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reigns of [[Julius Caesar]] (49-44 BCE) and [[Tiberius]] (14-16 AD) have been characterized as examples of widespread clientelism. In the 1500s, French political theorist [[Étienne de La Boétie]] did not use the term ''clientelism'', but described the practice of emperors who used gifts to the public to gain loyalty from those who were eager to accept what amounted to [[bribery]]:
:Tyrants would distribute largesse, a bushel of wheat, a gallon of wine, and a [[Sestertius|sesterce]] [coin] : and then everybody would shamelessly cry, "Long live the King!" The fools did not realize that they were merely recovering a portion of their own property, and that their ruler could not have given them what they were receiving without having first taken it from them. A man might one day be presented with a sesterce and gorge himself at the public feast, lauding [[Tiberius]] and [[Nero]] for handsome liberality, who on the morrow, would be forced to abandon his property to their avarice, his children to their lust, his very blood to the cruelty of these magnificent emperors, without offering any more resistance than a stone or a tree stump. The mob has always behaved in this way--eagerly open to bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne de La Boétie (1552-1553). The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude (Harry Kurz, transl.), New York: Free Life, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
Stokes et al. distinguish clientelism as a form of non-programmatic policy within distributive politics. It meets the criteria through failing to meet the two requirements of programmatic distribution, that are (1) 'formalized and public' and (2) 'shape actual distribution of benefits or resources'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within non-programmatic policy, clientelism is then distinguished from 'pork-barrel politics' in that voters are given a benefit or are able to avoid a cost conditional on their returning the favor with a vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The patron/client system can be defined as a mutual arrangement between a person that has authority, social status, wealth, or some other personal resource (patron) and another who benefits from their support or influence (client).&lt;ref&gt;webref.org&lt;/ref&gt; The patron provides selective access to goods and opportunities, and place themselves or their support in positions from which they can divert resources and services in their favor.  Their partners-clients- are expected to buy support, and in some cases, votes. Patrons target low-income families to exchange their needed resources for their abundant resources: time, a vote, and insertion into networks of other potential supporters whom they can influence.&lt;ref&gt;Roniger, Luis. Political Clientelism, Democracy, and Market Economy. 3rd ed. Vol. 36. New York: : PhD. Program in Political Science of the City U of New York, 2004. 353-375. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, patrons are unable to access the information needed to effectively form the exchange; thus they hire intermediaries, brokers, that more equipped to find out what the targeted voter needs, which voters will require less prodding, and if the voter followed through on their end of the bargain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As Stokes, Dunning, Nazareno, and Brusco emphasize, brokers in turn serve political leaders, and they may also not target resources exactly as leaders would wish; the resulting [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent]] problems can have important implications for understanding how clientelism works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Patronage, turnout buying, abstention buying, and vote buying are subcategories of clientelism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patronage refers to an intra-party flow of benefits to members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Turnout buying, coined by Nichter, treats or bribes voters to the polls whereas abstention buying treats or bribes voters to keep them from going to the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12058|title = Varieties of Clientelism: Machine Politics during Elections|journal = American Journal of Political Science|volume = 58|issue = 2|pages = 415–432|year = 2014|last1 = Gans-Morse|first1 = Jordan|last2 = Mazzuca|first2 = Sebastián|last3 = Nichter|first3 = Simeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vote buying is a direct transfer of goods or services, in exchange for one's support and vote.  The result for the good or service is a question of did you or will you vote for me?&lt;ref&gt;Goodin, Robert E. The Oxford Handbook of Political Science. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:ClientelismVsDemoracy.jpg|thumb|Shows basic differences in mechanics between governments taking part in clientelism and those adhering to more strict democratic ideals]] --&gt;
A key to understanding clientelism might come in stressing not only the mutually beneficial relationships of exchange but also asymmetries in power or standing. Implied is a certain selectivity in access to key resources and markets. Those with access, the ''patrons'' (and/or sometimes ''sub-patrons'' or ''brokers'') rely on the subordination and dependence of the clients. In return for receiving some benefits the clients should provide political support.

==Examples==
Stokes' research on clientelism in Argentina assumed that the [[Justicialist Party|Peronist party]] was providing financial support to prospective voters to buy their votes. It was hypothesized that Peronists targeted moderately opposed voters because they were thought to be easily persuaded to change sides at the party's minimal expense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=Susan C.|date=August 2005|title=Perverse Accountability: A Formal Model of Machine Politics with Evidence from Argentina|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=3|pages=315–325|doi=10.1017/S0003055405051683|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes elaborated on the need of the Argentinian Peronist party to be able to track who their clientele in fact voted for amidst the secret ballot system. Stokes' argument is that the potential for vote buying depends on the accuracy with which the patron party, the Peronists in the case of Argentina, are able to monitor votes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She uses evidence to show that overall smaller communities offer less anonymity, making it easier for the patrons to find out who committed to supporting them. Thus, Stokes concludes that this is one of the reasons why vote buying is more frequent in relatively small communities. Another reason is that smaller communities are generally more poor. Furthermore, smaller communities, which are generally more poor and have a greater need for resources, are a more attractive target.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Research by Nichter promoted a simpler hypothesis for the Argentinian election cycle: to prove Peronists were solely buying supporting voters' turnout, not all the people's votes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichter|first=Simeon|date=February 2008|title=Vote Buying or Turnout Buying? Machine Politics and the Secret Ballot|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=102|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1017/S0003055408080106|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed Stokes' arguments on patrons spying on smaller and poorer communities, instead saying the Peronists initially targeted votes assumed to be their strong supporters. In this case the patrons would be reasonably sure they receive a vote from a person if this person receives a good from them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Causes==
Numerous factors which lead to a clientelist political system have been identified. One large one is poverty. As the wealth of the average citizen increases, patrons must spend greater and greater sums of money to gain their votes. Therefore, clientelist strategies are most effective in societies with a prevalence of poverty, when the cost of giving constituents gifts is low.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickens|first=Allen|date=June 2011|title=Clientelism|journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=14 |pages=289–310|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.031908.220508}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is more, the electoral system also heavily affects the viability of clientelism. Candidate-focused elections allow patrons to enforce direct trades of support for favors flowing from office. This helps foster personal relationships necessary in clientelism. In more politicized bureaucracies, elected officials have greater control over government services, meaning that patrons are better able to redirect public resources to their constituencies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stokes|first=Susan|date=July 2009|title=Political Clientelism|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Politics|volume=1|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199566020.001.0001|isbn=9780199566020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, clientelism is much more likely to occur in high poverty states where elections are personalized and elected officials have large control over public resources.

==Consequences==
Clientelism has generally negative consequences on democracy and government while also having more uncertain consequences on the economy.

The accountability relationship in a democracy, where voters hold elected officials accountable for their actions, is undermined by clientelism. This is because under clientelism, votes are contingent on gifts to clients rather than the performance of elected officials in office. Clientelism also degrades democratic institutions such as the secret ballot and administrative oversight. These factors both weaken democratic institutions and negatively impact the efficiency of government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Corruption and the perception of corruption have also been established as strongly correlated with clientelist systems. There are many reasons for this. For one, patrons often appear above the law in many clientelist systems. What is more, some acts in clientelist systems such as vote buying, could be inherently illegal. Finally, resources needed for patrons to maintain the clientelist system could necessitate illicit means of obtaining goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Singer|first=Matthew|date=January 2009|title=Buying Voters with Dirty Money: The Relationship between Clientelism and Corruption|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228128652|conference=Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that because patrons focus on the control and procurement of private goods, they also neglect public goods such as roads and public schools which aid economic development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars also note that rent seeking and corruption, prevalent in clientelist systems, could negatively impact the economy as well. Nevertheless, there is still great uncertainty in the economic effects of clientelism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Controversy==
It is common to link clientelism with corruption; both involve political actors using public and private resources for personal gain, but they are not synonymous. Corruption is commonly defined as "dishonest and fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery",&lt;ref&gt;"Corruption" Def. 1. Oxford Dictionary Online, n.d., Mon. 1 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; while political clientelism is seen as "the distribution of benefits targeted to individuals or groups in exchange for electoral support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |last=Larreguy |first=Horacio A. |title=Monitoring Political Brokers: Evidence from Clientelistic Networks in Mexico |url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/8456/ |date=January 2013 |ssrn=2225027}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to associate the two together because they moderately overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11432593/ {{lang|it|Scambio illecito se il metodo è mafioso}}], Diritto e giustizia,13 maggio 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different forms of corruptions that have nothing to do with clientelism, such as voter intimidation or ballot stuffing. "Clientelism is considered negative because its intention is to generate 'private' revenue for patrons and clients and, as a result obstruct 'public' revenue for members of the general community who are not a part of the patron-client arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;Kawata, Junʼichi. Comparing Political Corruption and Clientelism. Aldershot, Hampshire, England: Ashgate, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clientelism as a strategy of political organisation is substantially different from other strategies which rely on appeals to wider programmatic objectives or simply emphasize higher degrees of competence. It is often assumed that clientelism is a vestige of political underdevelopment, a form of corruption, and that political modernization will reduce or end it. But alternative views stressing the persistence of clientelism – and the patronage associated with it – have been recognized.&lt;ref name="Roniger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tornquist" /&gt;

The '''Comandos Autónomos Anticapitalistas''' ('''CAA''' or '''CCAA''') ({{lang-eu|Komando Autonomo Antikapitalistak}}; "Autonomous Anticapitalist Commandos") were a [[Basque people|Basque]] armed group in Spain with [[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]] politics, defined as an [[anarchism|anarchistic]] breakaway of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

The group was very active in the 1970s and 1980s. The most important attack was the assassination of [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] [[Senate of Spain|Senator]] [[Enrique Casas]] in 1984, which was rejected by all the political spectrum including ETA, which at the time, rejected violence against politicians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Soon after, one of the few operating CAA commandos was ambushed by the [[Guardia Civil]] at the bay of [[Pasaia]], killing four – all but one.

The ambush at Pasaia is dealt with in a documentary film called "Pasaiako Badia". [[Pasaiako Badia]] In this film, witnesses, relatives and others recount the arrest of Rosa Jimeno by the Spanish police, her torture and the trap set for the CAA, which included Rosa being tied up and a rendezvous with the members of CAA arranged. She was forced to set a date with CAA members near the harbor at Pasaia in March 1984.  Once the CAA members arrived in the harbor the armed police, shot Pelu and Pelitxo, killing both, and arrested two, ‘Txapas' and ‘Kurro', who were tortured and killed. Joseba Merino&lt;ref name="undefined" /&gt; and Rosa survived. The G.A.L. a paramilitary group including former francoist officers which used public funds and participated in the Spanish state's war on terrorism was allegedly involved in the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}
'''Communitarianism''' is a [[philosophy]] that emphasizes the connection between the [[individual]] and the [[community]]. Its overriding philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a [[family]], communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history.&lt;ref&gt;Avineri, S.and de-Shalit, Avner. (1992) ''Communitarianism and Individualism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Communitarianism usually opposes extreme [[individualism]] and disagrees with extreme [[laissez-faire]] policies that neglect the stability of the overall community.

==Terminology==
The philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term "communitarian" was coined in 1841, by [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], a leader of the British [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, who used it in referring  to [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]], and other idealists, who experimented with communal styles of life. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term "communitarianism" gained currency through association with the work of a small group of political philosophers. Their application of the label "communitarian" was controversial, even among communitarians, because, in the West, the term "communitarian" evokes associations with the ideologies of [[socialism]] and [[collectivism]]; so, public leaders—and some of the academics who champion this school of thought—usually avoid the term "communitarian", while still advocating and advancing the ideas of communitarianism.

The term is primarily used in two senses:
* '''Philosophical communitarianism''' considers [[classical liberalism]] to be [[ontology|ontologically]] and [[epistemology|epistemologically]] incoherent, and opposes it on those grounds. Unlike classical liberalism, which construes communities as originating from the voluntary acts of pre-community [[individual]]s, it emphasizes the role of the community in defining and shaping individuals. Communitarians believe that the value of community is not sufficiently recognized in liberal theories of justice.
* '''Ideological communitarianism''' is characterized as a [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] [[ideology]] that is sometimes marked by leftism on economic issues and centrism on social issues. This usage was coined recently. When the term is capitalized, it usually refers to the Responsive Communitarian movement of [[Amitai Etzioni]] and other philosophers.

==Origins==
While the term communitarian was coined only in the mid-nineteenth century, ideas that are communitarian in nature appear much earlier. They are found in some classical socialist doctrine (e.g. writings about the early commune and about workers' solidarity), and further back in the [[New Testament]]. Communitarianism has been traced back to early [[monasticism]], but in the twentieth century began to be formulated as a philosophy by [[Dorothy Day]] and the [[Catholic Worker movement]]. In an early article the ''Catholic Worker'' clarified the dogma of the Mystical Body of Christ as the basis for the movement's communitarianism. Communitarianism is also related to the [[personalist]] philosophy of [[Emmanuel Mounier]].

A number of early sociologists had strongly communitarian elements in their work, such as [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in his comparison of [[Gemeinschaft]] (oppressive but nurturing communities) and Gesellschaft (liberating but impersonal societies), and Emile Durkheim's concerns about the integrating role of social values and the relations between the individual and society. Both authors warned of the dangers of [[anomie]] (normlessness) and alienation in modern societies composed of atomized individuals who had gained their liberty but lost their social moorings.  Modern sociologists saw the rise of a mass society and the decline of communal bonds and respect for traditional values and authority in the United  States as of the 1960s. Among those who raised these issues were Robert Nisbet (Twilight of Authority),&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert, Twilight of Authority. Indianapolis: LibertyFund, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert N. Bellah]] (Habits of the Heart),&lt;ref&gt;Bellah, Robert N., Habits of the Heart, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Ehrenhalt (The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenhalt Ehrenhalt, Alan, The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America. New York:BasicBooks, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Bowling Alone (2000), Robert Putnam documented the decline of "social capital" and stressed the importance of "bridging social capital," in which bonds of connectedness are formed across diverse social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Putman, Robert D., Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of AmericanCommunity. New York:Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to criticism that the term 'community' is too vague or cannot be defined, [[Amitai Etzioni]], one of the leaders of the American communitarian movement, pointed out that communities can be defined with reasonable precision as having two characteristics: first, a web of affect-laden relationships among a group of individuals, relationships that often crisscross and reinforce one another (as opposed to one-on-one or chain-like individual relationships); and second, a measure of commitment to a set of shared values, norms, and meanings, and a shared history and identity – in short, a particular culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckert, Jen. "Communitarianism." International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology. London:Routledge, 2006. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, author David E. Pearson argued that "[t]o earn the appellation 'community,' it seems to me, groups must be able to exert moral suasion and extract a measure of compliance from their members. That is, communities are necessarily, indeed, by definition, coercive as well as moral, threatening their members with the stick of sanctions if they stray, offering them the carrot of certainty and stability if they don't."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

What is specifically meant by "community" in the context of communitarianism can vary greatly between authors and time periods. Historically, communities have been small and localized. However, as the reach of economic and technological forces extended, more-expansive communities became necessary in order to provide effective normative and political guidance to these forces, prompting the rise of national communities in Europe in the 17th century. Since the late 20th century there has been some growing recognition that the scope of even these communities is too limited, as many challenges that people now face, such as the threat of nuclear war and that of global environmental degradation and economic crises, cannot be handled on a national basis. This has led to the quest for more-encompassing communities, such as the [[European Union]]. Whether truly supra-national communities can be developed is far from clear.

More modern communities can take many different forms, but are often limited in scope and reach. For example, members of one residential community are often also members of other communities – such as work, ethnic, or religious ones. As a result, modern community members have multiple sources of attachments, and if one threatens to become overwhelming, individuals will often pull back and turn to another community for their attachments.

Thus, communitarianism is the reaction of some intellectuals to the problems of Western society, an attempt to find flexible forms of balance between the individual and society, the autonomy of the individual and the interests of the community, between the common good and freedom, rights and duties.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Communitarian philosophy==&lt;!--'Communitarian philosophy' redirects here --&gt;
{{Christian Democracy sidebar|Christian democracy|expanded=all}}
In moral and political philosophy, communitarians are best known for their critiques of [[John Rawls]]' political liberalism, detailed at length in his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Communitarians criticize the image Rawls presents of humans as atomistic individuals, and stress that individuals who are well-integrated into communities are better able to reason and act in responsible ways than isolated individuals, but add that if social pressure to conform rises to high levels, it will undermine the individual self. Communitarians uphold the importance of the social realm, and communities in particular, though they differ in the extent to which their conceptions are attentive to liberty and individual rights. Even with these general similarities, communitarians, like members of many other schools of thought, differ considerably from one another. There are several distinct (and at times wildly divergent) schools of communitarian thought.

The following authors have communitarian tendencies in the philosophical sense, but have all taken pains to distance themselves from the political ideology known as communitarianism, which is discussed further below:
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]{{spaced ndash}}''After Virtue''
* [[Michael Sandel]]{{spaced ndash}}''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice''
* [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]{{spaced ndash}}''Sources of the Self''
* [[Michael Walzer]]{{spaced ndash}}''Spheres of Justice''

==Academic communitarianism==&lt;!-- 'Academic communitarianism' redirects here --&gt;
Whereas the classical liberalism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] can be viewed as a reaction to centuries of authoritarianism, oppressive government, overbearing communities, and rigid dogma, modern communitarianism can be considered a reaction to excessive individualism, understood as an undue emphasis on individual rights, leading people to become selfish or egocentric.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/communitarianism#ref299521|title=Communitarianism {{!}} political and social philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close relation between the individual and the community was discussed on a theoretical level by [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], among other academic communitarians, in their criticisms of philosophical liberalism, especially the work of the American liberal theorist [[John Rawls]] and that of the German Enlightenment philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. They argued that contemporary liberalism failed to account for the complex set of social relations that all individuals in the modern world are a part of. Liberalism is rooted in an untenable ontology that posits the existence of generic individuals and fails to account for social embeddeddness. To the contrary, they argued, there are no generic individuals but rather only Germans or Russians, Berliners or Muscovites, or members of some other particularistic community. Because individual identity is partly constructed by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. Thus, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles decided behind Rawls' [[veil of ignorance]], because individuals cannot exist in such an abstracted state, even in principle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Academic communitarians also contend that the nature of the political community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively dangerous. Good societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures—they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.

In addition to Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, other thinkers sometimes associated with academic communitarianism include [[Michael Walzer]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Seyla Benhabib]], and [[Shlomo Avineri]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Social capital===

Beginning in the late 20th century, many authors began to observe a deterioration in the social networks of the United States. In the book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', [[Robert Putnam]] observed that nearly every form of civic organization has undergone drops in membership exemplified by the fact that, while more people are bowling than in the 1950s, there are fewer bowling leagues.

This results in a decline in "[[social capital]]", described by Putnam as "the collective value of all '[[social networks]]' and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other". According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy.

Communitarians seek to bolster social capital and the institutions of [[civil society]]. The Responsive Communitarian Platform described it thus:&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;The Communitarian Network, ''[http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html Responsive Communitarian Platform Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114032208/http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html |date=2010-01-14 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Many social goals ... require partnership between public and private groups. Though government should not seek to replace local communities, it may need to empower them by strategies of support, including revenue-sharing and technical assistance. There is a great need for study and experimentation with creative use of the structures of civil society, and public-private cooperation, especially where the delivery of health, educational and social services are concerned."

===Positive rights===

Important to some supporters of communitarian philosophy is the concept of [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], which are rights or guarantees to certain things. These may include state-subsidized education, state-subsidized housing, a safe and clean environment, universal health care, and even the right to a job with the concomitant obligation of the government or individuals to provide one. To this end, communitarians generally support social security programs, public works programs, and laws limiting such things as pollution.

A common objection is that by providing such rights, communitarians violate the [[negative and positive rights|negative rights]] of the citizens; rights to ''not'' have something done for you. For example, taxation to pay for such programs as described above dispossesses individuals of property. Proponents of positive rights, by attributing the protection of negative rights to the society rather than the government, respond that individuals would not have any rights in the absence of societies—a central tenet of communitarianism—and thus have a social responsibility to give something back to it. Some have viewed this as a negation of [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. However, what is or is not a "natural right" is a source of contention in modern politics, as well as historically; for example, whether or not universal health care, private property or protection from polluters can be considered a birthright.

Alternatively, some agree that negative rights may be violated by a government action, but argue that it is justifiable if the positive rights protected outweigh the negative rights lost. In the same vein, supporters of positive rights further argue that negative rights are irrelevant in their absence. Moreover, some communitarians "experience this less as a case of being used for others' ends and more as a way of contributing to the purposes of a community I regard as my own".&lt;ref&gt;Sandel, ''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice'', 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other communitarians question the very idea of natural rights and their place in a properly functioning community. They claim that instead, claims of rights and entitlements creates a society unable to form cultural institutions and grounded social norms based on shared values. Rather, the liberalist claim to individual rights leads to a morality centered on individual emotivism, as ethical issues can no longer be solved by working through common understandings of the good. The worry here is that not only is society individualized, but so are moral claims.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, Alasdair C. After Virtue. Notre Dame, IN: U of Notre Dame, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsive communitarianism movement==
In the early 1990s, in response to the perceived breakdown in the moral fabric of society engendered by excessive individualism, Amitai Etzioni and William A. Galston began to organize working meetings to think through communitarian approaches to key societal issues. This ultimately took the communitarian philosophy from a small academic group, introduced it into public life, and recast its philosophical content.

Deeming themselves "responsive communitarians" in order to distinguish the movement from  authoritarian communitarians, Etzioni and Galston, along with a varied group of academics (including Mary Ann Glendon, Thomas A. Spragens, James Fishkin, Benjamin Barber, Hans Joas, Philip Selznick, and [[Robert N. Bellah]], among others) drafted and published The Responsive Communitarian Platform&lt;ref&gt;]{{cite web |url=http://communitariannetwork.org/about-communitarianism/responsive-communitarian-platform/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709214807/http://communitariannetwork.org/about-communitarianism/responsive-communitarian-platform/ |archivedate=2013-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their shared political principles, and the ideas in it were eventually elaborated in academic and popular books and periodicals, gaining thereby a measure of political currency in the West. Etzioni later formed the Communitarian Network to study and promote communitarian approaches to social issues and began publishing a quarterly journal, ''The Responsive Community''.

The main thesis of responsive communitarianism is that people face two major sources of normativity: that of the common good and that of autonomy and rights, neither of which in principle should take precedence over the other. This can be contrasted with other political and social philosophies which derive their core assumptions from one overarching principle (such as liberty/autonomy for libertarianism). It further posits that a good society is based on a carefully crafted balance between liberty and social order, between individual rights and personal responsibility, and between pluralistic and socially established values.

Responsive communitarianism stresses the importance of society and its institutions above and beyond that of the state and the market, which are often the focus of other political philosophies. It also emphasizes the key role played by socialization, moral culture, and informal social controls rather than state coercion or market pressures. It provides an alternative to liberal individualism and a major counterpoint to authoritarian communitarianism by stressing that strong rights presume strong responsibilities and that one should not be neglected in the name of the other.

Following standing sociological positions, communitarians assume that the moral character of individuals tends to degrade over time unless that character is continually and communally reinforced. They contend that a major function of the community, as a building block of moral infrastructure, is to reinforce the character of its members through the community's "moral voice," defined as the informal sanction of others, built into a web of informal affect-laden relationships, which communities provide.

===Influence===
Responsive communitarians have been playing a considerable public role, presenting themselves as the founders of a different kind of environmental movement, one dedicated to shoring up society (as opposed to the state) rather than nature. Like environmentalism, communitarianism appeals to audiences across the political spectrum, although it has found greater acceptance with some groups than others.

Although communitarianism is a small philosophical school, it has had considerable influence on public dialogues and politics. There are strong similarities between communitarian thinking and the Third Way, the political thinking of centrist Democrats in the United States, and the Neue Mitte in Germany. Communitarianism played a key role in Tony Blair's remaking of the British socialist Labour Party into "New Labour" and a smaller role in President Bill Clinton's campaigns. Other politicians have echoed key communitarian themes, such as Hillary Clinton, who has long held that to raise a child takes not just parents, family, friends and neighbors, but a whole village.&lt;ref&gt;Dionne, E.J., Our Divided Political Heart: The Battle for the American Idea in an Age of Discontent, New York: Bloomsbury USA, 2012, 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; It has also been suggested that the "&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[compassionate conservatism]]" espoused by President Bush during his 2000 presidential campaign was a form of conservative communitarian thinking, though he too did not implement it in his policy program. Cited policies have included economic and rhetorical support for education, volunteerism, and community programs, as well as a social emphasis on promoting families, character education, traditional values, and faith-based projects.

President Barack Obama gave voice to communitarian ideas and ideals in his book ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Obama, Barack. ''The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream''. New York: Crown Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 2008 presidential election campaign he repeatedly called upon Americans to "ground our politics in the notion of a common good," for an "age of responsibility," and for foregoing identity politics in favor of community-wide unity building. However, for many in the West, the term communitarian conjures up authoritarian and collectivist associations, so many public leaders – and even several academics considered champions of this school – avoid the term while embracing and advancing its ideas.

Reflecting the dominance of [[Left-Right politics|liberal and conservative politics]] in the United States, no major party and few elected officials openly advocate communitarianism. Thus there is no consensus on individual policies, but some that most communitarians endorse have been enacted. Nonetheless, there is a small faction of communitarians within the Democratic Party; prominent communitarians include [[Bob Casey Jr.]], [[Joe Donnelly]], and [[Claire McCaskill]]. Many communitarian Democrats are part of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]]. A small communitarian faction within the Republican Party also exists. [[Rick Santorum]] is an example of a communitarian Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstate.com/diary/tex_whitley/2012/01/05/rick-santorum-and-communitarian-conservatism/|title=Rick Santorum and Communitarian Conservatism|first=Brad|last=Jackson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite possible that the United States'  [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] ideological underpinnings have suppressed major communitarian factions from emerging.&lt;ref&gt;The Responsive Community, Vol. 3, Issue 1. Winter 1992/93. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dana Milbank]], writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', remarked of modern communitarians, "There is still no such thing as a card-carrying communitarian, and therefore no consensus on policies. Some, such as [[John DiIulio]] and outside Bush adviser [[Marvin Olasky]], favor religious solutions for communities, while others, like Etzioni and Galston, prefer secular approaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janda.org/b20/News%20articles/GW%2C%20the%20Communitarian.htm|title=Needed: Catchword For Bush Ideology; 'Communitarianism' Finds Favor|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the right-libertarian ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone. The Reason-Rupe poll found that "Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups". Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/29/reason-rupe-poll-finds-24-of-a|title=Reason-Rupe Poll Finds 24 Percent of Americans are Economically Conservative and Socially Liberal, 28 Percent Liberal, 28 Percent Conservative, and 20 Percent Communitarian|first=Emily|last=Ekins|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=''[[Reason Magazine]]''|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar Gallup survey in 2011 included possible [[centrism|centrist/moderate]] responses. That poll reported that 17% expressed conservative views, 22% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, 17% expressed centrist views, and 24% expressed liberal views. The organization used the terminology "the bigger the better" to describe communitarianism.&lt;ref name="poll" /&gt;

The [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] party, founded and led by [[Imran Khan]], is considered the first political party in the world which has declared communitarianism as one of their official ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electioncell2013.com/pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-pti/7667 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104746/http://www.electioncell2013.com/pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-pti/7667 |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other political philosophies==
[[Image:Political-spectrum-multiaxis.png|thumb|250px|A variant of the [[Nolan chart]] using traditional political color coding ([[Red (political adjective)|red leftism]] versus [[Blue#Politics|blue rightism]]) with communitarianism on the top left.]]
Early communitarians were charged with being, in effect, social conservatives. However, many contemporary communitarians, especially those who define themselves as responsive communitarians, fully realize and often stress that they do not seek to return to traditional communities, with their authoritarian power structure, rigid stratification, and discriminatory practices against minorities and women. Responsive communitarians seek to build communities based on open participation, dialogue, and truly shared values. Linda McClain, a critic of communitarians, recognizes this feature of the responsive communitarians, writing that some communitarians do "recognize the need for careful evaluation of what is good and bad about [any specific] tradition and the possibility of severing certain features . . . from others."&lt;ref&gt;McClain, Linda, C, "Rights and irresponsibility," Duke Law Journal (March 1994): 989–1088.&lt;/ref&gt; And R. Bruce Douglass writes, "Unlike conservatives, communitarians are aware that the days when the issues we face as a society could be settled on the basis of the beliefs of a privileged segment of the population have long since passed."&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, R. Bruce. "The renewal of democracy and the communitarian prospect." The Responsive Community 4.3 (1994): 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major way the communitarian position differs from the social conservative one is that although communitarianism's ideal "good society" "reaches into the private realm, it seeks to cultivate only a limited set of core virtues through an organically developed set of values rather than having an expansive or holistically normative agenda given by the state. For example, American society favors being religious over being atheist, but is rather neutral with regard to which particular religion a person should follow. There are no state-prescribed dress codes, "correct" number of children to have, or places one is expected to live, etc. In short, a key defining characteristic of the ideal communitarian society is that in contrast to a liberal state, it creates shared formulations of the good, but the scope of this good is much smaller than that advanced by authoritarian societies."&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai, What is Political? (2003). CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2157170&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian governments often embrace extremist ideologies and rule with brute force, accompanied with severe restrictions on personal freedom, political and civil rights. Authoritarian governments are overt about the role of the government as director and commander. [[Civil society]] and democracy are not generally characteristic of authoritarian regimes.

==Criticisms==
Liberal theorists such as Simon Caney&lt;ref&gt;'Liberalism and communitarianism: a misconceived debate'. Political Studies 40, 273–290&lt;/ref&gt; disagree that philosophical communitarianism has any interesting criticisms to make of liberalism. They reject the communitarian charges that liberalism neglects the value of community, and holds an "atomized" or asocial view of the self.

According to [[Peter Sutch]] the principal criticisms of communitarianism are:
# that communitarianism leads necessarily to moral relativism,
# that this relativism leads necessarily to a re-endorsement of the status quo in international politics, and
# that such a position relies upon a discredited ontological argument that posits the foundational status of the community or state.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sutch, Ethics, Justice, and International Relations, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he goes on to show that such arguments cannot be leveled against the particular communitarian theories of [[Michael Walzer]] and [[Mervyn Frost]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Other critics emphasize close relation of communitarianism to [[neoliberalism]] and new policies of dismantling the [[welfare state]] institutions through development of the third sector.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski, ''Neoliberalizm i spoleczenstwo obywatelskie (Neoliberalism and Civil Society)'', Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Mikołaja Kopernika, Torun 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Countercurrent''' ({{lang-it|Controcorrente}}) is a small, Italian, [[trotskyism|trotskyist]] political party. It used to be a faction within the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

The group emerged in 2006 as a split from [[Communist Project]], when their leader [[Marco Ferrando]] decided to leave the party in order to form his own [[Workers' Communist Party (Italy)|Workers' Communist Party]]. For the 24–27 July 2008 congress the faction formed a common list with [[The Ernesto]], another minority faction, and obtained 7.7% of the delegates. In that occasion they supported the election of [[Paolo Ferrero]], leader of the [[Refoundation in Movement]]-[[Being Communists]] motion, as party secretary, thus joining for the first time the majority of the party.

In 2010 the faction embraced the [[Committee for a Workers' International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/4285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the party was the most important promoter of the massive Genoa Public Transportation Strike, that went on for a week and was considered the biggest non-general strike of the year.

In 2017, Controcorrente left the CWI over disagreements regarding, among other issues, the role of the European Union and [[Brexit]]. A large minority including mostly younger members split from Controcorrente to remain part of the CWI, forming a new organisation named [[Resistenze Internazionali]].&lt;ref&gt;https://resistenzeinternazionali.it/2017/08/un-inizio-cwi-cil-italia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLP first fielded candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], winning one seat in the Senate and the non-voting seat in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia]] and the [[National Party of Australia]] (previously the Country Party and National Country Party).

At the [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 election]] it increased its numbers, winning 11 seats.

==History==
===Origins===
The Territory Country Party members first contested the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]], with a newly established federal [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] contesting the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 federal election]]. The 1922 election saw the main opposition party to the Australian Labor Party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] deprived of a majority, and were required to form a coalition in order to command a majority on the floor of parliament. The price for such support was the resignation of Nationalist (ex-Labor) Prime Minister, [[Billy Hughes]], who was replaced by [[Stanley Bruce]].

In 1922, the federal [[Division of Northern Territory]] was created, with one non-voting Member in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=DocumentingDemocracy&gt;Documenting Democracy: [http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331140907/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |date=31 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold George Nelson]] was the inaugural member serving between 16 December 1922 and 15 September 1934. He was elected as an Independent but later joined the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). Between 15 September 1934 and 10 December 1949 the [[Division of Northern Territory]] was held by [[Adair Blain]], an independent member. Between 10 December 1949 and 31 October 1966 the Division was held by [[Jock Nelson]], a member of the ALP. The Territory seat was won by the Country Party's [[Sam Calder]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1966|1966 federal election]], who held the seat from 26 November 1966 to 19 September 1980.

In 1966, the Country Party was established in the Northern Territory, while the Liberal Party was a small party. In recognition of this, the local Liberals supported the Country Party's Calder for the sole NT seat from 1969 to 1972. An alliance had formed, primarily against the conservatives' main opponent, the ALP.  After the gradual extension of limited voting rights, in 1968 the federal Coalition government gave the Member for Northern Territory full voting rights.&lt;ref name=DocumentingDemocracy /&gt;

===Foundation and electoral record===
After the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]] and the subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]], legislation was passed to give the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the Northern Territory representation in the [[Australian Senate]], with two senators being elected.

The [[Whitlam Government]] passed legislation in 1974 to establish a fully elected [[unicameral]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] to replace the previous partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]], which had been in existence since 1947. The term of the Legislative Assembly was four years. Initially, the Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 members, which was increased in 1982 to 25 members, the present number. The Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978.

Following the creation of the Legislative Assembly in 1974, the Territory's branches of the Country and Liberal parties merged to form the "Country Liberal Party" (CLP) to field candidates at the [[Northern Territory general election, 1974|1974 general election]] for the Legislative Assembly,&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/&gt; going on to win 17 out of 19 seats.&lt;ref name="Lansford2014"/&gt; Calder was largely responsible for the push to unite the non-Labor forces in the Territory.

The CLP fielded candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], winning one seat each in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal National (previously the Country Party and National Country Party) and Liberal parties.&lt;ref name="Lansford2014"/&gt; The CLP contests seats for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the Northern Territory rather than the Liberal or National parties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The CLP has full voting rights within the National Party, and observer status with the Liberal Party.

The CLP governed the Northern Territory from 1974 until the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 election]]. During this time, it never faced more than nine opposition members. Indeed, the CLP's dominance was so absolute that its internal politics were seen as a bigger threat than any opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Green|Green, Antony]]. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm 2005 election summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906125850/http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm |date=6 September 2013 }}. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 2005-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially pronounced in the mid-1980s, when a series of party-room coups resulted in the Territory having three Chief Ministers in four years.

===2001–2011: In opposition===
At the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 election]] the Australian Labor Party won government by one seat, ending 27 years of CLP government.&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/&gt; The loss marked a major turning point in Northern Territory politics, a result which was exacerbated when, at the [[Northern Territory general election, 2005|2005 election]], the ALP won the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, reducing the once-dominant party to just four members in the Legislative Assembly. This result was only outdone by the 1974 election, in which the CLP faced only two independents as opposition.  The CLP even lost two seats in [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], an area where the ALP had never come close to winning any seats before.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], the CLP won the newly formed seat of [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]], based on Darwin/Palmerston, in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Carlisle2005"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rodney P. Carlisle|title=Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpx2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA535|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6531-5|page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the CLP held one seat in the House of Representatives, and one seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name="Lansford2014"/&gt; The CLP lost its federal lower house in the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]],&lt;ref name="Lansford2014"/&gt; but regained it when Palmerston deputy mayor [[Natasha Griggs]] won back Solomon for the CLP.  She sat with the Liberals in the House.

The [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 election]] saw the CLP recover from the severe loss it suffered three years earlier, increasing its representation from four to 11 members. Following the 2011 decision of ALP-turned-independent member [[Alison Anderson]] to join the CLP, this increased to CLP's representation to 12 in the Assembly, leaving the incumbent Henderson Government to govern in minority with the support of Independent MP [[Gerry Wood]].

Historically, the CLP has been particularly dominant in the Territory's two major cities, [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]/Palmerston and [[Alice Springs]]. However, in recent years the ALP has pulled even with the CLP in the Darwin area; indeed, its 2001 victory was fueled by an unexpected swing in Darwin.

===2012 return to office===
{{main|Northern Territory general election, 2012}}
The CLP under the leadership of [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] returned to power in the [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|2012 election]] with 16 of 25 seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Antony|title=Final Figures for 2012 Northern Territory Election|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110823032733/http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeating the incumbent Labor Government led by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]]. In the lead up to the Territory election, CLP Senator [[Nigel Scullion]] sharply criticised the [[Gillard Government|Federal Labor Government]] for its suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia - an economic mainstay of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kristy O'Brien |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-12/politicians-link-suicides-to-cattle-export-ban/4256526 |title=Politicians link suicides to cattle export ban |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2016-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031013826/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-12/politicians-link-suicides-to-cattle-export-ban/4256526 |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election victory ended 11 years of ALP rule in the Northern Territory. The victory was also notable for the support it achieved from [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] in pastoral and remote electorates. Large swings were achieved in remote Territory electorates (where the indigenous population comprised around two-thirds of voters) and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922011057/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the indigenous candidates elected were high-profile Aboriginal activist [[Bess Price]] and former ALP member [[Alison Anderson]]. Anderson was appointed Minister for Indigenous Advancement. In a nationally reported speech in November 2012, Anderson condemned welfare dependency and a culture of entitlement in her first ministerial statement on the status of Aboriginal communities in the Territory and said the CLP would focus on improving education and on helping create real jobs for indigenous people.&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/my-people-must-grow-up-alison-anderson/story-fn9hm1pm-1226508746330|title=Subscribe to The Australian - Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone &amp; Android apps|author=|date=|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202020706/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/my-people-must-grow-up-alison-anderson/story-fn9hm1pm-1226508746330|archivedate=2 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the CLP introduced mandatory alcohol rehabilitation for recidivist problem drinkers to replace a banned drinker register, Giles dismissed critics of the policy as "lefty welfare-orientated people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24465989|title=Forced rehab: A solution for Australia's grog addicts?|author=Fletcher, James|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 October 2013|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016081256/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24465989|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federally, a [[Opinion polling for the Australian federal election, 2016#Northern Territory|MediaReach seat-level opinion poll]] of 513 voters in the seat of [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]] conducted 22−23 June ahead of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]] held on 2 July surprisingly found Labor candidate [[Luke Gosling]] heavily leading two-term CLP incumbent [[Natasha Griggs]] 61–39 on the [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party]] vote from a large 12.4 percent [[Swing (Australian politics)|swing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/an-independent-poll-shows-solomon-mp-natasha-griggs-will-struggle-to-retain-her-seat-at-the-federal-election/news-story/187faae4f0bcbcbe0d2927227cec9b01 |title=An independent poll shows Solomon MP Natasha Griggs will struggle to retain her seat at the federal election |publisher=NT News |date=2016-06-27 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLP lost Solomon to Labor at the election, with Gosling defeating Griggs 56–44 on the two-party vote from a 7.4 percent swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Australian Electoral Commission |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionPage-20499-307.htm |title=Solomon, NT - Tally Room: Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Vtr.aec.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812133624/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionPage-20499-307.htm |archivedate=12 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 27 August Territory election, the CLP was swept from power in a massive Labor landslide, suffering easily the worst defeat of a sitting government in Territory history.  The party not only lost all of the bush seats it picked up in 2012, but was all but shut out of Darwin/Palmerston, winning only one seat there.  All told, the CLP only won two seats, easily its worst showing in an election.  Giles himself lost his own seat, becoming the second Majority Leader/Chief Minister to lose his own seat.  Even before Giles' defeat was confirmed, second-term MP [[Gary Higgins]]—the only surviving member of the Giles cabinet—was named the party's new leader, with [[Lia Finocchiaro]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/gary-higgins-becomes-country-liberals-new-leader-in-nt/7810772 | title=Gary Higgins becomes Country Liberals' new leader, Lia Finnochiaro his deputy | work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=2 September 2016 | accessdate=2 September 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903130953/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/gary-higgins-becomes-country-liberals-new-leader-in-nt/7810772 | archivedate=3 September 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the spring of 2016, the party website had turned into a redirect to its Facebook page. However, a full site was rolled back out in 2018.

==Ideology==
The CLP stands for office in the Northern Territory Assembly and [[Federal Parliament of Australia]] and primarily concerns itself with representing Territory interests. It is a regionally based party, that has parliamentary representation in both the Federal Parliament and at the Territory level.

The CLP competes against the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)]] (the local branch of Australia's [[social democracy|social-democratic]] party). It is closely affiliated with, but is independent from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] (a mainly urban, pro-private enterprise party comprising mainly [[liberalism|liberal]] membership) and the [[National Party of Australia]] (a conservative-liberal [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and regional interests party).&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parties_countrylib.htm |title=Parliament @ Work - The Country Liberal Party (CLP) |publisher=Parliament.curriculum.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218171746/http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parties_countrylib.htm |archivedate=18 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party promotes traditional Liberal Party values such as [[individualism]] and [[private enterprise]], and what it describes as "progressive" political policy such as [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|full statehood]] for the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/&gt;

==Organisation==
Branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council attend the Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party to decide the party's platform. The Central Council is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders from the Territory Assembly and the Federal Parliament and representatives of party branches.&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/&gt;

The Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party, attended by branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council, decides matters relating to the party's platform and philosophy. The Central Council administers the party and makes decisions on [[pre-selection]]s. It is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, members in the Federal Parliament, and representation from each of the party's branches.&lt;ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/&gt;

The CLP president has full voting rights with the National Party and observer status with the Liberal Party. Both the Liberals and Nationals receive Country Liberal delegations at their conventions. After federal elections, the CLP directs its federal members and senators as to which of the two other parties they should sit with in the parliamentary chamber. In practice, CLP House members usually sit with the Liberals, while CLP Senators sit with the Nationals.

'''Cultural diversity''' is the quality of diverse or different cultures, as opposed to [[Monoculturalism|monoculture]], the global monoculture, or a homogenization of cultures, akin to cultural decay. The phrase cultural diversity can also refer to having different cultures respect each other's differences. The phrase "cultural diversity" is also sometimes used to mean the variety of human [[societies]] or [[culture]]s in a specific region, or in the world as a whole. [[Globalization]] is often said to have a negative effect on the world's cultural diversity.

==Overview==
Diversity refers to the attributes that people use to confirm themselves with respect to others, “that person is different from me.” These attributes include demographic factors (such as race, gender, and age) as well as values and cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ferris, D. Frink, and M.C. Galang, “Diversity in the Workplace: The Human Resources Management Challenge,” Human Resource Planning 16, no. 1 (1993), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The many separate societies that emerged around the globe differs markedly from each other, and many of these differences persist to this day. The more obvious cultural differences that exist between people are language, dress and traditions, there are also significant variations in the way societies organize themselves, such as in their shared conception of [[morality]], religious belief, and in the ways they interact with their environment. Cultural diversity can be seen as analogous to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], Article 1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:London 1100055.jpg|thumb|300px|right|People of various cultural background in a park in [[London]]]]

==Opposition and support==
By analogy with biodiversity, which is thought to be essential to the long-term survival of life on earth, it can be argued that cultural diversity may be vital for the long-term survival of humanity; and that the conservation of [[indigenous culture]]s may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species and [[ecosystem]]s is to life in general.  The General Conference of [[UNESCO]] took this position in 2001, asserting in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity that ''"...cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature"''&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Universal Declaration On Cultural Diversity|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001271/127160m.pdf|work=UNESCO Universal Declaration On the Cultural Diversity|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=24 July 2012|author=UNESCO|language=French, English, Spanish, Russian, Japanese|format=PDF|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position is rejected by some people,{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} on several grounds.  Firstly, like most [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] accounts of [[human nature]], the importance of cultural diversity for survival may be an [[un-testable hypothesis]], which can neither be proved nor disproved. Secondly, it can be argued that it is unethical deliberately to conserve "less developed" societies, because this will deny people within those societies the benefits of technological and medical advances enjoyed by those in the "developed" world.

In the same manner that the promotion of poverty in underdeveloped nations as "cultural diversity" is [[Ethics|unethical]]. It is unethical to promote all religious practices simply because they are seen to contribute to cultural diversity. Particular religious practices are recognized by the WHO and UN as unethical, including [[female genital mutilation]], [[polygamy]], [[Child marriage|child brides]], and [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Amory|author2=Jason Adams|title=Anti-globalization: The Global Fight for Local Autonomy|journal=New Political Science|year=2003|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–42|doi=10.1080/0739314032000071217|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/0739314032000071217#tabModule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of globalization, traditional nation-states have been placed under enormous pressures. Today, with the development of technology, information and capital are transcending geographical boundaries and reshaping the relationships between the marketplace, states and citizens. In particular, the growth of the mass media industry has largely impacted on individuals and societies across the globe.  Although beneficial in some ways, this increased accessibility has the capacity to negatively affect a society's individuality.  With information being so easily distributed throughout the world, cultural meanings, values and tastes run the risk of becoming homogenized.  As a result, the strength of identity of individuals and societies may begin to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/law/tlc/docs/211020062211418ry4cq.pdf|title=Error (404)|website=The University of Sydney}}{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MywOAoRdJP4C&amp;pg=PR9|title=Alternatives to Economic Globalization: A Better World Is Possible|first1=John|last1=Cavanagh|first2=Jerry|last2=Mander|date=10 October 2004|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9781605094090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals, particularly those with strong religious beliefs, maintain that it is in the best interests of individuals and of humanity as a whole that all people adhere to a specific model for society or specific aspects of such a model.

Nowadays, communication between different countries becomes more and more frequent. And more and more students choose to study overseas for experiencing culture diversity. Their goal is to broaden their horizons and develop themselves from learning overseas. For example, according to Fengling, Chen, Du Yanjun, and Yu Ma's paper "Academic Freedom in the People's Republic of China and the United States Of America.", they pointed out that Chinese education more focus on "traditionally, teaching has consisted of spoon feeding, and learning has been largely by rote. China's traditional system of education has sought to make students accept fixed and ossified content." And "In the classroom, Chinese professors are the laws and authorities; Students in China show great respect to their teachers in general." On another hand, in United States of America education "American students treat college professors as equals." Also "American students' are encouraged to debate topics. The free open discussion on various topics is due to the academic freedom which most American colleges and universities enjoy." Discussion above gives us an overall idea about the differences between China and the United States on education. But we cannot simply judge which one is better, because each culture has its own advantages and features.  Thanks to those difference forms the culture diversity and those make our world more colorful. For students who go abroad for education, if they can combine positive culture elements from two different cultures to their self-development, it would be a competitive advantage in their whole career. Especially, with current process of global economics, people who owned different perspectives on cultures stand at a more competitive position in current world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fengling | first1 = Chen | last2 = Yanjun | first2 = Du | last3 = Ma | first3 = Yu | year = 1991 | title = Academic Freedom In The People's Republic Of China And The United States Of America | url = | journal = Education | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 29–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantification==
Cultural diversity is difficult to quantify, but a good indication is thought to be a count of the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole.  By this measure we may be going through a period of precipitous decline in the world's cultural diversity.  Research carried out in the 1990s by [[David Crystal]] (Honorary Professor of [[Linguistics]] at the [[University of Wales, Bangor]]) suggested that at that time, on average, one language was falling into disuse every two weeks.  He calculated that if that rate of the [[language death]] were to continue, then by the year 2100 more than 90% of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521012716 David Crystal ''Language Death'' Cambridge University Press, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]], [[immigration]] and [[imperialism]] (of both the militaristic and [[Cultural imperialism|cultural]] kind) are reasons that have been suggested to explain any such decline. However, it could also be argued that with the advent of globalism, a decline in cultural diversity is inevitable because information sharing often promotes homogeneity.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Chinatown Sydney.jpg|thumb|Sydney's [[Chinatown]]]]
The [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 2001 is a legal instrument that recognizes cultural diversity as "common heritage of humanity" and considers its safeguarding to be a concrete and ethical imperative inseparable from respect for human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity: UNESCO|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 at the Geneva Phase of the World Summit on the information Society (WSIS), the UNESCO [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]], adopted in October 2005, is a legally binding instrument to all States Parties to the Convention that recognizes
* The distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning;
* That while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/|title=Diversity of Cultural Expressions |website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was adopted in response to "growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf|title=CDC - CCD|last=cdc-ccd.org|website=www.cdc-ccd.org|access-date=2017-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044832/http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, 116 member states as well as the [[European Union]] have ratified the Convention, except the US, Australia and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Violaine (2011), "Building Medias Industry while promoting a community of values in the globalization: from quixotic choices to pragmatic boon for EU Citizens", Politické Védy-Journal of Political Science, Slovakia.&lt;/ref&gt; States Parties recognize the specificity of cultural goods and services, as well as state sovereignty and public services in this area. Thought for world trade, this soft law instrument (strength in not binding) clearly became a crucial reference to the definition of the European policy choice. In 2009, the European Court of Justice favoured a broad view of culture—beyond cultural values through the protection of film or the objective of promoting [[linguistic diversity]] yet previously recognized. On top of it, under this Convention, the EU and China have committed to fostering more balanced cultural exchanges, strengthening international cooperation and solidarity with business and trade opportunities in cultural and creative industries. The most motivating factor behind Beijing's willingness to work in partnership at business level might certainly be the access to creative talents and skills from foreign markets.

There is also the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage ratified on June 20, 2007 by 78 states which said: {{quote|The [[intangible cultural heritage]], transmitted from generation to generation is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and gives them a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.}}

Cultural diversity was also promoted by the Montreal Declaration of 2007, and by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diversite-culturelle.qc.ca/index.php?id=105&amp;L=1&amp;tx_bulletinsirre_pi2%5Byear%5D=2007&amp;tx_bulletinsirre_pi2%5Barticle%5D=872|title=The Montréal Declaration : Cultural diversity|website=www.diversite-culturelle.qc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/culture_en|title=Culture in the European Union - European Union - European Commission|last=Anonymous|date=2016-06-16|website=European Union|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a global multicultural heritage covers several ideas, which are not exclusive (see [[multiculturalism]]). In addition to language, diversity can also include religious or traditional practice.

On a local scale, [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document of world scope that establishes the foundations for a commitment by cities and local governments to cultural development, supports local authorities committed to cultural diversity.

The defense of cultural diversity can take several meanings:
* A balance to be achieved: thus, the idea of defense of cultural diversity through the promotion of actions in favor of "cultural minorities" said to be disadvantaged;
* Preservation of "cultural minorities" thought to be endangered;
* "Cultural protection" or "[[cultural exception]]" defends the social vision of culture against its commercialisation. The cultural exception highlights the specificity of cultural products and services, including special recognition by the European Union in its Declaration on Cultural Diversity. In this context, the objective is to defend against what is seen as a "[[commodification]]"—considered harmful to a "disadvantaged" culture—supporting its development through grants, promotion operations, etc., also known as "cultural protectionism".
* This defense may also refer to incorporating "cultural rights" provisions, conducted unsuccessfully in the early 1990s in Europe, into a layer of human rights.

===Cultural uniformity===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
{{see also|Cultural homogenization}}
In a specific occasion of social life, or custom, [[cultural uniformity]] can be observed and displayed in behaviors of a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studypoints.blogspot.com/2014/10/explain-cultural-uniformity-and.html|title=Explain cultural uniformity and cultural variability with examples|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural diversity is presented as the antithesis of cultural uniformity.

Some (including UNESCO) fear this hypothesis of a trend towards cultural uniformity. To support this argument they emphasize different aspects:
* The disappearance of many languages and dialects, regarding for example the languages of France, without legal status or protection (Breton, Corsican, Occitan, Alsatian, Flemish, Poitou, Saintonge, etc.).
* Anxiety of people on the preservation of their traditions as in New Zealand, coastal regions in Australia, North America, Central America;
* Increasing cultural preeminence of the United States through the distribution of its products in film, television, music, clothing and nutritional products promoted in audio-visual media, consumer products virtually standardized on the planet (pizza, restaurants, fast food, etc..).

There are several international organizations that work towards protecting threatened societies and cultures, including [[Survival International]] and [[UNESCO]]. The UNESCO [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], adopted by 185 Member States in 2001, represents the first international standard-setting instrument aimed at preserving and promoting cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue.&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"/&gt;

Indeed, the notion of "cultural diversity" has been echoed by more neutral organizations, particularly within the UNESCO. Beyond the Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 at the Geneva Phase of the World Summit on the information Society (WSIS), the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions was adopted on 20 October 2005, but neither ratified by the US, Australia nor by Israel. It is instead a clear recognition of the specificity of cultural goods and services, as well as state sovereignty and public services in this area. Thought for world trade, this soft law instrument (strength in not binding) clearly became a crucial reference to the definition of the European policy choice. In 2009, the [[European Court of Justice]] favoured a broad view of culture—beyond cultural values—through the protection of film or the objective of promoting linguistic diversity yet previously recognized. On top of it, under this Convention, the EU and China have committed to fostering more balanced cultural exchanges, strengthening international cooperation and solidarity with business and trade opportunities in cultural and creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Violaine (2011a), "Building Medias Industry while promoting a community of values in the globalization: from quixotic choices to pragmatic boon for EU Citizens", Politické Védy-Journal of Political Science, Slovakia, pp. 64-74&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]]-funded ''Network of Excellence on "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World"'' (known as "SUS.DIV") builds upon the UNESCO Declaration to investigate the relationship between cultural diversity and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susdiv.org SUS.DIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the legal doctrine|Judicial deference}}
{{hatnote|"Deferential" and "Submission" redirect here. Not to be confused with [[Difference (disambiguation)]] or [[Differential (disambiguation)]].}}
{{redirect-distinguish|Reverence (attitude)|Reverence (emotion)}}
'''Deference''' (also called '''submission''' or '''passivity''') is the condition of submitting to the espoused, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] influence of one's superior or superiors.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Kirbya, "Early American Politics—The Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'" ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808–838&lt;/ref&gt; Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by [[political scientists]], sociologists, and psychologists.

==Politics==
Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the "colonial speech economy," that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Smolenski, "From Men of Property to Just Men," ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay "The Nature of Deference and Demeanor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.

==Psychology==
There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.

In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">The '''delegate model of representation''' is a model of a [[representative democracy]]. In this model, [[Electoral district|constituents]] elect their representatives as [[delegates]] for their [[constituency]]. These delegates act only as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency/ state, and have no [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from the constituency only the autonomy to vote for the actual representatives of the state. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of those who are (literally) not present.

This model was contested by [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher, who also created the [[trustee model of representation]].

[[File:Domino theory.svg|thumb|350px|An illustration of the domino theory as it had been predicted]]

The '''domino theory''' was a theory prominent from the 1950s to the 1980s that posited that if one country in a region came under the influence of  [[communism]], then the surrounding countries would follow in a '''[[domino effect]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leeson|first1=Peter T.|last2=Dean|first2=Andrea|title=The Democratic Domino Theory|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=533–551|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the [[Cold War]] to justify the need for [[Overseas interventions of the United States|American intervention]] around the world.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described the theory during an April 7, 1954, news conference, when referring to communism in [[Indochina]]:

In 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by [[Mao Zedong]], was instated in China (officially becoming the [[China|People's Republic of China]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government | title =Mao Zedong outlines the new Chinese government | publisher =[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] | date =December 5, 2013 | access-date =2013-12-05 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131102093822/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government# | archive-date =2013-11-02 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of the new government was established after the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalist Republican Government of China]] in the aftermath of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1949).&lt;ref name="ChineseRev"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev | title =The Chinese Revolution of 1949 | publisher =[[United States Department of State]] [[Office of the Historian]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] | access-date =2017-06-14 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170519004017/https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev# | archive-date =2017-05-19 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Chinas were formed - mainland 'Communist China' (People's Republic of China) and 'Nationalist China' Taiwan ([[Taiwan|Republic of China]]). The takeover by Communists of the world's most populous nation was seen in the West as a great strategic loss, prompting the popular question at the time, "Who lost China?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3oay_KTHwoC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zJEMhUw3FQ&amp;sig=Hv-UEoi7Otexk7nArwaotvulO9E&amp;hl=en#PPA230,M1 Rogue Regimes: Terrorism and Proliferation, pg. 230], Raymond Tanter, Macmillan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The United States subsequently ended diplomatic relations with China in response to the communist takeover in 1949.&lt;ref name ="ChineseRev"/&gt;

[[Korea]] had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].
Mao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

President Eisenhower was the first to refer to countries in danger of Communist takeover as dominoes, in response to a journalist's question about Indochina in an April 7, 1954 news conference, though he did not use the term "domino theory".&lt;ref&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower: "[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202 The President's News Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033903/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202# |date=2017-12-01 }}," April 7, 1954.

In May 1954, the [[Viet Minh]], a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and took control of what became [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/asiapacific-region/french-indochinavietnam-1941-1954/ | title =11.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

Eisenhower's domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within [[Southeast Asia]] at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.

The [[John F. Kennedy]] administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese "domino" from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led [[Pathet Lao]] in Laos would provide the [[Viet Cong]] with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.

==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.

[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=467,573 |isbn=0-06-019776-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that "there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via CIA-supported death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e. Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

Linguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called "people's movements" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. "The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'" Chomsky refers to this as the "threat of a good example".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm "The Threat of a Good Example"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the "prestige" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the "Message to the Tricontinental", in 1967, calling for "two, three ... many Vietnams" across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm "Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, "In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS ''Mayaguez'' (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan]]. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567 "Another Vietnam?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709153053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567# |date=2017-07-09 }}, Max Boot, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |title=KGB Active Measures |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629193045/https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |title=Red Army Faction |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629203451/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |title=Brigate Rosse |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232055/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General [[James L. Dozier]], by the [[Red Brigades]].

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the [[Red Army Faction]]. In the far east the [[Japanese Red Army]] carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 [[The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon interviews]], [[Richard Nixon]] defended America's destabilization of the [[Salvador Allende]] regime in Chile on domino theory grounds.  Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and [[Cuba]] would create a "red sandwich" that could entrap Latin America between them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5mUrNoWa7J0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Chile%2Bcuba%2Bred+sandwich&amp;source=web&amp;ots=495XIVdXHA&amp;sig=-Cxk0QCxL6Ab82RqdR_fJINZ2mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Last Years of the Monroe Doctrine, 1945-1993, p. 133] Gaddis Smith&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s interventions in Central America and the [[Invasion of Grenada|Caribbean region]].

In his memoirs, former [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Rhodesian Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]] described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]] as "the communists' domino tactic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|Bitter Harvest: Zimbabwe and the Aftermath of Its Independence]] |last=Smith |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Smith |year=2008 |publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84358-548-0 |page=280 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of pro-communist governments in [[Tanzania]] (1961–64) and [[Zambia]] (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually [[Rhodesia]] itself (in 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 147&lt;/ref&gt; are cited by Smith as evidence of "the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent".&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Some foreign policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread of both Islamic theocracy and liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino theory. During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the United States and other western nations supported [[Ba'athist Iraq]], fearing the spread of Iran's radical theocracy throughout the region. In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], some [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]]s argued that when a democratic government is implemented, it would then help spread democracy and [[liberalism]] across the Middle East.

An '''elite pact, settlement''' or '''political settlement''' is an agreement or understanding between political elites which moderates the violence and winner takes all nature of unrestrained conflict.  Such settlements are often understood to transform government from an autocratic mode into more pluralistic, democratic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=John Higley, Michael Burton |title=Elite Settlements and the Taming of Politics |journal=Government and Opposition |volume=33 |issue=1 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.1998.tb00785.x |page=98 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcN252eB1gYC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Understanding democracy |author=Albert Breton |page=33 |chapter=Elite pacts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-521-58236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others view the political settlement as normatively neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/9968/1/Political_Settlements_internet.pdf Kahn, Mustaq 2010, Political Settlements and the Governance of Growth-enhancing Institutions, working paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept in political theory is part of [[elite theory]] and [[state-building]].  Joel Migdal has suggested that the concept of political settlements has a pedigree going back to the work of [[Barrington Moore]].  Political settlements are the frameworks for governing a state established by elites, either through formal processes or informally over time.  There are numerous definitions of political settlements and elite pacts, often including an emphasis on understandings between elites that bring about the conditions to end conflict, or maintain peace.  In 2011 the World Bank's World Development Report suggested a new terminology for political settlements with the concept of `good enough coalitions.'&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/WDR2011_Full_Text.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite pacts can be explicitly articulated (enshrined in an evolving
document – such as a peace agreement or a constitution).

Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal published a paper in 2007 arguing that political settlements are a `domain' at the heart of all state processe.  They relate the concept to broader state theory (including the issues of elections and legitimacy).  They stress that political settlements are not one-off events but evolve over time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odi.org.uk/pppg/politics_and_governance/publications/ODI_state_building_paper.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important contributions on the establishing of political settlements in modern (particularly newly democratic) states have also been made by [[Thomas Carothers]] and Marina Ottaway of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].  Also of note is JC Scott's work `[[Seeing Like a State]]' which explores the routes through which political settlements in medieval Europe began to consolidate formal state structures.

More recently Christine Bell of the [http://www.politicalsettlements.org/ Political Settlements Research Programme] has argued that political settlements analysis is centrally concerned with how to understand and support elite pacts while enabling transformation to other forms of broader inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Christine [http://www.politicalsettlements.org/files/2015/09/20150901-PSRP-Concepts-Working-Paper-1-1.pdf 'What we talk about when we talk about Political Settlements', PSRP Working paper 1, 1 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In political science the concept of `political settlements' is distinct from short-term processes aimed at elite agreements, such as a `peace process' or `peace agreement.'  Peace negotiations and agreements may be part of the process of achieving a political settlement, but the settlement itself is the period of time for which an elite agreement holds, which could last for days or centuries.

Controversially the political scientist [[Patrick Chabal]] has suggested that the concept of political settlements is often less useful than that of `political sedimentation,' the residue of elite accommodation that is left after a period of contestation or explicit conflict, (quoted from Whaites above) see also.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/Expert-feedback.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term political settlement is now use by key development agencies, despite confusion over what exactly the term  means, and doubts over how the concept assists development actors intervene more effectively to support stable, open and inclusive political settlement.

{{Public finance}}
'''Equity of condition''' in tax law and governmental spending is the economic condition, often arbitrary, that political leaders believe a person should be in after governmental [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[redistribution of wealth]]. The award or redistribution of wealth to the recipients overrides, substantially, any [[natural right]] of the producers of the wealth to keep the fruits of their labor.

The award of wealth in a socialist economy may be extensive, with a proscribed level of benefits for food, housing, health, education, recreation, welfare, etcetera—and have little or no relation to the citizen’s productivity (e.g., before-tax income). The result, however, is that economic productivity and the [[standard of living]] can be lessened in a socialist economy due to disincentive to production.

Equity of condition in a [[mixed economy]], such as the United States, can be nebulous and ever-changing. Governmental subsidies and tax deductions may be extended for political reasons, and a political leader may never provide comprehensive economic rationale for his particular fiscal policy actions. The cost of the benefits is merely shifted to a discriminated portion of the tax base. Benefits may also be illusory to recipients, because further political manipulation of the tax code by political leaders can nullify the recipients’ original gains.

{{Conservatism US|Schools}}
'''Fiscal conservatism''' (also '''economic conservatism''' or '''conservative economics''') is a political-economic philosophy regarding [[fiscal policy]] and [[fiscal responsibility]] advocating low taxes, reduced government spending and minimal government debt.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=392}} [[Free trade]], [[deregulation]] of the economy, [[Tax cut|lower taxes]], and [[privatization]] are the defining qualities of fiscal conservatism. Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical  outlook of [[classical liberalism]] and [[economic liberalism]].{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=210}} The term has its origins in the era of the [[New Deal]] during the 1930s as a result of the policies initiated by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|reform or modern liberals]], when many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was passing for liberalism.{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=99}}

In the United States the term liberalism has become associated with the welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created as a result of the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the United States, together with [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]] and national defense conservatism.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as [[libertarian]],{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=100}} holding more socially liberal views and advocating a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist foreign policy]] while supporting lower taxes and less government spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}

==Overview==
===Principles===
Fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure |first=Robert M. |last=Freeman |publisher=Elsevier |year=1999 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of [[deficit spending]], the reduction of overall [[government spending]] and [[national debt]], and ensuring [[balanced budget]]s. In other words, fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt, but will usually choose debt over tax increases.

[[Edmund Burke]], in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied&amp;nbsp;... [T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Factions or subgroups===
Although all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government there are disagreements over priorities.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis.
[[Deficit hawk]]s emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt, viewing government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in present-day tax and spending decisions.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}

A second group put their main emphasis on [[Tax cut#Tax cuts in the United States|tax cuts]] rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace [[supply-side economics]], arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} These additional government revenues, would in the long term reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the [[Bush tax cuts]] added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011&lt;ref name=CBO_Change2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463|title=CBO Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001|website=CBO|date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009–2019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes, this group emphasizes reduction in [[Government spending|spending]] rather than tax policy or debt reduction.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}} They argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}}

==History in the United States==

===18th and 19th centuries===
The [[Democratic-Republican Party]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]] supported a weak [[central government]] and a more ''[[laissez-faire]]'' approach than that of the [[Federalist Party]] of Jefferson's rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. They opposed Hamilton's plan to pay off the debts owed by the states for the expense of the American Revolution, because some of the debt was held by financiers and speculators (rather than the original holders) and because most of the debt was held by northern states. Hamilton passed his legislation and set up taxes to pay the debts. In exchange, he agreed to let Jefferson move the nation's capital to [[Washington, D.C.]]

Jefferson strongly opposed having any national debt, but he relented in 1803 for the sake of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. [[James Madison]] and [[James Monroe]] were elected by the Democratic-Republican Party, but after the fiscal disasters of the [[War of 1812]], they came to support most Federalist positions and decided that the nation needed a central bank and a steady income flow from tariffs.

===Early to mid 20th century===
[[File:Hoover Campaign.jpg|right|thumb|[[Herbert Hoover]] addresses a large crowd in his 1932 campaign.]]
In the early 20th century fiscal conservatives were often at odds with [[progressivism|progressives]] who desired economic reform.
During the 1920s, President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pro-business economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the "Roaring Twenties."  His actions, however, may have been due more to a sense of [[federalism]] than fiscal conservatism: [[Robert Sobel]] notes, "As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coolidge and American Business|url=http://coolidgefoundation.org/resources/essays-papers-addresses-35/|publisher=Calvin-Coolidge.org|accessdate=May 14, 2015|author=Robert Sobel|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative economic and fiscal policies of [[Herbert Hoover]] are often popularly contrasted with the [[New Deal]] deficit spending of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of Truman and Eisenhower. [[Barry Goldwater]] was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative Republicans.

===Reagan era===
[[File:Federal Spending by President - Carter to Obama - v1.png|thumb|left|350px|Reagan spent the most of any recent President, measured as annual average % GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#2 CBO Historical Budget Data April 2018-Retrieved June 25, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Reaganomics}}
Fiscal conservatism was rhetorically promoted during the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1989). During Reagan's tenure, the top personal income [[tax bracket]] dropped from 70% to 28%,&lt;ref name="The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates"&gt;{{cite web | author = Daniel J.

Employment grew at about the same rate as population.

According to a [[United States Department of the Treasury]] nonpartisan economic study, the major tax bills enacted under Reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1% of GDP.&lt;ref name=taxtable&gt;{{cite journal|author=[http://www.treasury.gov/offices/tax-policy/offices/ota.shtml Office of Tax Analysis] |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |title=Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills |work=2003, rev.

In fewer than eight years, the U.S. went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26402-2004Jun8.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Reagan Policies Gave Green Light to Red Ink | date=June 9, 2004 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ross Perot===
{{Main|Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992}}
In the 1992 Presidential election, [[Ross Perot]], a successful American businessman, ran as a third-party candidate.  Despite significant campaign stumbles, and the uphill struggles involved in mounting a third-party candidacy, Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote (the largest percentage of any third-party candidate in modern history), largely on the basis of his central platform plank of limited-government, balanced-budget fiscal conservatism.

===Clinton era===
{{main|Clintonomics}}
[[File:Average US Federal Tax Rates 1979 to 2013.png|thumb|350px|The Ominibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the average federal tax rates for the top 1%, while lowering average tax rates for the middle class. President Obama also raised tax rates for higher income persons starting in 2013, through the partial expiration of the [[Bush tax cuts]]. The Clinton and Obama tax increases lowered deficits relative to CBO policy baselines without them.]]
While the mantle of fiscal conservatism is most commonly claimed by Republicans and [[libertarians]], it is also claimed in some ways by many [[Democratic Party (United States)#Centrists|centrist]] or [[Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)#Moderate Democrats|moderate]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who often refer to themselves as "[[New Democrats]]". Although not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan and Bush administrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-22/news/9307220038_1_income-tax-rolls-tax-code-top-rate|title=Clinton Won't Restore Punitive Taxation-not Today|author=Stephen Chapman|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 22, 1993|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ippqvab /&gt; the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional philosophy held by liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that a balanced federal budget should take precedence over some spending programs.&lt;ref name=ippqvab&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/108724/brief-history-trickle-down-government|title=A Brief History Of "Trickle-Down Government"|author=Timothy Nolan|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former President [[Bill Clinton]], who was a New Democrat and part of the somewhat fiscally conservative [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] advocating [[Democratic Leadership Council]], is a prime example of this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton’s economic legacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1110165.stm|title= Bill Clinton's economic legacy|author=Steve Schifferes|publisher=BBC News|date= January 15, 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during the Clinton years, the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the [[Budget Enforcement Act of 1990]] (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with [[deficit hawk]]s) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002.

In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a platform that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman [[Newt Gingrich]] called the [[Contract with America]], which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a [[line-item veto]], and [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]]. After the [[Republican Revolution|elections]] gave the Republicans a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], newly minted [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|1995–1996 government shutdown]]. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which lowered the top [[capital gains tax]] rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.

After this combination of tax hikes and spending reductions, the United States was able to create [[budget surplus]]es from fiscal years 1998-2001 (the first time since 1969), and the longest period of sustained [[economic growth]] in United States history.&lt;ref name="President Clinton announces another record budget surplus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/27/clinton.surplus/ |title= President Clinton announces another record budget surplus| author=Kelly Wallace|publisher=CNN|date= September 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinton announces record payment on national debt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/01/clinton.debt/|title= Clinton announces record payment on national debt|author=John King|publisher=CNN|date= May 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton|title=The Budget and Deficit Under Clinton|author=Brooks Jackson|date=February 3, 2008|website=FactCheck.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern fiscal conservatism in the United States===
[[File:CBO Forecast Comparison - Obama and GW Bush - v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Comparison of annual federal deficits (CBO 10-year forecast from prior to inauguration vs. the actual amount), during the Obama and G.W. Bush presidencies. Bush added far more to the debt relative to the CBO 2001 forecast than Obama added relative to the CBO 2009 forecast.]]

American businessman, politician, and former [[Mayor of New York City]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], considers himself a fiscal conservative and expressed his definition of the term at the 2007 [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] Conference: &lt;blockquote&gt;"To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets&amp;nbsp;– not running deficits that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it.

The NYT reported in July 2018 that: "The top-earning 1 percent of households — those earning more than $607,000 a year — will pay a combined $111 billion less this year in federal taxes than they would have if the laws had remained unchanged since 2000. That’s an enormous windfall. It’s more, in total dollars, than the tax cut received over the same period by the entire bottom 60 percent of earners." This represents the tax cuts for the top 1% from the [[Bush tax cuts]] and [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Trump tax cuts]], partially offset by the tax increases on the top 1% by Obama.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/trump-republicans-tax-cuts-inequality.html NYT-David Leonhardt-$111 Billion in Tax Cuts for the Top 1 Percent-July 11, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rest of the world==
As a result of the expansion of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term ''liberalism'' in the United States today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by [[socialist]] or [[social democratic]] parties such as the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] rather than liberal parties.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in Germany being one example.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party.

Fiscal conservatism in the UK was arguably most popular during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who, after a number of years of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. In 2010, as a result of the deterioration in the UK's public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, the [[late-2000s recession]] and by the [[European sovereign debt crisis]]—the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition]] embarked on an [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity programme]], featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises, in an attempt to halve the [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] and completely eliminate the [[structural deficit]] over the five-year parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundstrategy.co.uk/markets/britain/budget-structural-deficit-to-be-balanced-by-2015/1013834.article|title=Budget: Structural deficit to be balanced by 2015|author=|date=June 22, 2010|website=Fund Strategy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713000832/http://www.fundstrategy.co.uk/markets/britain/budget-structural-deficit-to-be-balanced-by-2015/1013834.article|archive-date=July 13, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the proposal of [[Jules Vuillemin]], a chair in the department of Philosophy and History was created at [[Collège de France]] to replace the late [[Jean Hyppolite]]. The title of the new chair was ''The history of systems of thought'' and it was created on 30 November 1969. Vuillemin put forward the then-little known outside the shores of France-philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] - to the general assembly of professors and Foucault was duly elected on 12 April 1970. He was 44 years old. As required by this appointment he held a series of public lectures from 1970 until his death in 1984. These lectures in which he further advanced his work, were summarised from audio recordings and edited by Michel Senellart. They were subsequently translated into English and further edited by Graham Burchell and published posthumously by St Martin's Press.

==''Lectures On The Will To Know'' (1970–1971)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This was an important time for Foucault and marks an important switch of methodology from ‘archaeology’ to ‘genealogy’ (according to Foucault he never abandoned the archaeology method). This was also a period of transition of thought for Foucault; the Dutch TV-televised Foucault [[Noam Chomsky]] ''Human nature Justice versus Power debate'' of November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology appears at this exact time period as his first inaugural lecture were delivered at the [[Collège de France]] entitled "the Order Of Discourse" delivered on 2 December 1970 (translated and published into English as "The Discourse On Language") then a week later (9 December 1970) his first ever full inaugural lecture course was delivered at the Collège de France "The Will to Knowledge" course Foucault promised to explore; "fragment by fragment," the "morphology of the will to knowledge," through alternating historical periods, inquiries and theoretical questioning. The lectures produced were called "Lectures On The Will To Know"; all of this within a space of a year.

The first phase of Foucault’s thought is characterized by knowledge construction of various types and how each thread of knowledge systems combine together to produce a series of networks (Foucault uses the term ‘Grille’) to produce a successful fully functional ‘subject’ and a workable fully functional human society. Foucault uses the terms ''[[epistemological]] indicators'' and ''epistemological breaks'' to show, contrary to popular opinion, that these "indicators" and "breaks" require skilled trained technical group of ‘specialists’ in the various knowledge fields and a trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body of which know-how on behalf of those who use the terms (discourse formations or "speech/discourse") with a professional body that can make the terms used stand up to further rational scrutiny. Scientific knowledge for Foucault isn’t an advancement for human progress as is so often portrayed by the human sciences (such as the humanities and the social sciences) but is much more of a subtle method of organizing and producing firstly an individual subject, and secondly, a fully functional society functioning as a self-replicated control apparatus not as a group of ‘free’ atomized individuals but as a collective societal, organised (or drilled) unit both in terms of industrial [[Economics|Production]], [[labour power]] and a militarily organized unit (in the guise of armies) which is beneficial for the production of "epistemological indicators" or "breaks" enabling society to "control itself" rather than have external factors (such as the state for example) to do the job.

In the inaugural lecture course "The Will To Know" Foucault goes into detail on how the ‘natural order of things’ from the 16th century transpired into a fully organised human society which includes a "[[Governmentality]]" apparatus and a complex machine (by "governmentaility", Foucault means a state apparatus which is conceived as a scientific machine) as a rational organizing principle. This was the first time (contrary to popular opinion that this was a rather late invention in Foucault’s thought) that Foucault started to go into the Greek dimensions of his thought of which he would return to in later lectures towards the end of his life. First of all a few pointers should be made explicit on certain points. Foucault mentions the western notion of by [[money]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] (Greek society) starting about 800 BCE to 700 BCE. However, other ‘non-western’ societies also had these very same problems and is automatically assumed by some historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} that these were entirely western inventions. This isn’t entirely true; [[China]] and [[India]] for example had the most sophisticated trading and monetary institutions by the 6th century B.C.E., indeed the concept of a ''[[corporation]]'' existed in India&lt;ref&gt;[[Chanakya]] [[Arthashastra]] Translated by R Shamasastry pp. 541–547&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 800 BCE and lasted until at least 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;"The examination reveals that business people on the Indian subcontinent utilized the corporate form from a very early period. The corporate form (e.g., the [[Shreni]]) was being used in India from at least 800 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, and was in more or less continuous
use since then until the advent of the Islamic invasions around 1000 A.D.
This provides evidence for the use of the corporate form centuries before the earliest Roman proto-corporations.
In fact, the use of the sreni in Ancient India was widespread including virtually
every kind of business, political and municipal activity. Moreover, when we examine how
these entities were structured, governed and regulated we find that they bear many
similarities to corporations and, indeed, to modern US corporations. The familiar concerns
of agency costs and incentive effects are both present and addressed in quite similar ways as
are many other aspects of the law regulating business entities. Further, examining the
historical development of the sreni indicates that the factors leading to the growth of this
corporate form are consistent with those put forward for the growth of organizational
entities in Europe. These factors include increasing trade, methods to contain agency costs,
and methods to patrol the boundaries between the assets of the sreni and those of its
members (i.e., to facilitate asset partitioning and reduce creditor information costs)." Vikramaditya S. Khanna ''The Economic History Of The Corporate Form In Ancient India 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly there was a [[social security]] system in India at this time. Foucault begins his notions from these lectures on the very notion of truth and the ‘Will to knowledge’ and the challenge is on when Foucault asks the very question of the entire western philosophical and political tradition: Namely knowledge (at least scientific knowledge) and its close association with truth is entirely desirable and is politically and philosophically natural and neutral. First of all Foucault puts these notions (at least its political notions) to a thorough test, firstly, Foucault asks the politically ‘neutral’ question on the very first appearance of money which became not only an important economic symbol but above all else became a measure of value and a unit of account.

Money once established as a social process and social reality had (if one could say the word) an extremely rocky and precarious history. First of all while it had a social reality but the actual social authority to use money didn’t develop a standard practice or knowledge on how to use it; it was rather undisciplined. Kings and emperors could squander large taxation revenues with impunity regardless of the consequences.They could default on repayments on loans as witnessed during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] (1627-1629).&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Kaeuper ''Bankers to the Crown: The Riccardi of Lucca and Edward I''  1973&lt;/ref&gt; Above all else kings and monarchs could take out forced loans and get others(their subjects) to pay for these forced loans and to add insult to injury get them to pay interest on the loans at extortionate rates of interest charged on the loans because they and their advisers regarded it as their own ‘income’. However, whole societies were dependent on money particularly when the whole of society had to use and be ready for its function.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls February 1255 pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls July 1255 pp. 439–440&lt;/ref&gt; Money took at least 3,000 years of history to get a more disciplined approach and became the sole prerogative of the fiscal responsibility of the state after the medieval ‘order of things’ was entirely dismantled ‘to get it right’ namely; the ruthlessness and rigorous efficiency needed for its proper function and it wasn’t until the 16th century with the advent of modern [[political economy]] with its analysis of production, [[Labour economics|labour]] and trade you then get a sense of why money, particularly its relationship with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and its complex relationship with the rest of society conversion, from labour power into money via the essential route of [[surplus value]] became a much maligned and misunderstood category and hot potato. This is where Foucault is at his most profound. Foucault now is asking how is it that modern western political economy, together with [[political philosophy]] and [[political science]] came to ask the question concerning money but was utterly perplexed by it (this is a question that particularly irritated and irked [[Karl Marx]] throughout his life)? That money and its various association with production, labour, government and trade was beyond doubt but its exact relationship with the rest of society was entirely missed by economists but yet still its version of events was entirely accepted as true? Foucault begins to try to go into the whole production of truth (both philosophical and political) its whole “breaks” “discontinuity” 'epistemological unconscious' and theoretical splitting “[[Episteme]]”. From this Greek period starting from 800 BCE Foucault pursues the path of scientific and political knowledge the emergence and conditions of possibility for philosophical knowledge and ends up with “the problem of political knowledge (i.e. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] notions of the political animal) of what is necessary in order to govern the city and put it right.” He then divided his work on the history of systems of thought into three interrelated parts, the “re-examination of knowledge, the conditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.”

==''The Punitive Society'' (1972–1973)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In these lectures, published in English in 2015, Foucault uses the first precursor of [[Discipline and Punish]] to study the foundations of what he calls “disciplinary institutions”(punitive power) and the productive dimensions of penalty. Foucault spent a lot of time during this period trying to make intelligible the internal and external dynamics of what we call the prison. He questioned, "What are the relations of power which made possible the historical emergence of something like the prison?". This was correlated to three terms; firstly ‘measure’ "a means of establishing or restoring order, the right order, in the combat of men or the elements; but also a matrix of mathematical and physical knowledge."(treated in more detail in ''The Will To Knowledge'' lectures of 1971); Secondly the ‘inquiry’ "a means of establishing or restoring facts, events, actions, properties, rights; but also a matrix of empirical knowledge and natural sciences"(from the 1972 lectures ''Theories On Punishment and Penal Theories and Institutions'') and thirdly ‘the examination’ treated as "the permanent control of the individual, like a permanent test with no endpoint". Foucault links the examination with 18th century [[Political economy]] and the productive labourers with the wealth they produce and the forces of production.

==''"Society Must Be Defended"'' (1975–1976)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This series of lectures forms a trilogy with [[Security, Territory, Population]] and [[The Birth of Biopolitics]], and it contains Foucault's first discussion of [[biopower]]. It also contains an explanation of the term "Civil war" in the form of rigorous treatment of a working definition. Foucault goes into great detail how power (as Foucault saw it) becomes a battleground drifting from civil war to generalized pacification of the individual and particularly the systems he (the individual) relies upon and to which he gives loyalty: "According to this hypothesis, the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to re-inscribe that relationship of force, and to re-inscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals." Foucault begins to explain that this generalized form of power is not only rooted in [[Disciplinary institutions]] but is also concentrated in "political sovereignty, the military, and war," so it is in turn spread evenly throughout modern society as a network of domination.

Foucault then discusses what lies behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement of history and power (bio-power). What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign is presented in the text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power ([[Disciplinary institutions]]) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘[[paradigms]],’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians Foucault argues, was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power "It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a "genealogical" mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of [[Mercantilism]], [[Statistics]] ([[mathematical statistics]]) and [[political economy]] this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called [[Nation states]] where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a "[[thanatopolitics]]"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.

This is where Foucault discusses a "counterhistory" of "race struggle or race war."According to Foucault Marx and Engels used or borrowed the term "Race" and transversed the term race into a new term called "[[Class struggle]]" which later [[Marxist]] accepted and began to use. This is more partly to do with Marx's antagonistic relationship with [[Karl Vogt]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''  Karl Marx ''Herr Vogt'' 1860&lt;/ref&gt; who for his time was a convinced [[Polygenist]] which Marx and Engels had inherited Vogt's belief. Foucault quotes letters written by Marx to Engels in 1854 and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] in 1852 {{cquote|Finally, in your place I should in general remark to the democratic gentlemen that they would do better first to acquaint themselves with bourgeois literature before they presume to yap at the opponents of it. For instance, these gentlemen should study the historical works of [[Augustin Thierry]], [[François Guizot]], [[John Wade (author)|John Wade]], and others in order to enlighten themselves as to the past 'history of classes.'Where the history of the revolutionary project and of revolutionary practice is indissoluble from this counterhistory of races&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be defended'' pp.79-80, p.85 1975-1976&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

Foucault challenges the traditional notions of racism in explaining the operation of the modern state. When Foucault talks of racism he is not talking about what we might traditionally understand it to be–an ideology, a mutual hatred. In Foucault’s reckoning modern racism is tied to power, making it something far more profound than traditionally assumed.&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;Foucault, M. (2003). Society must be defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–76, trans. David Macey. New York: Picador&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing the genealogy of racism, Foucault proposes that ‘race’, previously used to describe the division between two opposing societal groups distinguished from one another for example by religion or language, came to be conceived in the late 18th century in biological terms. The concept of "race war" that referred to conflict over the legitimacy of the power of the established sovereign, was "reformulated" into a struggle for existence driven by concern about the biopolitical purity of the population as a single race that could be threatened from within its own body. For Foucault "racism is born at the point when the theme of racial purity replaces that of race struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

For Foucault, racism "is an expression of a schism within society…provoked by the idea of an ongoing and always incomplete cleaning of the social body…it structures social fields of action, guides political practice, and is realized through state apparatuses…it is concerned with biological purity and conformity with the norm" (pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).&lt;ref name="Lemke"&gt;Lemke, T. (2011). Biopolitics. An Advanced Introduction. (Trans. E.F. Trump). New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern states, racism is not defined by the action of individuals, rather it is vested in the State and finds form in its structures and operation–it is State racism.

State racism serves two functions. Firstly, it makes it possible to divide the population into biological groups, "good and bad" or "superior or inferior" ‘races’. Fragmented into subspecies, the population can be brought under State control. Secondly, it facilitates a dynamic relationship between the life of one person and the death of another. Foucault is clear that this relationship is not one of warlike confrontation but rather a biological one, that is not based on the individual but rather on life in general "the more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I – as species rather than individual – can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be, I will be able to proliferate" (p.&amp;nbsp;255)&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

In effect race, defined in biological terms, "furnished the ideological foundation for identifying, excluding, combating, and even murdering others, all in the name of improving life not of an individual but of life in general" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="Lemke" /&gt; What is important here is that racism, inscribed as one of the modern state’s basic techniques of power, allows enemies to be treated as threats, not political adversaries. But through what mechanism are these threats treated? Here the technologies of power described by Foucault become important.

Foucault argues that new technologies of power emerged in the second half of the 18th century, which Foucault termed biopolitics and biopower(Foucault uses both terms synonymously), these technologies focused on man-as-species and were concerned with optimising the state of life, with taking control of life and intervening to "make live and let die".&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Importantly, Foucault argues, the technologies did not replace the technologies of sovereign power with their exclusive focus on disciplining the individual body to be more productive by punishing or killing individuals, but embedded themselves into them. It was in exploring how this new power, with life as its object, could come to include the power to kill that Foucault theorizes the emergence of state racism.

Foucault argues that the modern state must at some point become involved with racism in order to function since once a State functions in a biopolitical mode it is racism alone that can justify killing.&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;  Determined as a threat to the population, the State can take action to kill in the name of keeping the population safe and thriving, healthy and pure. It is racism that allows the right to kill to be squared off with a power that seeks to improve life. State racism delivers actions that while appearing to derive from altruistic intentions, veil the murder of the "Other"&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, M. (2004). Racism, Nationalism and Biopolitics: Foucault’s Society Must Be Defended, 2003. Contretemps 4, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument to its logical end, it is only when there is never a need for the State to claim the right to kill or to let die that State racism will disappear.

Since killing is predicated on racism it follows that the "most murderous states are also the most racist" (p.&amp;nbsp;258).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Foucault refers to the way in which Nazism and the state socialism of the Soviet Union dealt with ethnic or social groups and their political adversaries as examples of this.

Threats, however, can change over time and here the utility of ‘race’ a concept comes into its own. While never defining ‘race’, Foucault suggests that the word ‘race’ is "not pinned to a stable biological meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; with the implication that it is a concept that is socially and historically constructed where a discourse of truth is enabled. This makes ‘race’ something that is easy for the State to adopt and exploit for its own purpose. ‘Race’ becomes a technology that is used by the state to structure threats and to make decisions over the life and death of sub-populations. In this way it helps to explain how the idea of ‘race’ or cultural difference are used to wage wars such as the "war on terror" or the "humanitarian war" in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, E.

== ''Security, Territory, Population'' (1977–1978)&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault  ''Lectures At The College de France Security, Territory, Population'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ==
{{Main article|Security, Territory, Population}}

The course deals with the genesis of a political knowledge that was to place at the centre of its concerns the notion of population and the mechanisms capable of ensuring its regulation but even of its procedures and means employed to ensure, in a given society, "the government of men". A transition from a "territorial state" to a "population state"([[Nation state]])?
Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] and [[biopower]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work at which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

Foucault's challenge to himself in these series of lectures is to try and decipher the genealogical split between power in ancient and [[Medieval]] society and late modern society, such as our own. By split Foucault means power as a force for manipulation of the human body. Previous notions of power failed to account for the historical subject and general shifts in techniques of power-according to Foucault's genealogy or genesis of power – it was totally denied that manipulation of the human body by unforeseen, outside forces ever existed. According to this theory, it was human ingenuity and man's ability to increase his own rationalisation was the primary motion behind social phenomena and the human subject and change was a result of increasing human reason and human conscience ingenuity. Foucault denies that any such notion had ever existed in the historical record and insists that this kind of thought is a misleading abstraction. Foucault cites the main driving force behind this set of accelerated change was the modern human sciences and the technologies both available to skilled professionals from the 16th century and a whole set of clever techniques used to shift the whole old social order into the new order of things. However, what was significant was the notion of [[Population]] practised upon the entire human species on a global mass scale, not in separately locally defined areas. By population, Foucault means its fluidness and malleability, Foucault refers to ‘a multiplicity of men, not to the extent that they are nothing more than individual bodies, but to the extent that they form, on the contrary, a global mass that is affected by overall processes of birth, death, production, taxation, illness and so forth, one should also take note that Foucault does not just mean population as singular event but a means of circulation tied to factors of security. What again was also significant was the idea of "freedom" the population's "freedom" which was the new modern [[Nation state]] and the 'neo-discourse' erected around such notions as freedom, work and [[Liberalism]], the ideological stance of the state (mass popular democracy and the voting franchise) and the state was only too willing to recognize and give freedom for example as the object of security. Population, in Foucault's understanding, is understood as a self-regulating mass;an agglomeration or circulation of people and things which co-operate and co-produce order free from heavy state regulation the state governs less allowing the population to "govern itself". For Foucault, the freedom of population is grasped at the level of how elements of population circulate. Techniques of security enact themselves through, and upon, the circulation which occurs at the level of population.In Foucault's opinion the modern concept of population, as opposed to the ancient [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and medieval version of "populousness" which has in its roots going as far back as the time period of the [[Book of Numbers]] in the [[Old testament]] [[Bible]] and the work that it sustained both in political theory and practice certainly does so; or, at least, the construction of the concept population is central to the creation of new orders of knowledge, new objects of intervention, new forms of subjectivity.

However, in order to fully understand what Foucault is trying to convey a few things should be said about the alteration techniques used that Foucault talks about in this series of lectures. The ancient and medieval version of [[Political power]] was centered around a central figure who was called a King, [[Emperor]], [[Prince]] or ruler (and in some cases the pope)of his principle territory whose rule was considered absolute ([[Absolute monarchy]]) by both [[Political philosophy]] and political theory of the day even in our time such notions still exist. Foucault uses the term population state to designate a new founded technology founded on the principal of security and territory which would mean a "population" to govern on a global mass with each population having its own territorial integrity(a separate nation) mapped out by experts in treaty negotiations&lt;ref&gt;''Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators'' Stuff 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating International Trade Treaties Before Exit'' Francis Hoar '' UK's Right to Negotiate Free Trade Agreements before leaving the European Union'' 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the new emerging field of 15th century [[Cartography|Advances in map-making technologies]] and the profession of [[Cartography]] eventually producing in the 18th century what we now know as [[nation states]]. These technologies take place at the level of "population" Foucault argues, and with the shifting aside of the body of the King or territorial ruler. By the time of the ending of the medieval period the body(or the persona of the king)of the territorial ruler became under increasingly under financial pressure and a cursory look at the medieval financial records tends to show that the monarch could not pay back all debts due to his creditors; the monarch would easily and readily default on loans due to any creditors causing financial ruin to creditors.Foucault notices that by the time of the 18th century several changes began to take place like the re-organization of armies, an emerging industrial working population begins to appear, (both military and industrial), the emergence of the [[Mathematical sciences]], [[Biological sciences]] and [[Physical sciences]] which, coincidently gave birth to a-what Foucault calls-Biopower and a political apparatus(machine) to take care of biological (in the form of medicine and health) and political life(mass democracy and the voting franchise for the population). An apparatus (both economic and political) was required much more sophisticated than previous social organisations of previous societies had at their disposal. For example, [[Bank]]s, which function as financial intermediaries and tied to the apparatus of the new 'state' machine which can easily pay back any large scale debts(large debts) which the King cannot, due to the king's own financial resources are limited;the king cannot pay back for example, the national debt, nor pay for a modern army out of his own personal resources, which can amount to trillions of US Dollars out of his own personal finances, that would be both impracticable and impossible.

== ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' (1978–1979) ==
{{Main article|The Birth of Biopolitics}}

''The Birth of Biopolitics'' develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] that Foucault introduced in his lectures on "Society must be defended". It traces how eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental rationality and raises questions of political philosophy and social policy about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics.

Over the course of many centuries the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour has received a great deal of attention. Recently(the last 60 years or so) in the academic field and journals there has been some development within the field of political and biological behaviour.In his College de France lecture course of January 1978 Foucault use the term Biopolitics(not for the first time) to denote politic power over every aspect of human life.Why did Foucault use the term Biopolitics in the first place?First of all the term Biopolitics has many different meanings to many different people and to fully understand the term as Foucault saw and used and understood it, we have to look at the very different meanings of the concept.For Foucault the term means to him the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour maximizing and increasing the human abilities machine(as we know the term).Over the course of evolutionary time this abilities machine of man becomes species specific, such as language capabilities, neuronal and cognitive capabilities so on and so forth.This then becomes over the course of the history of discursive technologies of scientific knowledge Foucault argues;became a field of knowledge established by groups of experts in the field of [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary Biology]], Physical sciences and Genetics for example.

The study of a new and rigorous discipline allied together with a new language(discourse technologies) in which a grasp of the new language is needed developing into a powerful force in the political realm as well as biological evolution the two become powerful allies (both biology and politics).Genetics and the change that develops(over time) over the course of the human organism existence.However, the two become co-joined unwittingly but one of them both political philosophy and political science have specific problems, both cannot have or lay claim to independent knowledge which is problematic for both lines of thought.Not in the case of ideology(as in Marxism) but in the case of discursive technologies.Foucault insists that the scientific knowledge being presented by historians is not an endeavour by the whole of humankind, particularly when written about by historians who claim that 'man' invented the sciences anymore than the Nazi represented the whole of humankind and the whole of humankind were to blame for the Nazi atrocities the ultimate embodiment of evil.But is, for all attempts and purposes a collaborative enterprise by groups of specially trained specialists producing a scientific community who have unfettered access to the whole of society through their scientific knowledge and expertise.

Change does indeed happen both within the organism and the organisms properties, the specific species is unable to correct them directly and biological change moves beyond any individual or single member of the species.However, these changes are aimed at the species as a whole and characteristics and traits are retained both at the biological, ecological and environmental level.In the human sciences (biology and genetics)these changes happen at a genetic and biological level which are unalterable and transpire from one generation to the next not at the individual level of the species.This is at the heart of the core theory of [[Charles Darwin]] and his proponents and the theory of [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]].Foucault's analysis try's to show that contrary to previous thought that the modern human sciences were somehow an obscure universal objective source which somehow had an absence of any linage, took over the role of the Christian church in disciplining the body by replacing the soul and confession of the Catholic church plus also the specific director of the process which in this case would be the deity(God), with indefinite supervision and discipline. However, these new techniques required a new 'director(s)' or 'editor(s)' who replaced the priestly and [[Pharaonic]] versions of much similar past vintages.These new governmental mechanism based upon the right of sovereignty and law both supported the fixed hierarchical organisation of the previous mode of feudal governmental mechanism, but stripping the modern human subject of any kind of self autonomy; not only fully fit for indoctrination, work, and education a fully fit conversant subject but left them vulnerable as well to face a permanent exam which he(the ordinary individual) had no chance in passing and was supposed to fail with no end point.Foucault maintains that these techniques were deliberate, cold, calculating and ruthless;the human sciences, far from being "a way at looking at the world" the knowledge/power dynamic/relationship [[Paradigm]] was a 'cheap' efficient and 'cost' effective method into a way of producing a subjugated and docile human subject(not only a citizen, but a political and productive citizen) as an instrument for administrative control and concern(through the state) for the well being of the population(and a constant help to the spread of Biopower)with the help of scientific classifications and new disciplinary technologies including the polity readily available to the human body and mind. Here are a few examples on what Foucault means by this type of "biopower" and bio-history of man

|[[Elizabeth Loftus]] is well known for her research in the area of memory.In this book she examines the way memories are encoded and the varies ways they can be altered.Forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the veracity of an eyewitness testimony.Loftus makes a strong argument against the eyewitness with a multitude of studies that have demonstrated the unreliability of their reports.New memories can be implanted and old memories altered with ease and this renders memories susceptible to tampering.The manner in which a question is posed can alter or implant a memory.The multiple choice style versus the open-ended style of questions are examples of this.The latter allows the witness to respond with "I don't know"whereas the former demands a response Loftus has found that people unknowingly convince themselves of an answer when forced to give an answer.With numerous real-life examples that address how we retain and retrieve memories to the differences in eyewitness ability, this book is vital to the understanding of [[Forensic psychology]].

"Yochelson and Samenow in this three volume series examine the criminal personality. The series starts at the first encounter with the offender and continues through to the process of change.It includes the issue of drug use in this population.The authors have detailed their research with what they termed "the criminal mind."Their definition of the criminal strongly resembles the description of antisocial-personality disorder and psychopathy.During the early stages of their research, Yochelson and Samenow limited their work to observation without the attempt of treatment.They detailed 52 features of criminal thinking that needed to be changed for rehabilitation to be a possibility.Patterns of deception are established early in this population and others rights are characteristically disregarded, and when arrested, this population tends to see themselves as victims and believe that they were good people despite their lengthy criminal records.Over time a treatment plan, or "process of change" was defined that change was most likely to occur in this population when the individual was vulnerable and desirous of change.The desire for change must be accompanied by an in depth knowledge of what needs to be changed.Finally, change is only possible when the long term benefits of change outweigh the benefits of maintaining a criminal lifestyle.Overall, change is considered a possibility, although not a common one.These three volumes comprise the most detailed, long-term examination of the criminal mind documented."

As with the most recent discovery of [[Mirror neurons]] has demonstrated Foucault has(while these techniques used in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Psychology]] are not mentioned alongside Foucault's name) hit on something that rigorous research methods may prove beyond a reasonable doubt that manipulation of social phenomena(which includes the human body and the mind) is most certainly possible.Techniques developed from the First and Second World war which started out as field experiments, among military personal, were then extended into ordinary civilian life; techniques borrowed from the Human cognitive sciences and found its way into [[Psychoanalysis|Psycho-analysis]], [[Psychiatry]], [[Psychology]], [[Clinical psychology]], [[Lightner Witmer]] and [[Clinical psychiatry]] (see this encyclopedia's article on [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]):"Mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer".He([[Ernest Dichter]]) "was the first to coin the term focus group and to stress the importance of image and persuasion in advertising".In [[Vance Packard]]'s book, [[The Hidden Persuaders]] Dichter's name is mentioned extensively.Subjectivation, a term Foucault coined for this purpose in which Biological life itself is given over to constant testing and research(an examination) without ever ending.One could argue;who are these new experts answerable too?Foucault argues that these new experts are answerable to absolutely no one.Just like previous notions of the past, absolute monarchy and divine rights of kings were answerable to nobody, their predecessors are just replacements of the past these new experts have now been democratised.Where mans body (and his soul)his mind can be manipulated and altered and is liable to be vulnerable. Every single aspect of the human subject is ripe for '[[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]]' and the technology-as it stands today-is unknown to us.This Biological ''allegory of man carries with it endless possibilities from the perspective of the [[Biological Sciences|Biological sciences]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]].The above extractions clearly show this “Biopower” of man requires man himself to administer these sophisticated technologies, where one group of experts or professionals(the enquiry) can completely subjugate another producing new human subjects(and new experts) through their expertise at manipulating social phenomena.In these few examples and according to this view:”the criminal is treated like a cancer” whereas human nature does not change which is the only society that ever gets produced, past,present or future.''

== ''On The Government Of The Living '' (1979–1980) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In the ''On The Government Of The Living'' lectures delivered in the early months of 1980, Foucault begins to ask questions of Western man obedience to power structures unreservedly and the pressing question of Government: "Government of children, government of souls and consciences, government of a household, of a state, or of oneself." Or [[governmentality]], as Foucault prefers to call it, although he fleshes out the development of that concept in his earlier lectures titled "Security, Territory, Population." Foucault tries to trace the kernel of "the genealogy of obedience" in western society. The 1980 lectures attempt to relate the historical foundations of "our obedience"—which must be understood as the obedience of the Western subject. Foucault argues confessional techniques are an innovation of the Christian West intended to guarantee men’s obedience to structures of power in return, so the belief goes, for Christian salvation.In his summary of the course Foucault asks the question: "How is it that within Western Christian culture, the government of men requires, on the part of those who are led, in addition to acts of obedience and submission, ‘acts of truth,’ which have this particular character that not only is the subject required to speak truthfully but to speak truthfully about himself?" The reader should take note here that much of this kind of work has been done before, albeit in what is best described as brilliant, lost and forgotten scholarship by such scholars as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] (his work on the [[body politic]] and the king's two bodies), [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], [[Carl Erdmann]], [[Hermann Kantorowicz]], [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederick Maitland]]. However, Foucault was after the genealogical dynamics and his main thrust was "regimes of truth" and the emergence and gradual development of "reflexive acts of truth". Foucault locates the very beginning of this act of obedience to power structures and the truth that they bring to the first Christian institutions between the 2nd century and the 5th century C.E. This is where Foucault starts to use his main tool—that is [[Genealogy (philosophy)|Genealogy]] as his main focus and it is with this genealogical tool that you finally get to understand fully what genealogy actually means. Foucault goes into great painstaking detail into the Christian [[baptism]] and its contingency and discontinuity in order to find "the genealogy of confession". This is an attempt-argues Foucault-to write a "political history of the truth".

== ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'' (1980–1981) ==
In these lectures, Foucault develops notions on the ability of the concept of truth to shift through time as described by the modern human sciences (for example [[Ethology]]) in contrast to ancient society (Aristotelian notions). It discusses how these notions are accepted as truth and produce the self as true. This is followed by a discussion on the existence of this truth and the discourse of truth for the experience of the self.

The '''Ginger Group''' was not a formal political party in [[Canada]], but a [[Political factions|faction]] of radical [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] and [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] who advocated [[socialism]]. The term [[ginger group]] also refers to a small group with new, radical ideas trying to act as a catalyst within a larger body.

The Ginger Group split with the Progressive Party in 1924 when Progressive leader [[Robert Forke]] proved too eager to accommodate the Liberal government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and agreed to support the government's budget with only minimal concessions. [[J. S. Woodsworth]], using his right as the leader of the Independent Labour MPs, moved a stronger amendment to the budget based on demands the Progressives had made in earlier years but had since abandoned. The Progressive and Labour MPs who broke with their Progressive colleagues to support Woodsworth became the "Ginger Group".&lt;ref name=irvine&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMLs5Gbq5wC&amp;pg=PA133 |title=William Irvine: the Life of a Prairie Radical |first=Anthony |last=Mardiros |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co |location=Tonornto |date=1979 |pages=132-140 |isbn=978-0-8886-2237-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=agnes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nlnmjRt71oC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Agnes Macphail and the Politics of Equality |first=Terence Allan |last=Crowley |page=75-77 |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co |location=Tonornto |date=1990 |isbn=978-1-5502-8326-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made up of [[United Farmers of Alberta]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s [[George Gibson Coote]], [[Robert Gardiner (Canadian politician)|Robert Gardiner]], [[Edward Joseph Garland]], [[Donald MacBeth Kennedy]] and [[Henry Elvins Spencer]] as well as [[United Farmers of Ontario]] MP [[Agnes Macphail]]. The group was later joined by [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] MPs J. S.

Members of the Ginger Group played a role in forming the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] in 1932, with Woodsworth becoming the new party's leader.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;

The only sitting United Farmers of Alberta who did not join the CCF at its founding was [[William Thomas Lucas]] who ran for re-election unsuccessfully as a Conservative in 1935.

The name Ginger Group was also used to refer to a group of [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] MPs who, in 1917 opposed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]]'s use of the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] to introduce [[conscription]] during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].&lt;ref name=agnes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

'''Gyorin''' (lit. "neighborly relations") was a [[neo-Confucian]] term developed in [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] [[Korea]].  The term was intended to identify and characterize a diplomatic policy which establishes and maintains amicable relations with neighboring states.  It was construed and understood in tandem with a corollary term, which was the ''[[Sadaejuui|sadae]]'' or "serving the great" policy towards [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]].&lt;ref&gt;Yim Min-Hyeok.

The long-term, strategic ''gyorin'' policy played out in [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] diplomacy and trade dealings with [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], Japan, Ryūkyū Kingdom, Siam and others.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WBZjBPt1H8AC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=  pp. 76-77;] [http://www.raskb.com/ Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch] (RASKB): [http://www.raskb.com/zboard/view.php?id=raslecture&amp;page=1&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=127  [[Yi Sugwang]] with Vietnamese counterpart [[Phùng Khắc Khoan]] in 1597.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, diplomatic and trade policies were perceived by Joseon's partners as the traditional door through which trends in neo-Confucian philosophical principles were recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Steben, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joseon kingdom made every effort to maintain a friendly bilateral relationship with China for reasons having to do with both ''[[realpolitik]]'' and a more idealist Confucian worldview wherein China was seen as the center of a Confucian moral universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mansourov, Alexandre Y. [http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/174/43/ "Will Flowers Bloom without Fragrance? Korean-Chinese Relations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108074830/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/174/43/ |date=2008-01-08 }} ''Harvard Asia Quarterly'' (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseon diplomacy was no less aware and sensitive to ''realpolitik'' in the implementation of ''gyorin'' policy.

The unique nature of ''gyorin'' bilateral diplomatic exchanges evolved from a conceptual framework developed by the Chinese.  Gradually, the theoretical models would be modified, mirroring the evolution of a unique relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Toby, Ronald P. (1991).

'''Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party''' (Democratic Majority Society Party), splinter group of [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP) formed in 1997 when 19 BSP Members of the Legislative Assembly of [[Uttar Pradesh]] broke away. JBSP allied themselves with [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and joined the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]]. In UP they gave their support to [[Kalyan Singh]]'s government. 17 out of the JBSP MLAs were inducted as ministers in the state government. The president of JBSP was DP Yadav ([[Rajya Sabha]] MP) and the general secretary Shahidullah Khan.

JBSP became an unstable party, and suffered various splits. Four MLAs defected to [[Lok Jan Shakti Party]]. Another splinter group was [[Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party]].

When JBSP fell apart DP Yadav organized a new party, [[Rashtriya Parivartan Dal]].

JBSP should not be confused with another BSP splinter group, [[Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party]].

[[File:Kaliningrad Oblast within Europe.svg|thumb|right|Location of [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]]]
The '''Kaliningrad question''' is a [[political]] question concerning the status of [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] as an [[exclave]] of Russia,&lt;ref name="sebentsov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Yann|last2=Sebentsov|first2=Alexander|last3=Zotova|first3=Maria|title=The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

In Western media, the region is most often discussed in relation to the deployment of missile systems, initially as a response to the deployment of missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="harding"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Russia threatening new cold war over missile defence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/11/usa.topstories3|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=the Guardian|date=11 April 2007|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704131554/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/11/usa.topstories3|archivedate=4 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia views the region as a vital element of its ability to project power in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="michta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michta|first1=Andrew A.|title=Kaliningrad and the Escalatory Spiral in the Baltics|url=http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/66402|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Carnegie Europe|date=9 December 2016|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130054710/http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/66402|archivedate=30 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fringe position also considers the return of the province to [[Germany]] from the [[Russian Federation]], or its independence from both. The former question is mostly hypothetical, as the current [[German government]] has stated that it has no claim to it.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=125}}&lt;ref name="moscow"&gt;Tétrault-Farber, Gabrielle.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-093-65, Flüchtlinge auf Schiff.jpg|thumbnail|[[Refugees from Königsberg]] fleeing to western Germany before the advancing Red Army in 1945]]
Kaliningrad, or [[Königsberg]], had been a part of a German state (the [[Teutonic Order]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Imperial Germany|unified Germany]]) for several centuries before the [[Second World War]], and the city was historically a rich German cultural center, being the home of – among others – the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. 

The annexation of the Königsberg area of [[East Prussia]] to Russia became a stated war aim of the Soviet Union at [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Michael|last2=Coppieters|first2=Bruno|last3=Malashenko|first3=Alekseĭ Vsevolodovich|title=Conflicting Loyalties and the State in Post-Soviet Russia and Eurasia|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714648828|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503193910/https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|archivedate=2018-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the city was captured by the [[Soviet Union]]. As agreed by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]], northern Prussia, including Königsberg, was annexed by the USSR, which attached it to the [[Russian SFSR]]. In 1946, the city's name was changed to [[Kaliningrad]].

In October 1945, only about 5,000 Soviet civilians lived in the territory.&lt;ref name="malinkin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malinkin|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Building a Soviet City: the Transformation of Königsberg|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=2 May 2018|date=8 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707061350/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1947 and October 1948, about 100,000 [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-50)|Germans were forcibly moved]] to Germany.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|title=How to be Russian with a Difference? Kaliningrad and its German Past|journal=Geopolitics|date=13 May 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=345–366|doi=10.1080/14650040903486967}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400,000 Soviet civilians arrived by 1948.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Some moved voluntarily, but as the number of willing settlers proved insufficient, [[collective farms]] were given quotas of how many people they had to send to Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Often they sent the least socially desirable individuals, such as alcoholics and the uneducated.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] suggested that the [[Lithuanian SSR]] should annex Kaliningrad Oblast. The offer was refused by the [[Lithuanian Communist Party]] leader [[Antanas Sniečkus]], who did not wish to alter the ethnic composition of his republic.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=39}} In the late Soviet era, rumors spread that the Oblast might be converted into a homeland for [[Soviet Germans]].&lt;ref name="diener10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Hagen|first2=Joshua|title=Borderlines and Borderlands: Political Oddities at the Edge of the Nation-State|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742568440|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pci-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaliningrad Oblast remained part of the Soviet Union until [[USSR dissolution|its dissolution]] in 1991, and since then has been an [[exclave]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. After the Soviet collapse, some descendants of the expellees and refugees traveled to the city to examine their roots.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; According to the 2010 Russian Census, 7,349 ethnic Germans live in the Oblast, making up 0.8% of the population.&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the status of Kaliningrad and the rights of expellees was a mainstream political issue until the 1960s, when the shifting political discourse increasingly associated similar views with right-wing revisionism.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"/&gt;

According to a ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article published in 2010, in 1990 the West German government received a message from the Soviet general Geli Batenin, offering to return Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="ballast"/&gt; The offer was never seriously considered by the Bonn government, who saw [[German reunification|reunification]] with the East as its priority.&lt;ref name="ballast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiegrefe|first1=Klaus|title=ZEITGESCHICHTE: Historischer Ballast|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014130823/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the EU was alleged to be in talks with Russia to arrange an [[EU association|association]] agreement with the Kaliningrad Oblast, at a time when Russia could not repay £22 billion debt owed to Berlin, which may have given Germany some influence over the territory.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html "Germany in secret talks with Russia to take back Konigsberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206041607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html |date=2018-02-06 }}." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. January 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of "buying back" Kaliningrad or other "secret deals" were repudiated by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|last=Wagner|first=Rudolf|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|date=22 January 2001|accessdate=2018-03-21|title=Königsberg für eine Hand voll Euro?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010948/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rumor about a debt-related deal, published by the Russian weekly ''Nash Continent'', alleged that Putin and [[Edmund Stoiber]] had agreed on the gradual return of Kaliningrad in return for waiving the country's $50 billion debt to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karabeshkin|first1=Leonid|last2=Wellmann|first2=Christian|title=The Russian Domestic Debate on Kaliningrad: Integrity, Identity and Economy|date=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783825879525|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501085510/https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for irredentism==
[[Inesis Feldmanis]], head of the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the [[University of Latvia]], has been quoted saying that the [[Soviet Union]]'s annexation of Kaliningrad is "an error in history".&lt;ref name="moscow"/&gt;

The [[Freistaat Preußen]] Movement, one of the most active offshoots of the [[Reichsbürger]] movement, considers the Russian (and German) government as illegitimate and see themselves as the rightful rulers of the region.&lt;ref name="rhz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reichsbürger: Wie eine „Ministerpräsidentin“ aus der Eifel die Bundesrepublik bekämpft und einen Weltkrieg riskieren will|url=https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Rhein-Zeitung|date=16 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325191444/https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the movement is split into two competing factions, one based in [[Königsfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate]] and the other in Bonn.&lt;ref name="rhz"/&gt;

===In Lithuania===
{{seealso|Lithuania Minor}}
Some political groups in [[Lithuania]] claim the parts of Kaliningrad Oblast between the [[Pregolya River|Pregel]] and [[Nemunas river|Nemunas]] Rivers, but they have little influence.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}} [[Linas Balsys (politician)|Linas Balsys]], a deputy in the Lithuanian parliament, has argued that the status of the exclave should be discussed at international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts comment on Lithuanian MP’s claims regarding Russia's Kaliningrad|url=http://tass.com/politics/927891|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=TASS|date=30 January 2017|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317113724/http://tass.com/politics/927891|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the former Lithuanian president [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] called for the separation and '[[decolonization]]' of Kaliningrad from Russia.&lt;ref name="kempton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempton|first1=Daniel R.|last2=Clark|first2=Terry D.|title=Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275973063|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095203/https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, the Lithuanian parliament speaker [[Romualdas Ozolas]] expressed his view that Kaliningrad should become an independent republic.&lt;ref name="vitunic"/&gt;

After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the political analyst [[Laurynas Kasčiūnas]] called for a revisiting of the Potsdam Agreement.&lt;ref name="lrt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ar Karaliaučiaus statusas turėtų būti peržiūrimas?|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/pasaulyje/3/65279/ar-karaliauciaus-statusas-turetu-buti-perziurimas|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Lietuvos Radijas ir Televizija|language=lt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095205/https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/pasaulyje/3/65279/ar-karaliauciaus-statusas-turetu-buti-perziurimas|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that residents of Kaliningrad would support a referendum to separate from Russia.&lt;ref name="lrt"/&gt; The notion of a Lithuanian claim has been brushed off by Russian media, with the liberal ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' newspaper dismissing it as a 'geopolitical fantasy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=С легкой претензией на Калининград|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2014/09/26/61321-s-legkoy-pretenziey-na-kaliningrad|accessdate=4 May 2018|work=Новая газета|date=26 September 2014|language=ru-RU|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504195035/https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2014/09/26/61321-s-legkoy-pretenziey-na-kaliningrad|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland has made no claim to Kaliningrad, and is seen as being unlikely to do so, as it was a net beneficiary of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], which also decided the status of Kaliningrad.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">[[File:83 Portrait of Frederick the Wise.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], who protected [[Martin Luther]], was a "lesser magistrate" under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].]]
The doctrine of the '''lesser magistrate''' is a concept in [[Protestant]] thought. A lesser magistrate is a ruler such as a prince who is under a greater ruler such as an emperor. According to many figures of the Reformation and Post-Reformation eras, the lesser magistrate has the authority to rebel against the tyranny of a supreme ruler.

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate finds its origin in [[John Calvin]], who wrote that whereas private Christians must submit to the ruling authorities, there are "popular magistrates" who have "been appointed to curb the tyranny of kings". When these magistrates "connive at kings when they tyrannise and insult over the humbler of the people" they "fraudulently betray the liberty of the people" when God has appointed them guardians of that liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Calvin]], ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xxi.html IV.xx.31].&lt;/ref&gt;

The lesser magistrate is prominent in the [[Lutheran]] ''[[Magdeburg Confession]]'' of 1550, which argued that the "subordinate powers" in a state, faced with the situation where the "supreme power" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wernham|first1=R. B.|title=Counter-Reformation and Price Revolution, 1559-1610|date=1968|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate became important for the justification of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. According to [[Johannes Althusius]] in 1603 work, ''Politica'', resistance to a supreme magistrate by lesser magistrates is justified in the case of tyranny. Althusius argued that the provincial authorities of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were in this situation.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Friedeburg, "Althusius," in ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Dutch Philosophers'', ed. W. van Bunge (Bristol, 2003), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary M. Simpson suggests that after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572 there was a "populist expansion" of the doctrine in which "the ruled would no longer be merely the subject of the ruler; they would become citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Simpson, "Toward a Lutheran "Delight in the Law of the Lord": Church and State in the Context of Civil Society," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn6CgUOOriUC&amp;pg=PA43 Church &amp; State: Lutheran Perspectives]'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wen Ho Lee ==
[[Wen Ho Lee]] is a Taiwanese-American scientist who worked for the University of California at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He created simulations of nuclear explosions for the purpose of scientific inquiry and to improve the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In December 1999, a federal grand jury indicted him of stealing secrets about the arsenal for China.

After federal investigators could not prove the initial accusations, the government conducted a separate investigation. It could only charge Lee with improper handling of restricted data, part of the original 59-count indictment to which he pleaded guilty as part of a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]]. In June 2006, Lee received $1.6&amp;nbsp;million from the federal government and five media organizations as partial settlement of a civil suit he filed against them for leaking his name to the press before charges were filed against him. At the conclusion of the case, Presiding federal judge James A. Parker stated that he was misled "by the executive branch of our government through its Department of Justice, by its Federal Bureau of Investigation and by its United States attorney". The judge stated that while he couldn't speak on behalf of the executive branch "I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner you were held in custody by the executive branch." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/14/us/statement-by-judge-in-los-alamos-case-with-apology-for-abuse-of-power.html/ |title= Statement by Judge in Los Alamos Case, With Apology for Abuse of Power|publisher=The New York Times |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fei Ye and Ming Zhong==
Fei Ye, a U.S. citizen; and Ming Zhong, a permanent resident of the United States; were arrested at the San Francisco International Airport on November 23, 2001. They were accused of stealing trade secrets in designing a computer microprocessor to benefit China, although prosecutors did not allege that the Chinese government knew of their activities. In December 2002, they were charged with a total of ten counts, including conspiracy; economic espionage; possession of stolen trade secrets; and foreign transportation of stolen property. In 2006 (five years after their arrest), they pleaded guilty to two counts each of economic espionage. In 2008, they were sentenced to a year in prison. The maximum sentence is 30 years however prosecutors asked for less because of their cooperation. The case resulted in the first convictions under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |title=Two Men Plead Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets from Silicon Valley Companies to Benefit China |publisher=justice.gov |date=2016-12-14 |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415113905/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cnet.com/news/2-engineers-sentenced-for-espionage/ |title= 2 engineers sentenced for espionage|publisher=cnet.com |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While prosecutors promised the jurors a "treasure trove" of evidence against the "traitors" and "spies", the defense stated the two just wanted to start their own company with their own ideas.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/10/21/san-jose-jury-hears-conflicting-stories-in-opening-of-espionage-trial/ |title= San Jose jury hears conflicting stories in opening of espionage trial|publisher=mercurynews.com |date=2009-10-21|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After a month long trial, a federal jury acquitted the two defendants on two counts and were leaning towards acquitting the two by a vote of 9:3 on two most serious counts of economic espionage. Jurors said the U.S. government failed to prove the NetLogic data was even a trade secret and much less aimed to benefit China. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/11/20/federal-jury-deadlocks-on-most-of-espionage-case-against-two-silicon-valley-engineers/ |title= Federal jury deadlocks on most of espionage case against two Silicon Valley engineers|publisher=mercurynews.com |date=2009-11-20|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86261">This is a '''list of regimes of countries''' or individual leaders around the world which have been discussed in the media or academia as having created a [[cult of personality]]. A  cult of personality uses various techniques, including [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], [[the arts]], [[patriotism]], and government-organized demonstrations and rallies to create an heroic image, of a leader, often inviting worshipful behavior through uncritical flattery and praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrian Teodor|last=Popan|title=The ABC of sycophancy : structural conditions for the emergence of dictators' cults of personality |date=August 2015 |doi=10.15781/T2J960G15 |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en |id=|hdl=2152/46763|pages=196–213|website=The University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] of the ruling [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|communist party]] served as [[President of Afghanistan]] from 1978 to 1979, when he told people to refer to him titles such as the "Great Leader".&lt;ref&gt;''Russia's Muslim Frontiers. New Directions in Cross-Cultural Analysis'' by Dale F. Eickelman, 1993. Page 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, warlord general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who controlled most of northern Afghanistan, created a somewhat cult of personality in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rashid-dostum-the-treacherous-general-9224857.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania==
Long time ruler of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist Albania]] [[Enver Hoxha]] had what the [[OECD]] called "an overwhelming cult of personality and an ultra-centralised, authoritarian form of decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reviews of National Policies for Education:South Eastern Europe|author=[[OECD]]|year=2003|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9789264100725|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1jWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoxha was widely portrayed as a genius who commented on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Statues were erected in cities. Each schoolbook required quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The ruling party of the time, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  When Hoxha died in 1985, [[Ramiz Alia]] took power. [[Robert D. McFadden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Alia's policies of liberalization were "too little, too late", and the country descended into [[Albanian Civil War|violent anarchy]]. Alia served one year in prison for corruption, but the anarchy prevented further charges from being brought against the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/europe/ramiz-alia-former-ruler-of-albania-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Ramiz Alia, an Enforcer for a Dictator and Later Ruler of Albania, Dies at 85|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==
{{See also|Peronism}}

[[Juan Domingo Perón]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]], and his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón]], were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the leading [[Justicialist Party]]. Followers of the Peróns praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and dignify labor, while their detractors considered them [[demagogue]]s and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Education in Argentina'', 1946-1962, by Mónica Esti Rein; trans by Martha Grenzeback.

==Brazil==
During the [[Vargas Era]], the Brazilian Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP) promoted a [[Messiah]]-style image of Brazilian dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] by broadcasting propaganda every day and by showing him as "saviour of the Brazilian people".

In recent years there has been a growing cult of personality in modern Brazil around the former Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], promoted by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] and more recently, around [[Jair Bolsonaro]], promoted by right-wing militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/reinaldo/culto-a-personalidade-politicos-pagam-r-20-para-ter-fotomontagem-com-lula/|title=Culto à personalidade: políticos pagam R$ 20 para ter fotomontagem com Lula {{!}} Reinaldo Azevedo {{!}} VEJA.com|work=VEJA.com|access-date=2017-11-20|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
[[File:Chiang KaiShek Portrait Tiananmen Beijing.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Portrait of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on [[Tiananmen]] before the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist takeover]]]]
A personality cult in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was centered on the [[Kuomintang]] party founder [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his successor, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The personality cult of Chiang Kai-shek went further after the republican government fled to [[Taiwan]]. He was usually referred to as "Lord Chiang" (蔣公) in public and a [[Tai tou|space between the characters of his name and title]] was required in printed materials. Articles in textbooks and songs glorifying him were commonly seen in Taiwan before 1987.
[[File:Mao Zedong Statue in North China.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Statue of [[Mao Zedong]] in modern [[China]]]]
The [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] can also be considered a cult of personality,{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} the most obvious symbol of which is his massive portrait situated on the north end of [[Tiananmen Square]]. The [[culture of the People's Republic of China]] before 1978 was highly influenced by the personality cult of Mao Zedong{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} which reached its peak during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Mao was referred to as "the great leader Chairman Mao" (伟大领袖毛主席) in public and he was entitled "the great leader, the great supreme commander, the great teacher and the great helmsman" (伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的导师、伟大的舵手) in Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5QbQpQTegwC&amp;pg=PA421|title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China |year=1995|location=|page=639|accessdate=2012-08-01|isbn=9789622016156|author1=Li|first1=Gucheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges and books of his quotations were mass-produced. Most people were required to recite the Quotations of Chairman Mao and printed material at that time usually quoted Mao's words in bold as well as in the preface. The Loyalty dance (忠字舞) was also introduced during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976.

The cult of personality continued for a short time after Mao's death. His successor, Chairman [[Hua Guofeng]] also practiced the cult of personality{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and he was referred to as "the brilliant leader Chairman Hua" (英明领袖华主席). [[Chinese economic reform|Reforms]] in 1978 led to a deconstruction of Mao's cult status and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and his successors such as [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]] were averse to a [[:zh:毛澤東崇拜|Mao cult]] of personality style of rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

The rise and consolidation of power under [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] has given way to a return to Mao-style personality cult centered around General Secretary Xi in [[Media of China|state media]] and [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]] messages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21618882-cult-personality-growing-around-chinas-president-what-will-he-do-his-political|title=The power of Xi Jinping.

==Colombia==
Former president [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] became the center of a Cult of Personality in [[Colombia]] in the later years of the country's armed conflict. Supporters refer to him as "The Great Colombian" in spite of his family's ties to the [[Medellín Cartel]] and the numerous human rights scandals that marred his presidency. After Uribe failed to amend the constitution that would allow him to stay in power for a third term in 2010, he founded a political party that uses the former president's silhouette as logo. The party's attempts to be named after its "only leader" were thwarted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/opinion/articulo/fanatismo-por-alvaro-uribe/524937|title=La deificación del senador Uribe|work=Semana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
Although it was reported that one of [[Fidel Castro]]'s dying wishes was not to have buildings or streets named after him, and that statues of him not be erected, in order to avoid a cult of personality, it is generally believed{{cn|date=October 2018}} that such a cult had already developed by the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bamat, Joseph (December 5, 2018) [http://www.france24.com/en/20161205-cuba-fidel-castro-cult-personality-last-battle "Is Castro's battle to avoid a personality cult destined to fail?"] ''[[France 24]]''.

In Africa he is seen as a key player in the continent's anti-colonial and anti-apartheid movements.

==Equatorial Guinea==
The first president of [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], was the centre of an extreme personality cult, perhaps fueled by his consumption of copious amounts of ''[[bhang]]''&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator|publisher=Afroarticles.com|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104035212/http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[iboga]]'',&lt;ref name=Pariah&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pariah President: Teodoro Obiang is a brutal dictator responsible for thousands of deaths.

The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanized after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to [[Bioko]]. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to [[Malabo]]. In 1978, he changed the [[national motto]] of the [[Coat of arms of Equatorial Guinea]] to "There is no other God than Marcias Nguema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator |publisher=Afroarticles.com |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313200255/http://afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has been continued by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] who has been accused of building his own personality cult. As evidence of this, in July 2003, the state-operated radio declared that Obiang was "the country's [[God (word)|god]]" and that he had "all power over men and things."  It added that the president was "in permanent contact with the Almighty" and that he "can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to [[hell]]."  He personally made similar comments in 1993. Macías had also proclaimed himself a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Equatorial Guinea's 'God' |accessdate=1 November 2007 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3098007.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obiang has encouraged his cult of personality by ensuring that public speeches end with well-wishing for himself rather than end with well-wishing for the republic. Many important buildings have a presidential lodge, many towns and cities have streets commemorating Obiang's coup against Macías, and many people wear clothes with his face printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;Maass, Peter (2005) [http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/01/obiang-equatorial-guinea-oil-riggs "A Touch of Crude"] ''Mother Jones'' 30 (1):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;48–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverstein"&gt;Silverstein, Ken (2010) [http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm "Saturday Lagniappe: UNESCO for Sale: Dictators allowed to buy their own prizes, for the right price"] ''Petroleumworld'', originally published by ''Harpers Magazine'', 2 June 2010, archived at [http://www.freezepage.com/1287676231QTNSPIRBQH?url=http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm Freezepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==
During the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy era]], there was a personality cult around [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]]. He was made [[president for life]] by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPRS]] in 1963. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station ([[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]], government-run), and the only television station ([[TVRI]], also government-run) were made into "tools of the revolution" and functioned to spread Sukarno's messages. Sukarno developed a [[personality cult]], with the capital of newly acquired [[Western New Guinea|West Irian]] renamed to [[Jayapura|Sukarnapura]] and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to [[Puncak Jaya|Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak)]].

Sukarno was popularly referred to as ''bung'' ("comrade"), and he painted himself as a man of the people who carried the aspirations of Indonesia and dared to take on the West.&lt;ref name="Witton_28"&gt;{{harvp|Witton|2003|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some other titles were given to him, like "Great Leader of the Revolution".  When [[Suharto]] became president, Sukarno's cult and roles were erased by the new government in [[de-Soekarnoization]] policy.

The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government created some propaganda, in which President Suharto is depicted as the "main hero" during the [[General Offensive of 1 March 1949|1949 General Offensive]], as well as during the [[30 September Movement]]. He was also granted the title of ''Bapak Pembangunan'' (Father of Development) in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Rock (2003), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, four months after the [[fall of Suharto]], Information Minister [[Yunus Yosfiah]] declared that the ''[[Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI]]'' film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto as the protagonist.

As a sign of his consolidation of power as [[Iraq]]'s dictator, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s personality cult pervaded Iraqi society.

Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even appeared in [[Kurdish clothing]], but he also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout [[Muslim]], wearing a full headdress and robe, praying towards [[Mecca]], but most often he was depicted wearing a military uniform.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Göttke, F. ''Toppled'', Rotterdam: Post Editions, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An international airport, a university, a bridge, a dam, a stadium, an art centre, a street, an urban district (Saddam-city), a rocket and other objects were named after him. Saddam even had many well-decorated (by golden flush toilets) palaces for his own private use. People brought many gifts to Saddam that were collected in a special palace. According to his order, every tenth brick of reconstructed ancient buildings (including [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s palace) was marked with his name or signature.

[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|160px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in a poster promoted by fascist [[propaganda]] with the motto: "Win and we shall win"]]
The cult of [[Il Duce]] of fascist Italy [[Benito Mussolini]] was in many respects the unifying force of the fascist regime, acting as a common denominator for various political groups and social classes in both the fascist party and the wider Italian society. A basic slogan proclaimed that Mussolini was always right ({{lang-it|Il Duce ha sempre ragione}}). Endless publicity revolved around him. He was generally portrayed in a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' manner, although he could also appear as a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], a military man, a family man, or even as a [[Commoner|common man]]. This reflected his presentation as a universal man, expert in all subjects; a light was left on his office long after he was asleep as a part of fascist propaganda in order to present him as an [[insomnia]]c owing to his driven to work nature. Mussolini himself oversaw which photographs could appear, rejecting some, for instance, because he was not sufficiently prominent in a group. Legends of Mussolini defying death during the [[First World War]] and surviving assassination attempts were circulated in order to give the dictator a mythical, immortal aura. In addition to depicting Mussolini as being chosen by God, the regime presented him as having omnipotent, godlike or superhuman powers. His image proclaimed that he had improved the Italian people morally, materially, and spiritually. Even before his seizure of power, he was proclaimed the Duce in song. The [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|war on Ethiopia]] was presented as a revival of the [[Roman Empire]], with Mussolini as [[Augustus]].

With the entry of media [[tycoon]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] into [[Italian politics]] in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], some critics claimed that a new kind of cult of personality was in place, favored by Berlusconi's three national television networks and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/silvio-canzoni/silvio-canzoni.html|title="Silvio forever sarà, Silvio è genialità" il culto della personalità diventa canzone - Politica - Repubblica.it|work=repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the hymn of Berlusconi's movements [[Forza Italia]] and [[People of Freedom]] was ''Meno male che Silvio c'è'', literally "Thank goodness for Silvio".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|WXf-YbsSh0Y|Meno male che Silvio c'è video ufficiale inno campagna PDL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100passijournal.info/20-anni-fa-la-discesa-in-campo/|title=Berlusconi: vent'anni fa la "discesa in campo"|work=100 passi journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, Berlusconi often described himself as the [[Jesus Christ]] of Italian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4707368.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Berlusconi says 'I am like Jesus'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874126,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes | date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes were seen by public opinion as clear examples of the new political style that Berlusconi brought into [[Italy]], focused on the leader's [[charisma]], cult of personality and media domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.giovani.it/politica/118744-culto-personalita-italia.html|title=Giovani.it|work=giovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio Berlusconi was [[Prime Minister of Italy]] for three terms and four governments. He governed the country for a total of almost ten years (less than one year in 1994–1995; five years in 2001–2006; and three and a half years in 2008–2011).

==Laos==
A cult of personality is centered around the founders of the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] and the less prominent [[Prince Souphanouvong]] since their deaths in the early 1990s as there were no personality cults bestowed to them during their time in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/world/laos-capital-defies-time-and-change.html|title=Laos Capital Defies Time And Change|last=Kamm|first=Henry|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1995-08-06|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysone's portrait is displayed on public government buildings as well as on [[Laotian Kip]] bills. There is a museum built in [[Vientiane]] in order to honor Kaysone's life. Statues are also erected in his honor. [[Souphanouvong]]'s name and face are also seen in memorials, museums, and statues all across Laos, with a university being named after him in [[Luang Prabang]]. Due to Souphanouvong's past position as only a figurehead president and leader of the communist [[Pathet Lao]] movement with Kaysone holding the real power over Laos, the display of Souphanouvong's personality cult are seen with much lesser prominence than Kaysone.

In the [[Philippines]], many local politicians engage in some sort of cult of personality. The most famous are those of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was dictator from 1972 to 1986 and the [[Aquino family]]. They are often branded as "epalitiko" by the media, which is a contraction of the words ''epal'' (slang for "attention-grabber"), and ''pulítiko'' ("politician").

==Poland==
{{Main article|Józef Piłsudski's cult of personality}}
A cult of personality developed in [[Poland]] around the figure of [[Józef Piłsudski]], a Polish military commander and politician, starting from the [[interwar period]] and continuing after his death in 1935 until the present day. During the interwar period, Piłsudski's personality cult was propagated by the state media, which described him as a masterful strategist and a political visionary, and associated him with his role in regaining Polish independence in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and his leadership in the ensuing [[Polish–Soviet War]]. It has survived decades of repression, particularly during the era of [[People's Republic of Poland|communist rule]].

In modern Poland, Piłsudski is recognized as an important and largely positive figure in [[History of Poland|Polish history]]. [[Polish Independence Day]] is commemorated on November 11, the date when Piłsudski assumed power in Poland after the First World War.
The [[Law and Justice]] party builds the cult of the deceased  president [[Lech Kaczyński]]

[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena in 1986]]
In 1986 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter, [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] stated that [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] presided over "a cult of personality that has equaled, or even surpassed, those of [[Stalin's Russia]], [[Mao's China]] and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/the-cult-of-ceausescu.html|title=The Cult of Ceausescu|last=Binder|first=David|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 1986|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung in North Korea, it started with the 1971 [[July Theses]] which reversed the liberalization of the 1960s and imposed a strict nationalist ideology. Initially, the cult of personality was only focused on Ceaușescu himself; however, by the early 1980s, his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]] was also a focus of the cult even to the extent that she got credit for scientific achievements which she could never have accomplished. It remained in force until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|overthrow of the regime in 1989]] and the couple's execution.

{{quote|Comrades, the cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods, supported the glorification of his own person.... One of the most characteristic examples of Stalin's self-glorification and of his lack of even elementary modesty is the edition of his Short Biography, which was published in 1948.

This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming him into an infallible sage, "the greatest leader", "sublime strategist of all times and nations". Finally no other words could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens.

We need not give here examples of the loathsome adulation filling this book. All we need to add is that they all were approved and edited by Stalin personally and some of them were added in his own handwriting to the draft text of the book.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | title = The Cult of the Individual | url = https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches2 | accessdate = 2012-09-02 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nikita | last=Khrushchev | date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors (e.g., [[Alexander Zinovyev]]) have argued that [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev's cult of personality was his obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. http://oldgazette.ru/kopravda/21021978/01-1.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many [[Russian political jokes#Brezhnev|political jokes]].

Some journalists and Russian oppositionists argue that there is now a cult of personality around [[Vladimir Putin]] (see also [[Putinism]]). Currently, one-fourth of the Russian population believes that a cult of personality reminiscent of Soviet Union-era leaders has developed around Vladimir Putin, while another thirty percent believed that there were increasing signs of a personality cult surrounding Putin.

A cult of personality surrounded [[Francisco Franco]] during his [[Francoist Spain|Falangist regime]]. During his regime, he was depicted like a [[King of Spain|king]], for example, he wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the king), resided in the royal [[Pardo Palace]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' ([[Generalissimo]] of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,'' ([[By the Grace of God]], the Leader of Spain). ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and it had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself.

A number of scholarly papers and peer-reviewed articles have assessed the personality cult that some claim has developed around U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. One is in a paper that appeared in the 2016 [[American Political Science Association]] Annual Meeting. In the paper, Sarah Oates, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]], and Wendy W. Moe, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]], discussed the subject broadly and then stated that "during the 2016 Presidential primaries, the 'cult of personality' candidate, Trump, won the primary."&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2830195 ''Donald Trump and the 'Oxygen of Publicity': Branding, Social Media, and Mass Media in the 2016 Presidential Primary Elections.''] Sarah Oates and Wendy W. Moe. [[American Political Science Association]]. 25 August 2016. p.21. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is in a book by [[University of Dayton]] distinguished professor of history [[Larry Schweikart]] and political commentator and author [[Joel Pollak]]. In their book, ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution'', they state that "some conservatives looked forward to Trump's defeat as a chance to rid the GOP of the insufficiently conservative insurgents who were bringing it to defeat by choosing a candidate who was a mere reality-show Hollywood celebrity, a lifetime liberal who was hijacking their party and their cause with a vain cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PWvYDQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT6 ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution.''] [[Joel Pollak]] and [[Larry Schweikart]]. Regnery Publishing. 2017. p.6. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A third was written by [[Ethnology|ethnologist]]s Jonathan Rosa and Yarimar Bonilla who wrote, "although we do not minimize the devastating impact that [Trump] administration's policies will have, or the new president's ominous behavior, we are wary of exceptionalizing the current moment. Our goal is thus to deprovincialize Trump, that is, to locate his election within broader historical, political, and economic assemblages of which it is but one part."..."This effort might include [studying] Trump's [[xenophobia]], [[bombast]], and cult of personality, reminiscent of leaders in South Africa, Gambia, Uganda, Libya, and Zimbabwe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/amet.12468 | volume=44 | issue=2 | title=Deprovincializing Trump, decolonizing diversity, and unsettling anthropology | year=2017 | journal=American Ethnologist | pages=201–208 [201] | last1 = Rosa | first1 = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, stressing Trumps's own actions towards strengthening his own cult of personality, [[University of London|University of London U.S. Centre on American Politics and Policy]]'s Daniel Kato noted that "according to [[political theorist]] [[Hannah Arendt]]'s thinking Trump may yet hunker down, drawing strength from the resistance to him, and continue to consolidate his cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/02/08/political-philosophy-suggests-that-trump-will-either-double-down-on-his-behaviour-or-eventually-give-in-to-institutional-opposition/ ''Political philosophy suggests that Trump will either double down on his behavior or eventually give in to institutional opposition.''] Daniel Kato.

According to Tomas Straka of [[Andres Bello University]], Chávez's cult of personality began following the [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts]] which Chávez led, with Straka explaining that some Venezuelans "saw no solution to their most fundamental problems and they saw in Chávez a savior, or an avenger of those groups that had no hope".&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; Since the beginning of Chávez's tenure in 1999, the Venezuelan government manipulated the Venezuelan public with social programs depicting him as a great leader for the people.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; The struggles that Chávez endured throughout his presidency, such as the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], also drew compassion from his followers which boosted his support.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; By the time of Chávez's death, speculation about potential Chavista reactions to his death were compared to the sorrow felt by those in [[North Korea]] who mourned the death of [[Kim Jong-il]],&lt;ref name=ABCcult&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rueda|first1=Manuela|title=The Cult Following of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/venezuelas-hugo-chavez-cult-created/story?id=18186070|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=[[ABC News]]|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one scholar of Latin America from the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], Juan Pablo Lupi, stating that the creation of Chávez's cult of personality was "very well-staged, all this process of myth-making and appealing to the feelings and religious sentiment of the people.

The [[Vietnam]]ese communist regime has continually maintained a personality cult around [[Ho Chi Minh]] since the 1950s in the [[North Vietnam|North]], and it was later extended to the [[South Vietnam|South]] after [[Vietnamese reunification|reunification]], which it sees as a crucial part of its propaganda campaign surrounding Ho and the Party's past. Ho Chi Minh is frequently glorified in schools by schoolchildren. Opinions, publications and broadcasts that are critical of Ho Chi Minh or that identify his flaws are banned in Vietnam, and the commentators are arrested or fined for "opposing the people's revolution". Ho Chi Minh is even glorified to a religious status as an "immortal saint" by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]], and some people "worship the President", according to a BBC report.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was officially renamed [[Ho Chi Minh City]] on 1 May 1975, one day after its [[Fall of Saigon|capture]], which officially ended the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18328455 | title=Uncle Ho's legacy lives on in Vietnam | first=Viv | last=Marsh | work=BBC News | date=6 June 2012 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josip Broz Tito]] (in power from 1945 until 1980) developed cult of personality around himself.

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] used his cult of personality to create a god-like public image of himself in [[Zaire]], which today is the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Mobutu created a centralized state, amassed massive wealth for himself and presided over the economic deterioration of his country and [[human rights]] abuses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Mobutu embarked on a campaign of pro-African cultural awareness and in 1972, he formally changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga ("The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.")&lt;ref&gt;There are multiple translations of the full name, including "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake", "the earthy, the peppery, all-powerful warrior who, by his endurance and will to win, goes from contest to contest leaving fire in his wake" and "the man who flies from victory to victory and leaves nothing behind him"&lt;http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/N04.html#Sese&gt; and "the all-powerful warrior who goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake" (Wrong, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6237">'''Maternalism''' is the viewpoint that incorporates a common idea of [[femininity]] and applies it as a support for women’s involvement in society.

==History==
Maternalism emerged in the late 19th Century, as a companion to [[progressive reform]]. The [[theology]] followed the idea that women had in-born qualities based on their maternalistic instincts. These inborn qualities qualified women to operate outside the home. Women of this time argued that women were uniquely qualified for certain jobs and places in the [[political sphere]] based on their domestic abilities and child-rearing qualities.
This political mindset continued into the 20th century, influencing government reform and females in the [[workplace]].&lt;ref name="Muncy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muncy|first1=Robyn|title=Creating a Female Dominion in Reform, 1890-1935|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195089240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mink"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mink|first1=Gwendolyn|title=The wages of motherhood : inequality in the welfare state, 1917-1942|date=1996|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=978-0801495342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternalistic professionals, particularly medical doctors, do not dictate to people what to do. They guide their clients gently and give them autonomy without making them feel totally alone or unsupported. Maternalistic people allow people to make decisions, even if they end up being mistakes in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-horn/maternalism-in-medicine_b_6566736.html Maternalism in Medicine] at Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Progressive reform===
[[Social settlement]]s, founded mainly by middle class women, became popular in urban environments in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They provided [[public housing]] and resources to working-class people and newly arrived [[immigrant]]s. Middle class women who ran these settlements worked with immigrants for progressive reform, such as the regulation of [[workers' compensation]] and [[child labor]] laws. Major settlements included [[Hull House]] in Chicago and [[Toynbee Hall]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=2016|chapter=Social settlement|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/social-settlement|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Female Professions===
Acceptable female work during this time included school teachers and nursing. In 1910,
5%-6% of Doctors were female;
1% of Lawyers were female;
1% of Clergy were female.
Women achieved greater success in creating female oriented jobs than breaking into male dominated jobs during this time, by creating professions designed around their domestic and maternal qualities.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt; [[Home Economics]] emerged in the 1890s at MIT and the University of Chicago. Women studied science and used experiments to influence politics. Female-led labs studied ways to create cleaner water and better American sewers.
[[Public Health Nursing]] was created as an alternative to traditional nursing. This allowed women to have their own private practices and to not have to work under men. However, most women served communities who couldn’t pay, which limited their resources and income. [[Social work]] primarily operated in social settlements, serving immigrant women and children. Since many of their clients could not pay, social workers were key players in pushing for progressive reform.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Major Players==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards]] was a chemist who graduated from Uc Madera in california and founded Home Economics. Richards set up labs at Universities across the country aimed at sanitation and teaching women the sciences. Richards was a key player in maternalist politics as she applied her scientific knowledge to domestic issues in politics, pushing for good nutrition and sanitation.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen H. Swallow Richards|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/ellen-h-swallow-richards|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lugenia Burns Hope]] was one of the first professional social workers. In 1908 in Atlanta Georgia she founded the Neighborhood Union, which aimed to mobilize and enfranchise poor black neighborhoods in the city.&lt;ref name="Cardoza-Oquendo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardoza-Oquendo|first1=Juan|title=Lugenia Burns Hope|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/lugenia-burns-hope-1871-1947|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Addams]] co-founded Hull House in Chicago in 1889.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; A strong proponent for maternalist politics and progressive reform, she started many initiatives such as clean food and clean drinking water, which gained momentum in the social movement.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Critique==
Maternalism has been criticized on the grounds that it keeps women out of male dominated professions.  It also reinforces a normalized idea of femininity, without considering the fluidity of gender.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Eirinn|title=Gender and the welfare state: Maternalism - a new historical concept?|date=1996|publisher=University of Bergen, Norway|url=http://www.ub.uib.no/elpub/1996/h/506002/eirinn/eirinn.html|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that advertisers had used images of strong working women to encourage women to enter the workforce in support of the war effort, advertisers after the war presented images of maternalism to pressure women to leave the workforce and return to their homes, so that positions could be filled by men returning from wartime. Women were told that their nurturing abilities would be better served waiting on their husbands and children.&lt;ref name="Weigand"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weigand|first1=Kate|title=Red feminism : American communism and the making of women's liberation|date=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md. ; London|isbn=978-0801871115|pages=46–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S-a6fBuNsEC&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mixed economy''' is variously defined as an [[economic system]] blending elements of [[Market economy |market economies]] with elements of [[planned economies]], [[free market]]s with [[state interventionism]], or [[private enterprise]] with [[public enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Schiller, Bradley. ''The Micro Economy Today'', McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2010, p. 15. "''Mixed economy'' - An economy that uses both market signals and government directives to allocate goods and resources." This follows immediately from a discussion on ''command economies'' and ''market mechanism''.

"In a market economy, the private-sector businesses and consumers decide what they will produce and purchase, with little government intervention....In a command economy, also known as a planned economy, the government largely determines what is produced and in what amounts. In a mixed economy, both market forces and government decisions determine which goods and services are produced and how they are distributed."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single definition of a mixed economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:mixed+economy A variety  of definitions for mixed economy.]&lt;/ref&gt; but rather two major definitions recognized{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} for a "mixed economy". The first of these definitions refers to a mixture of markets with state interventionism, referring to [[capitalist]] [[market economies]] with strong [[Regulation|regulatory]] oversight, interventionist policies and governmental provision of [[public service]]s. The second definition is apolitical in nature and strictly refers to an economy containing a mixture of private enterprise with public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Douglas | title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School | publisher= Routledge|date= November 11, 2011 |isbn= 978-0415608794 |pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, and particularly with reference to Western economies, the term "mixed economy" refers to a capitalist economy characterized by the predominance of private ownership of the [[means of production]] with profit-seeking enterprise and the [[accumulation of capital]] as its fundamental driving force.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In such a system, markets are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and governments wield indirect [[macroeconomic]] influence through [[Fiscal policy| fiscal]] and [[Monetary policy| monetary policies]] with a view to counteracting capitalism's history of [[Business cycle| boom/bust cycles]], [[unemployment]] and [[Economic inequality |income disparities]]. In this framework, varying degrees of public utilities and essential services operate under public ownership and state activity is often limited to providing public goods and universal civic requirements - such as [[healthcare]], [[physical infrastructure]] and management of [[public lands]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007. '"Resurrection of the Rentier", book review of Andrew Glyn's ''Capitalism Unleashed:Finance, Globalization and Welfare''. ''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and in particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy's means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes's framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Rees |first= Merlyn |title= [[The Public Sector in the Mixed Economy]] |publisher= Bratsford|date= 1973 |isbn= 978-0713413724 |pages = 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to [[post-war]] Western and Northern European economic models as championed by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], the mixed economy is defined{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a form of capitalism where most industries are privately owned with only a small number of public utilities and essential services under public ownership. In the [[post-war era]], European social democracy became associated with this economic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Craig |first= Edward |title= [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Volume 8 | publisher= Routledge|date= June 1998 |isbn= 978-0415187138 |pages = 827|quote= In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Political ideology |economic ideal]], mixed economies are supported by people of various political persuasions, typically [[Centre-left politics| centre-left]] and [[Centre-right politics| centre-right]], such as social democrats&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
or Christian democrats.

The label "mixed economy" can also refer to [[socialist]] economies with a substantial role for non-[[Social ownership|social]] or non-public forms of ownership in the means of production, or to [[Soviet-type economic planning | Soviet-type planned economies]] that have been reformed to allow a greater role for [[market forces]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Etymology==
There is not only one definition of a mixed economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:mixed+economy A variety  of definitions for mixed economy.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are generally two major definitions, one being political and the other apolitical.

The political definition of a mixed economy refers to the degree of [[state interventionism]] in a market economy, portraying the state as encroaching onto the market under the assumption that the market is the "natural" mechanism for allocating resources. The political definition is limited to capitalistic economies and precludes an extension to non-capitalist systems, being concerned with [[public policy]] and state influence in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= There are in general two broad yet distinguishable definitions of 'mixed economy': a political definition and an apolitical definition. The political definition refers to the degree of state intervention in what is basically a market economy. Thus this definition 'portray[s] the phenomenon in terms of state encroaching upon the market and thereby suggest[s] that market is the natural or preferable mechanism...The political definition of 'mixed economy' precludes extending it to non-capitalist systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the apolitical definition relates to patterns of ownership and management of economic enterprises in an economy.

The apolitical definition of mixed economy strictly refers to a mix of public and private ownership of enterprises in the economy and is unconcerned with political forms and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The term "mixed economy" arose in the context of political debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the postwar period, although the set of policies later associated with the term had been advocated from at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reisman, David A. |title=Theories of the Mixed Economy (Theories of the mixed economy) |publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto Ltd |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=1-85196-214-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the mixed economy, including [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-04-323014-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tawney, R. H. |title=Equality |publisher=Allen and Unwin |location=London |year=1964 |pages= |isbn=0-04-323014-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Crosland]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-8371-9586-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Crosland, A. |title=The Future of socialism |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-8371-9586-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Shonfield]] were mostly associated with the [[British Labour Party]], although similar views were expressed by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] including [[Harold Macmillan]]. Critics of the mixed economy, including [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]], argued that there can be no lasting middle ground between economic planning and a market economy and any move in the direction of socialist planning is an unintentional move toward what Hilaire Bloc called "[[The Servile State|the servile state]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' St. Martin's Press (1991), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
In the apolitical sense, the term "mixed economy" is used to describe economic systems which combine various elements of [[Market (economics)|market economies]] and [[planned economy|planned economies]]. As most political-economic [[ideology|ideologies]] are defined in an idealized sense, what is described rarely—if ever—exists in practice. Most would not consider it unreasonable to label an economy that, while not being a perfect representation, very closely resembles an ideal by applying the rubric that denominates that ideal. When a system in question, however, diverges to a significant extent from an idealized [[Model (macroeconomics)|economic model]] or ideology, the task of identifying it can become problematic. Hence, the term "mixed economy" was coined. As it is unlikely that an economy will contain a perfectly even mix, mixed economies are usually noted as being skewed towards either [[private ownership]] or [[public ownership]], toward [[capitalism]] or [[socialism]], or toward a [[market economy]] or [[command economy]] in varying degrees.&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/3639233832 Financial Markets in Vietnam's Transition Economy: Facts, Insights, Implications.] {{ISBN|978-3-639-23383-4}}, [[VDM Verlag]], Feb. 2010, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholic social teaching ===
Jesuit author [[David Hollenbach]], S.J. has argued that [[Catholic social teaching]] calls for a "new form" of mixed economy. He refers back to [[Pope Pius XI]]'s statement that government "should supply help to the members of the social body, but may never destroy or absorb them".&lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno.html ''Quadragesimo Anno''], para 79, published 15 May 1931, accessed 12 August 2018; the papal text refers to "every social activity", not only to government.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollenbach writes that a socially just mixed economy involves labour, management and the state working together through a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] system that distributes economic power widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=132–133|author1=David Hollenbach, S.J.|chapter=Unemployment and Jobs: A Theological and Ethical Perspective|editor-last=Houck|editor-first=John||editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Oliver|title=Catholic social teaching and the United States economy: working papers for a bishops' pastoral|publisher=University Press of America|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, subsequent scholars have noted that conceiving of subsidiarity as a "top-down, government-driven political exercise" requires a selective reading of 1960s encyclicals. A more comprehensive reading of Catholic social teaching suggests a conceptualization of subsidiarity as a "bottom-up concept" that is "rooted in recognition of a common humanity, not in the political equivalent of ''noblese oblige''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=454|author1=Denis O'Brien|chapter=Subsidiarity and Solidarity|editor-last=Booth|editor-first=Phillip|||title=Catholic social teaching and the market economy|publisher=The Institute of Economic Affairs|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European social democracy ===
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
In the early [[post-war]] era in Western Europe, social democratic parties rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternate path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|pp=102-103|ps=: "The emergence of social democracy was partly a result of the Cold War. People argued that if the Stalinist Soviet empire, where the state controlled everything, showed socialism in action, then socialism was not worth having. [...] The consensus policies of a mixed and managed economy and the welfare state, developed by the post-war Labour government, seemed in themselves to provide a basis for a viable socialism that would combine prosperity and freedom with social justice and the possibility of a full life for everyone. They could be seen as a compromise between socialism and capitalism."}} In this period, social democrats embraced a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential utilities and public services under public ownership. As a result, social democracy became associated with [[Keynesian economics]], state interventionism and the welfare state, while abandoning the prior goal of replacing the capitalist system (factor markets, [[private property]] and [[wage labour]]){{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10|ps=: "Thus social democrats do not try to do away with either the market or private property ownership; instead, they attempt to create conditions in which the operation of a capitalist market economy will lead to more egalitarian outcomes and encourage more democratic and more solidaristic practices than would a more conventional capitalist system."}} with a qualitatively different socialist [[economic system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=1410|ps=: "In addition, particularly since World War II, distinctions have sometimes been made between social democrats and socialists on the basis that the former have accepted the permanence of the mixed economy and have abandoned the idea of replacing the capitalist system with a qualitatively different socialist society."}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|pp=125–128|ps=: "As an ideological stance, social democracy took shape around the mid-twentieth century, resulting from the tendency among western socialist parties not only to adopt parliamentary strategies, but also to revise their socialist goals. In particular, they abandoned the goal of abolishing capitalism and sought instead to reform or ‘humanize’ it. Social democracy therefore came to stand for a broad balance between the market economy, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other."}}

=== Fascism ===
Although [[fascism]] is primarily a political ideology that stresses the importance of cultural and social issues over economics, fascism is generally supportive of a broadly capitalistic mixed economy. Fascism supports a state interventionism into markets and private enterprise, alongside a [[corporatist]] framework referred to as the "[[third position]]" that ostensibly aims to be a middle-ground between socialism and capitalism by mediating labour and business disputes to promote national unity. 20th century fascist regimes in Italy and Germany adopted large public works programs to stimulate their economies, state interventionism in largely private-sector dominated economies to promote re-armament and national interests. Scholars have drawn parallels between the American [[New Deal]] and public works programs promoted by fascism, arguing that fascism similarly arose in response to the threat of socialist revolution and similarly aimed to "save capitalism" and private property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Fascism'', by Gupta, Dipankar. 1977. Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 12, No. 25 (Jun. 18, 1977), pp. 987-992 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism ===
"Mixed economies" as a mixture of socially-owned and private enterprise have been predicted and advocated by various socialists as a necessary transitional form between capitalism and socialism. Additionally, a number of proposals for socialist systems call for a mixture of different forms of enterprise ownership including a role for private enterprise. For example, [[Alexander Nove]]'s conception of "feasible socialism" outlines an economic system based on a combination of state-enterprises for large industries, worker and consumer cooperatives, private enterprises for small-scale operations and individually owned enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan – Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The social democratic theorist [[Eduard Bernstein]] advocated a form of mixed economy, believing that a mixed system of [[Public enterprise|public]], [[cooperative]] and [[private enterprise]] would be necessary for a long period of time before capitalism would evolve of its own accord into socialism.&lt;ref name="Steger, Manfred B. 1997. pg. 146"&gt;Steger, Manfred B.  ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein And Social Democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pg. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]] adopted a [[socialist market economy]], which represents an early stage of socialist development according to the [[Communist Party of China]]. The Communist Party takes the [[Marxism|Marxist]] position that an economic system containing diverse forms of ownership—but with the public sector playing a decisive role—is a necessary characteristic of an economy in the preliminary stage of developing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/article/topic/bizchina/economicsystem/200406/20040600239133.shtml|title=Socialist Market Economic System |last= |first= |publisher=Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China |date=June 25, 2004 |website= |access-date=February 8, 2018|quote= The development of the economic system with public ownership playing a dominant role and diverse forms of ownership developing side by side is a basic characteristic of the socialist economic system at the preliminary stage. This is decided by the quality of socialism and the national situation in preliminary stage: first, China, as a socialist country, should persist in public ownership as the base of the socialist economy; second, China, as in its preliminary stage, should develop diverse forms of ownership on condition that the public ownership plays a dominant role }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] describes its economy as a "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]" that consists of a mixture of public, private and cooperative enterprise—a mixed economy that is oriented toward the long-term development of a socialist economy.

== Typology ==
=== Mix of free markets and state intervention ===
This meaning of a mixed economy refers to a combination of market forces with state intervention in the form of regulations, macroeconomic policies and social welfare interventions aimed at improving market outcomes. As such, this type of mixed economy falls under the framework of a capitalistic market economy, with macroeconomic interventions aimed at promoting the stability of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007. '"Resurrection of the Rentier", book review of Andrew Glyn's ''Capitalism Unleashed:Finance, Globalization and Welfare''. ''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and n particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy’s means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes’s framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of common government activity in this form of mixed economy include [[environmental protection]], maintenance of [[employment standards]], a standardized [[welfare]] system and [[competition law|maintenance of competition]].

Most contemporary market-oriented economies fall under this category, including the [[economy of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.usembassy.de/economy-conditions.htm U.S. Economy - Basic Conditions &amp; Resources]. U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany. "The United States is said to have a mixed economy because privately owned businesses and government both play important roles."

U.S. Embassy Information Resource Center. "As a result, the American economy is perhaps better described as a "mixed" economy, with government playing an important role along with private enterprise. Although Americans often disagree about exactly where to draw the line between their beliefs in both free enterprise and government management, the mixed economy they have developed has been remarkably successful." Accessed: October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe the economies of countries that feature extensive [[welfare state]]s, such as the [[Nordic model]] practiced by the [[Nordic countries]], which combine free-market capitalism with an extensive welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Lahti, Arto.

The German [[social market economy]] is the economic policy of modern Germany that steers a middle path between the goals of social democracy and capitalism within the framework of a private market economy and aims at maintaining a balance between a high rate of economic growth, low inflation, low levels of unemployment, good working conditions, public welfare and public services by using state intervention. Under its influence, Germany emerged from desolation and defeat to become an industrial giant within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The [[American School (economics)|American School]] (also known as the National System) is the economic philosophy that dominated United States national policies from the time of the [[American Civil War]] until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1061.html "The Progressive Movement"]. United States History. Retrieved February 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of three core policy initiatives: protecting industry through high tariffs (1861–1932; changing to subsidies and reciprocity from 1932–1970s), government investment in infrastructure through [[internal improvements]] and a national [[bank]] to promote the growth of productive enterprises. During this period, the United States grew into the largest economy in the world, surpassing the United Kingdom (though not the [[British Empire]]) by 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Modern British Politics'', [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Political Economy, Robert O'Brien and Marc Williams&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Gill: "By 1880 the United States of America had overtaken and surpassed the UK as industrial leader of the world.: (from ''Trade Wars Against America: A History of United States Trade and Monetary Policy'' Chapter 6 titled "America becomes Number 1" pg. 39–49 – published 1990 by Praeger Publishers in the USA – {{ISBN|0-275-93316-4}})

* Richardson: "By 1865, the Republicans had developed a series of high tariffs and taxes that reflected the economic theories of Carey and Wayland and were designed to strengthen and benefit all parts of the American economy, raising the standard of living for everyone.

=== Mix of private and public enterprise ===
This type of mixed economy specifically refers to a mixture of private and public ownership of industry and the means of production. As such, it is sometimes described as a "middle path" or transitional state between capitalism and socialism, but it can also refer to a mixture of [[state capitalism]] with private capitalism.

Examples include the economies of [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Economy of Norway|Norway]], [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Socialist market economy|China]]—all of which feature large state-owned enterprise sectors operating alongside large private sectors. The French economy featured a large state sector from 1945 until 1986, mixing a substantial amount of state-owned enterprises and nationalized firms with private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press |date=|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 187|quote=After World War II a wave of nationalizations occurred, affecting the Bank of France, the four largest commercial banks, the four leading groups of insurance companies, all electric power and gas producers, the coal mining industry, Air France, and the Renault automobile company (the last specifically because of wartime collabouration with the Nazis by its owner). Until 1981 no other firms  were nationalized, although occasionally new public enterprises were created from scratch or the government bought part of ownership, as it did with Dassault Aircraft in 1978. Until 1986 none of these industries were denationalized.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Chinese economic reforms initiated in 1978, the Chinese economy has reformed its state-owned enterprises and allowed greater scope for private enterprise to operate alongside the state and collective sectors. In the 1990s, the central government concentrated its ownership in strategic sectors of the economy, but local and provincial level state-owned enterprises continue to operate in almost every industry including information technology, automobiles, machinery and hospitality. The latest round of state-owned enterprise reform initiated in 2013 stressed increased dividend payouts of state enterprises to the central government and "mixed ownership reform" which includes partial private investment into state-owned firms. As a result, many nominally private-sector firms are actually partially state-owned by various levels of government and state institutional investors; and many state-owned enterprises are partially privately owned resulting in a "mixed ownership" economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/02/09/the-long-march-to-the-mixed-economy-in-china/ |title=The long march to the mixed economy in China |last= Fan|first= He|publisher=East Asia Forum |date=January 9, 2015 |website= East Asia Forum |access-date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mix of markets and economic planning ===
This type of mixed economy refers to a combination of economic planning with market forces for the guiding of production in an economy and may coincide with a mixture of private and public enterprise. It can include capitalist economies with indicative macroeconomic planning policies and socialist planned economies that introduced market forces into their economies, such as in [[Goulash Communism|Hungary]].

[[Dirigisme]] was an economic policy initiated under [[Charles de Gaulle]] in France, designating an economy where the government exerts strong directive influence through [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]]. In the period of Dirigisme, the French state used indicative economic planning to supplement market forces for guiding its market economy. It involved state control of industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunication infrastructures as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects. Under its influence France experienced what is called "Thirty Glorious Years" of profound economic growth.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;(Gardner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary inaugurated the [[New Economic Mechanism]] reforms in 1968 that introduced market processes into its planned economy. Under this system, firms were still publicly-owned but not subject to physical production targets and output quotas specified by a national plan. Firms were attached to state ministries which had the power to merge, dissolve and reorganize them, and which established the firm's operating sector. Enterprises had to acquire their inputs and sell their outputs in markets, eventually eroding away at the Soviet-style planned economy.

==Criticism==

Numerous economists have questioned the validity of the entire concept of a "mixed economy" when understood to be a mixture of socialism and capitalism.

In ''[[Human Action]]'', [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that there can be no mixture of capitalism and socialism—either market logic or economic planning must dominate an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= There is no mixture of the two systems possible or thinkable; there is no such thing as a mixed economy, a system that would be in part capitalistic and in part socialist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mises elabourated on this point by contending that even if a market economy contained numerous state-run or nationalized enterprises, this would not make the economy "mixed" because the existence of such organizations does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the market economy. These publicly owned enterprises would still be subject to market sovereignty, would have to acquire [[capital good]]s through markets, strive to maximize profits (or at the least try to minimize costs) and utilize monetary accounting for economic calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= The fact that the state or municipalities own and operate some plants does not alter the characteristic features of a market economy. These publicly owned and operated enterprises are subject to the sovereignty of the market. They must fit themselves, as buyers of raw materials, equipment, and labour, and as sellers of goods and services, into the scheme of the market economy. They are subject to the laws of the market and thereby depend on the consumers who may or may not patronize them. They must strive for profits, or at least, to avoid losses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical Marxism|Classical]] and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theorists also dispute the viability of a mixed economy as a "middle ground" between socialism and capitalism. Irrespective of enterprise ownership, either the capitalist [[law of value]] and [[accumulation of capital]] drives the economy, or conscious planning and [[Calculation in kind|non-monetary forms of valuation]] ultimately drive the economy. Therefore from the Great Depression onward extant "mixed economies" in the Western world are still functionally capitalist because they operate on the basis of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch20.htm |title=The Limits of the Mixed Economy |author=Paul Mattick |date=1969 |publisher=Marxism.org |accessdate=17 January 2014 |quote= To be sure, 'orthodox Marxism' maintains that the mixed economy is still the capitalism of old, just as 'orthodox' bourgeois theory insists that the mixed economy is a camouflaged form of socialism. Generally, however, both the state-capitalist and mixed economies are recognized as economic systems adhering to the principle of progress by way of capital accumulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''motion of no-confidence''', alternatively '''vote of no confidence''', or '''(unsuccessful) confidence motion''', is a statement or vote which states that a person(s) in a position of responsibility (government, managerial, etc.) is no longer deemed fit to hold that position, perhaps because they are inadequate in some respect, are failing to carry out obligations, or are making decisions that other members feel detrimental. As a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]], it demonstrates to the [[head of state]] that the elected parliament no longer has confidence in (one or more members of) the appointed [[Executive (government)|government]].

A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion. Depending on the constitution of the body concerned, "No Confidence" may lead to dismissal of the [[Council of Ministers]] or other position-holder(s), whereas "Censure" is meant to show disapproval and does not result in the resignation of ministers. The censure motion can be against an individual minister or a group of ministers, but the no-confidence motion is directed against the entire [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Again, depending on the applicable rules, censure motions may need to state the reasons for the motion while no-confidence motions may not require reasons to be specified.

==Parliamentary systems==
There are a number of variations in this procedure in parliaments. In some countries a motion of no confidence can be directed at the government collectively or at any individual member, including the [[prime minister]]. In [[Spain]] it is presented by the prime minister after consultation. Sometimes motions of no confidence are proposed even though they have no likelihood of passage, simply to pressure a government or to embarrass its own critics, who may for political reasons decide not to vote against it.

In many [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], there are strict time limits for no confidence motions: they may only be allowed once every three, four or six months. Thus the timing of a motion of no confidence is a matter of political judgement; a motion of no confidence on a relatively trivial matter may prove counterproductive if a more important issue suddenly arises which actually warrants a motion of no confidence, because it cannot be proposed if one had been voted on recently. Sometimes, the government will choose to declare that one of its bills is a "motion of confidence" in order to prevent dissident members of their own party voting against it.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom}}
Traditionally, in the [[Westminster system]], the defeat of a [[supply bill]] (one that concerns the spending of money) is seen to automatically require the government to either resign or ask for a new election, much like a non-confidence vote.  A government in a Westminster system that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called [[loss of supply]]. When the upper house of a Westminster system country has the right to refuse supply, such as in Australia during [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|the events of 1975]], the convention is in a grey area, as Westminster governments are not normally expected to maintain the confidence of the upper house.

Prior to 2011, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], a no-confidence motion generally first appeared as an [[early day motion]], although the vote on the [[Speech from the Throne]] also constituted a confidence motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m07.pdf |title=House of Commons Factsheet M7: Parliamentary Elections |publisher=House of Commons Information office |page=3 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], only a motion explicitly resolving "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government" is treated as a motion of no confidence.

===India===
In India, a motion of no confidence can be introduced only in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of India]]). The motion is admitted for discussion when a minimum of 50 members of the house support the motion.&lt;ref name="Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-08-11/news/41295707_1_trust-vote-no-confidence-motion-no-confidence-motion|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=11 Aug 2013|quote=the move could not even take off as Banerjee's party failed to muster the support of even 506 members, the minimum required for bringing a no trust motion.|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the motion carries, the House debates and votes on the motion. If a majority of the members of the house vote in favour of the motion, the motion is passed and the Government is bound to vacate the office. [[Acharya Kripalani]] moved the first-ever no confidence motion on the floor of the Lok Sabha in August 1963, immediately after the disastrous [[Sino-Indian War|India–China War]].&lt;ref name="Procedure regarding motion of no-confidence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedure regarding motion of no-confidence|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rulep17.html|accessdate=9 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709234757/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rulep17.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rules of confidence|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rules-of-confidence/334634/0|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=12 July 2008|quote=What happens if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence? In such a case, he is obliged to resign}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, 27 no-confidence motions have been moved. Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] faced the most number of no-confidence motions – 15 times, followed by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and [[P._V._Narasimha_Rao]] (thrice each), [[Morarji Desai]] (twice) and [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]],  [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Narendra Modi]] (once each). All the no-confidence motions have been defeated except when Prime Minister Morarji Desai resigned during the discussions on 12 July 1979 and most recently no-confidence motion against Narendra Modi's (BJP) government  was accepted by the lok sabha speaker, but was defeated..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History gives Congress a slight margin – 60:40|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/history-gives-congress-a-slight-margin-60-40/story-ykttDlla1f8TmOSpiWUuiJ.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=hindustantimes.com/|date=22 July 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LS to witness 26th no-confidence motion in its history|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/LS-to-witness-26th-no-confidence-motion-in-its-history/articleshow/134440.cms|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the anti-defection law, the vote of no-confidence has no relevance left in case the majority party has an absolute majority in the House. If the majority party (with an absolute majority in the House) issues a whip to party members to vote in favor of the Government, then it is impossible to remove the Government by a no-confidence motion. Hence the no-confidence exercise of House merely becomes the no-confidence exercise of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S|date=Jun 2017|title=Threatening Indian democratic system: Case of Anti-Defection Law|url=http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8546:threatening-indian-democratic-system-case-of-anti-defection-law&amp;catid=124:research&amp;Itemid=140|journal=The Voice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf Constitution of Italy]. Retrieved 3 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the government requires the support of both houses of [[Parliament]]. A vote of no confidence may be proposed if one tenth of the members of a single house sign the proposition and starting from three days before the appointed date, said vote can be brought into discussion. Following the case of [[Filippo Mancuso]] in 1995 and the subsequent [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] sentence in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giurcost.org/decisioni/1996/0007s-96.htm|title=Sentenza n. 7 del 1996|date=|accessdate=3 January 2015|publisher=giurcost.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to propose an individual vote of no confidence against a single [[Minister (government)|minister]] instead of the whole government.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="germanconst"&gt;[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf German Constitution Official English Translation] Article 67 - Vote of No Confidence&lt;/ref&gt; a vote of no confidence in the [[Chancellor of Germany|Federal Chancellor]] requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the [[President of Germany|Federal President]]. Thus, a motion of no confidence can only be brought forward if there is a positive majority for the new candidate (this variation is called a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]). The idea was to prevent crises of the state such as those found near the end of the German [[Weimar Republic]].  Frequently, Chancellors were turned out of office without their successors having enough parliamentary support to govern. Unlike the British system, the Chancellor does not have to resign in response to the failure of a vote of confidence, provided it has been initiated by them and not by the parliamentary opposition, but rather may ask the President to call general elections &amp;ndash; a request the President may or may not fulfill.

===Japan===
Article 69 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]] provides that "if the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] shall resign en masse, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within ten (10) days."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Constitution of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In federal politics, a vote of no confidence takes down the government, and votes of no confidence may be asserted automatically if the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] rejects the government's budget. Provincial governments may also fall if a motion of no confidence is passed by the legislature or if the legislature fails to pass a confidence measure (e.g. the provincial budget).

In the [[consensus government]] system of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], in which the premier is chosen among and by a vote of the members of the non-partisan legislature, a vote of no confidence removes the premier and cabinet from office and permits the members to elect a new premier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2009/02/04/nwt-leg.html (CBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

In the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]], a motion of no-confidence requires a [[majority#Application in other voting requirements|majority of the members present]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to agree to it. The House of Representatives currently consists of 150 members; requiring 76 votes in favour of the motion when all members of the House are present. A straight vote of no confidence in a [[Australian Government|government]], or a motion or amendment censuring a government, has never been successful in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=AHoR/&gt; Despite this, on eight occasions governments have either resigned or advised a dissolution following their defeat on other questions before the House.&lt;ref name=AHoR/&gt; The last time a government resigned after being defeated in the House came in October 1941, when the House rejected the budget of [[Arthur Fadden]]'s minority government.

Specific motions of no confidence or [[censure|censure motion]]s against the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], ministers, the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Australian Senate|Senators]] and leaders of political parties have been moved and have been successful on some occasions. Motions of no confidence against the government may be passed in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], yet may have little or no impact in the House.&lt;ref name=AHoR&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter9&amp;section=07&amp;fullscreen=1 |title=Motions of no confidence and censure |work=House of Representatives Practice |edition=6th |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |location=Canberra |date= |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
On 7 August 2017, Speaker [[Baleka Mbete]] announced that she would permit a motion of no confidence in [[Jacob Zuma]]'s government to proceed in the National Assembly via [[secret ballot]]. It was the eighth motion to be brought against Zuma in his presidency and the first to be held via secret ballot. After the vote was held the next day, the motion was defeated 198–177, with 25 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-zuma-survives-vote-of-no-confidence-20170808]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 20 [[ANC]] MPs voted in favor of the measure.

===Pakistan===
The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] has provision for a no-confidence motion in all constituents of the [[Electoral College (Pakistan)|Electoral College]] of the state. The motions can target speakers and deputy speakers of [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|provincial]] and [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan|national assemblies]], the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], [[List of current Pakistani chief ministers|chief ministers]] of provinces, as well as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]].&lt;ref name="CoP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html|title=Part III: The Federation of Pakistan: Chapter 3: The Federal Government|last=|first=|date=|website=The Constitution of Pakistan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it can be put for vote on the pertinent house's floor, it needs to have the backing of at least 20% of the elected members in all cases except those moved against speakers or deputy speakers, in which case there is no minimum support limit. After being put to vote, the motion is only deemed successful once passed by a majority.&lt;ref name="Pak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/275417|title=Three speakers removed by opposition in past|last=|first=|date=19 December 2010|website=The News International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of history, the no-confidence has mostly been used in removing speakers and deputy speakers. Of the 11 times the motion has been invoked in the country's parliamentary history, 9 motions targeted these posts with 4 being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/774105|title=BA passes no-confidence motion against Aslam Bhootani|last=|first=|date=26 December 2012|website=Dawn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pak" /&gt; An incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan has only been subject to a no-confidence vote once, in November 1989, when [[Benazir Bhutto]] faced an ultimately unsuccessful motion moved by [[Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/02/world/bhutto-survives-as-no-confidence-vote-falls-short.html|title=Bhutto Survives as No-Confidence Vote Falls Short|last=Burns|first=John|date=2 November 1989|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is the case for a provincial chief minister, as the only instance of its use is the one moved against Chief Minister of [[List of Chief Ministers of Balochistan|Balochistan]], [[Sanaullah Zehri]] in January 2018, which was successful as Zehri resigned before the vote could take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1604243/1-pm-advises-cm-zehri-step-thwart-political-crisis-balochistan/|title=Balochistan CM Zehri quits to avoid no-trust vote|last=Zafar|first=Muhammad|date=9 January 2018|website=The Express Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semi-presidential systems==
In [[semi-presidential systems]], the legislature may occasionally pass motions of no confidence, which removes only the cabinet and prime minister, the legislature may also have the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] an executive or judicial officer, with another institution or the legislature removing the officer from their office.

===Russia===
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], the lower house of parliament (the [[State Duma]]) may by a [[majority|simple majority]] (i.e. at least 226 votes out of 450) pass a motion of no confidence against the [[Government of Russia]] as a whole. In this case, the matter goes for consideration of the [[President of Russia|President]], who may choose to dismiss the cabinet (which the President can do at any moment in time at his own discretion anyway) or just to ignore the Duma's decision. Should the Duma pass a second motion of no confidence against the same composition of the cabinet within three months, the President will be forced to make a concrete decision – to dismiss the government or to dissolve the Duma itself and call for new general elections. The State Duma may not be dissolved on these grounds if it was elected less than a year earlier, if it has already initiated impeachment proceedings against the President himself by bringing respective accusations, if less than six months is left until elections of the President, or if there is a state of emergency or martial law throughout the whole territory of Russian Federation. In the above-mentioned cases, the President would therefore be effectively forced to dismiss the Government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==History==
{{See also|List of prime ministers defeated by votes of no confidence}}
The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} when, following news of the [[Siege of Yorktown|British defeat at Yorktown]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] the previous October, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] voted that they "can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers". [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] responded by asking [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to accept his resignation. This did not immediately create a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. During the early 19th century, however, attempts by prime ministers such as [[Robert Peel]] to govern in the absence of a parliamentary majority proved unsuccessful, and by the mid-19th century, the power of a motion of no confidence to break a government was firmly established in the UK.

In the United Kingdom, 11 prime ministers have been defeated through a no-confidence motion. There has been only [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|one]] (against [[James Callaghan]]) since 1925.

In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is a relatively rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, [[party discipline]] is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence, and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies rather than lose a vote of no confidence. The cases in which a motion of no confidence has passed are generally those in which the government party's slim majority has been eliminated by either [[by-election]]s or defections, such as the [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry]] in the UK which was carried by one vote, forcing a general election which was won by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

Motions of no confidence are far more common in multi-party systems in which a minority party must form a [[coalition government]]. This can mean that there have been many short-lived governments because the party structure allows small parties to defeat a government without means{{clarify|date=November 2015}} to create a government. This has widely been regarded as the cause of instability for the [[French Fourth Republic]] and the German [[Weimar Republic]]. More recent examples have been in [[Italy]] between the 1950s and 1990s, [[Israel]], and [[Politics of Japan|Japan]].

To deal with this situation, the French placed a greater degree of executive power in the office of its [[President of France|President]], who is immune from motions of no confidence, along with a [[Two-round system|two-round]] [[plurality voting system]] that makes easier the formation of stable [[majority government]]s.

In 2008, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], of the re-appointed minority government of Canada, requested that Governor-General Michaëlle Jean [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue Parliament]]. The request was granted, and it allowed the Prime Minister to delay a potential vote on the non-confidence motion presented by the opposition. (See [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]].) Three years later, in 2011, Harper's minority government was defeated by a motion of non-confidence declaring the government to be in [[contempt of Parliament]], leading to [[Canadian federal election, 2011|the election that year]].

In 2013, during the [[Euromaidan]] pro-EU riots, the opposition in [[Ukraine]] called for a motion of no confidence against the Cabinet of Ministers and pro-Russian, [[Euroskeptic]] Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]]. At least 226 votes were needed to gain a majority in the [[Verkhovna Rada]], Ukraine's parliament. However, it fell 40 votes short, and Azarov's government prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ukraine Government Survives No-Confidence Vote |last1=Marson |first1=James |last2=Bendavid |first2=Naftali |date=3 December 2013 |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304355104579235514281922206 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2018, the [[Rajoy government#Second Rajoy government (2016–2018)|Government]] of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was ousted after a motion of no confidence passed 180–169 following the sentence of the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel corruption scandal]] which involved the ruling party.

[[File:RGBL I 1935 S 1145.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Title page of the German [[government gazette]] ''Reichsgesetzblatt'' issue proclaiming the laws, published on 16 September 1935 (RGB I No. 100)]]

The '''Nuremberg Laws''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Nürnberger Gesetze}}) were [[antisemitic]] and [[Racism|racial]] laws in [[Nazi Germany]]. They were enacted by the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] on 15&amp;nbsp;September 1935, at a special meeting convened during the annual [[Nuremberg Rally]] of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The two laws were the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour, which forbade marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between [[Jews]] and Germans  and the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households; and the Reich Citizenship Law, which declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights. A supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law officially came into force on that date. The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include [[Romani people]]. This supplementary decree defined Romanis as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews.

Out of foreign policy concerns, prosecutions under the two laws did not commence until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. After the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|seized power]] in 1933, they began to implement their policies, which included the formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race. [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of Nazi Germany (1933–1945)|Chancellor]] and [[Führer]] (leader) [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]] on 1 April 1933, and the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April, excluded [[Aryan race#Nazism|non-Aryans]] from the legal profession and civil service. Books considered un-German, including those by Jewish authors, were destroyed in a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] on 10 May. Jewish citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks. They were actively suppressed, stripped of their citizenship and civil rights, and eventually completely removed from German society.

The Nuremberg Laws had a crippling economic and social impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed due to lack of customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the [[Madagascar Plan]] proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.

==Background==
{{Main|Nazi eugenics|Nazism and race}}
The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; Nazi Party) was one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties active in Germany after the end of the First World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170–171}} The party platform included removal of the [[Weimar Republic]], rejection of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], radical antisemitism, and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179–180}}

While imprisoned in 1924 after the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]], Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to his deputy, [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}} The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology in which he laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in [[Jewish Bolshevism]], a conspiracy theory that posited the existence of an international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his [[world view]] as expounded in ''Mein Kampf''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=148–150}} The NSDAP advocated the concept of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a [[foreign races|foreign race]] (''Fremdvölkische'').{{sfn|Wildt|2012|pp=96–97}}

==Nazi Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14469, Berlin, Boykott-Posten vor jüdischem Warenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] picket in front of a Jewish place of business during the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], 1 April 1933.]]
Discrimination against Jews intensified after the NSDAP seized power; following a month-long series of attacks by members of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; paramilitary wing of the NSDAP) on Jewish businesses, synagogues, and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=203}} By 1933, many people who were not NSDAP members advocated segregating Jews from the rest of German society.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=539}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} In 1934, the NSDAP published a pamphlet titled ''"Warum Arierparagraph?"'' ("Why the Aryan Law?"), which summarised the perceived need for the law.{{sfn|Schulz|Frercks|1934}} As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] was held on 10 May.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=39}} Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67–69}} Legislation passed in July 1933 stripped naturalised German Jews of their citizenship, creating a legal basis for recent immigrants (particularly Eastern European Jews) to be deported.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} Throughout 1933 and 1934, Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}

Other laws promulgated in this period included the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (passed on 14 July 1933), which called for the compulsory sterilisation of people with a range of hereditary, physical, and mental illnesses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=507}} Under the Law against Dangerous Habitual Criminals (passed 24 November 1935), habitual criminals were forced to undergo sterilisation as well.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=511}} This law was also used to force the incarceration in prison or [[Nazi concentration camps]] of "social misfits" such as the chronically unemployed, prostitutes, beggars, alcoholics, homeless vagrants, and [[Romani people|Romani]] (referred to as "Gypsies").{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=49}}

===Reich Gypsy Law===
The Central Office for Combatting Gypsies was established in 1929.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1070}} In December 1938 ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] issued an order for "combatting the Gypsy plague". Romanis were to be categorised in terms of their Roma ancestry as a racial characteristic, rather than their previous association as 'anti-social' elements of society.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}} This work was advanced by Dr Robert Ritter of the Racial Hygiene and Population unit of the Ministry of Health, who by 1942, had produced a scale of ZM+, ZM of the first and second degree, and ZM- to reflect an individual's decreasing level of Romani ancestry.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=1070–1071}} This classification meant that one could be classified as Roma and subject to anti-Roma legislation on the basis of having two Roma great-great grandparents.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=96}} Dr Zindel of the Ministry of the Interior prepared a draft of a Reich "Gypsy Law" intended to supplement and accompany the Nuremberg Laws. According to Zindel, the "Gypsy problem" could not be dealt with by forced resettlement or imprisonment within Germany. He recommended identification and registration of all Roma, followed by sterilisation and deportation. In 1938, public health authorities were ordered to register all Roma and Roma ''Mischlinge''.{{sfn|Grenville|2002|p=320}} Despite Himmler's interest in enacting such legislation, which he said would prevent "further intermingling of blood, and which regulates all the most pressing questions which go together with the existences of Gypsies in the living space of the German nation",{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=121}} the regime never promulgated the "Gypsy Law".{{sfn|USHMM, "Sinti and Roma"}} In December 1942, Himmler ordered that all Roma were to be sent to Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}}

==="The Jewish problem"===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049500, Berlin, Aufmarsch der SA in Spandau.jpg|thumb|The SA had nearly three million members at the start of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}}]]
Disenchanted with the unfulfilled promise of the NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society, SA members were eager to lash out against the Jewish minority as a way of expressing their frustrations. A [[Gestapo]] report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the "[[Jewish problem]]&amp;nbsp;... from below that the government would then have to follow".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Assaults, vandalism, and [[boycotts]] against Jews, which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934, increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised at the highest levels of government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Most non-party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=341}} The Israeli historian [[Otto Dov Kulka]] argues that there was a disparity between the views of the ''[[Alte Kämpfer]]'' (longtime party members) and the general public, but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|pp=92–93}} The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}}

The Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] announced on 25 July that a law forbidding marriages between Jews and non-Jews would shortly be promulgated, and recommended that registrars should avoid issuing licenses for such marriages for the time being. The draft law also called for a ban on marriage for persons with hereditary illnesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=57–58}}

Dr. [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the Economics Minister and [[Reichsbank]] president, criticised the violent behaviour of the ''Alte Kämpfer'' and SA because of its negative impact on the economy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} The violence also had a negative impact on Germany's reputation in the international community.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} For these reasons, Hitler ordered a stop to "individual actions" against German Jews on 8 August 1935, and the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick threatened to take legal action against Party members who ignored the order.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} From Hitler's perspective, it was imperative to quickly bring in new antisemitic laws to appease the radical elements in the NSDAP who persisted in attempting to remove the Jews from German society by violent means.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} A conference of ministers was held on 20 August 1935 to discuss the question. Hitler argued against violent methods because of the damage being done to the economy, and insisted the matter must be settled through legislation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=343}} The focus of the new laws would be marriage laws to prevent "racial defilement", stripping Jews of their German citizenship, and laws to prevent Jews from participating freely in the economy.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}}

===Events at Nuremberg===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-505, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Grundstein Kongreßhalle.jpg|NSDAP dignitaries at the 1935 [[Nuremberg Rally]]|thumb|left]]

The seventh annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Rally]], held in Nuremberg from 10–16 September 1935, featured the only [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] session held outside Berlin during the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=45}} Hitler decided that the rally would be a good opportunity to introduce the long-awaited anti-Jewish laws.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} In a speech on 12 September, leading Nazi physician [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]] announced that the government would soon introduce a "law for the protection of German blood".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=344}} The next day, Hitler summoned the Reichstag to meet in session at Nuremberg on 15 September, the last day of the rally.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} Franz Albrecht Medicus and [[Bernhard Lösener]] of the Interior Ministry were summoned to Nuremberg and directed to start preparing a draft of a law forbidding sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The two men arrived on 14 September.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=344–345}} That evening, Hitler ordered them to also have ready by morning a draft of the Reich citizenship law.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}} Hitler found the initial drafts of the Blood Law to be too lenient, so at around midnight Frick brought him four new drafts that differed mainly in the severity of the penalties they imposed. Hitler chose the most lenient version, but left vague the definition of who was a Jew.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=345–346}} Hitler stated at the rally that the laws were "an attempt at the legal settlement of a problem, which, if this proved a failure, would have to be entrusted by law to the National Socialist Party for a definitive solution".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=60}} Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] had the radio broadcast of the passing of the laws cut short, and ordered the German media to not mention them until a decision was made as to how they would be implemented.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=225}}

The two Nuremberg Laws were unanimously passed by the Reichstag on 15 September 1935.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour prohibited marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between Jews and Germans, and forbade the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households. The Reich Citizenship Law declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=345}} The wording in the Citizenship Law that a person must prove "by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich" meant that political opponents could also be stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} This law was effectively a means of stripping Jews, Roma, and other "undesirables" of their legal rights, and their citizenship.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=94}}

Over the coming years, an additional 13 supplementary laws were promulgated that further marginalised the Jewish community in Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} For example, Jewish families were not permitted to submit claims for subsidies for large families and were forbidden to transact business with Aryans.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=84}}

===Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour===
Moved by the understanding that purity of German blood is the essential condition for the continued existence of the German people, and inspired by the inflexible determination to ensure the existence of the German nation for all time, the Reichstag has unanimously adopted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 2
Extramarital relations between Jews and citizens of German or related blood are forbidden.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 3
Jews may not employ in their households female citizens of German or related blood who are under 45 years old.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

# Any person violating the provisions under Articles 3 or 4 will be punished with prison with hard labour for up to one year and a fine, or with one or the other of these penalties.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 6
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer and the Reich Minister of Justice, will issue the legal and administrative regulations required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 7
The law takes effect on the day following promulgation, except for Article 3, which goes into force on 1 January 1936.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

===Reich Citizenship Law===

The Reichstag has unanimously enacted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 1
# A subject of the state is a person who enjoys the protection of the German Reich and who in consequence has specific obligations toward it.
# The status of subject of the state is acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Reich and the Reich Citizenship Law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 2
# A Reich citizen is a subject of the state who is of German or related blood, and proves by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich.
# Reich citizenship is acquired through the granting of a Reich citizenship certificate.
# The Reich citizen is the sole bearer of full political rights in accordance with the law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 3
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer, will issue the legal and administrative orders required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

[[File:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|left|thumb|1935 chart shows racial classifications under the Nuremberg Laws: German, ''[[Mischling]]e'', and Jew.]]

While both the Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons with three or more Jewish grandparents would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (''[[Mischling]]e'' of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as to the status of persons with two Jewish grandparents (''Mischlinge'' of the first degree).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=49}} The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to ''Mischlinge'' of both the first and second degree.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}} For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=347}} The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did not have the right to vote.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the [[Anschluss]].{{sfn|Milton|2001|p=216}} Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}}

While Frick's suggestion that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would have to prove that they were Aryan was not acted upon, proving one's racial heritage became a necessary part of daily life.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}}{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=52}} Non-government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an [[Aryan paragraph]] excluding both ''Mischlinge'' and Jews from employment.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an [[Aryan certificate]]. One form was to acquire an ''[[Ahnenpass]]'', which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent.{{sfn|Ehrenreich|2007|p=68}} The ''Ahnenpass'' could also be acquired by citizens of other countries, as long as they were of "German or related blood".{{sfn|Scheil|2012}}

Under the ''Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour'' (15 September 1935), marriages were forbidden between Jews and Germans; between ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree and Germans; between Jews and ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree; and between two ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree. ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree were permitted to marry Jews, but they would henceforth be classed as Jewish themselves. All marriages undertaken between half-Jews and Germans required the approval of a Committee for the Protection of German Blood. Few such permissions were granted.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} A supplementary decree issued on 26 November 1935 extended the law to "Gypsies, Negroes, and their bastards".{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99993, Jude mit Stern in Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Beginning in 1941, Jews were required by law to self-identify by wearing a [[yellow badge]] on their clothing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=217}}]]

Persons suspected of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=540}} Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow the death penalty for some cases.{{sfn|Majer|2003|pp=331–332}} From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of ''Rassenschande''. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}}

For the most part, Germans accepted the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, but also because to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=180}} Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=172}} Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=548, 553}} Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors.{{sfn|Gellately|1991|p=105}} The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin that August.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}

The Interior Ministry estimated there were 750,000 ''Mischlinge'' as of April 1935 (studies done after the war put the number of ''Mischlinge'' at around 200,000).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} As Jews became more and more excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=55}} Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=65–66}} Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=86}}

Although a stated goal of the Nazis was that all Jews should leave the country, emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=64, 66}} Anyone caught transferring their money overseas were sentenced to lengthy terms in prison as "economic saboteurs".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=66}} An exception was money sent to Palestine under the terms of the [[Haavara Agreement]], whereby Jews could transfer some of their assets and emigrate to that country. Around 52,000 Jews emigrated to Palestine under the terms of this agreement between 1933 and 1939.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=556–557}}

By the start of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}} By 1938 it was becoming almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=67}} After the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]], the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=57}} Nationalistic and [[xenophobic]] people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=560, 601}} The [[Madagascar Plan]], a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=162–164}} Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=159–160}} The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting [[Holocaust]] is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Estimates of the death toll of Romanis in the [[Porajmos]] range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.{{sfn|Hancock|2012|p=381}}

==Existing copies==
An original typescript of the laws signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's [[Counterintelligence Corps]] in 1945. It ended up in the possession of General [[George S. Patton]], who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should be turned over to the government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the [[Huntington Library]], where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the [[Skirball Cultural Center]], which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in Washington in August 2010.{{sfn|Allen|2010}}{{sfn|Bradsher|2010}}

'''Official statistics''' are [[statistics]] published by [[Government|government agencies]] or other public bodies such as international organizations as a [[public good]]. They provide quantitative or qualitative information on all major areas of citizens' lives, such as economic and social development,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Economic and development statistics" http://www.un.org/esa/progareas/stats.html&lt;/ref&gt; living conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat-"Comparative EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions: Issues and Challenges" http://www.stat.fi/eusilc/index_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[health]],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "World Health Statistics 2008". http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. "Global Education Digest 2007". http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=7167_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC&lt;/ref&gt; and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Statistical Commission. "Environment statistics" http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/stacom_archive/brochures/for%20web/Brochure%20-%20Environment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, statistics were a method for counting and listing populations and State resources. The term ''statistics'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''statisticum collegium'' (council of state) and refers to ''science of the state''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ball|first1 = Philip|title = Critical Mass|publisher =  Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year = 2004|isbn=0-374-53041-6|page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], official statistics are statistics disseminated by the national statistical system, excepting those that are explicitly not to be official".&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Online Glossary of Statistical Terms http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental agencies at all levels, including municipal, [[county]], and state administrations, may generate and disseminate official statistics.  This broader possibility is accommodated by later definitions. For example:
{{quote|Almost every country in the world has one or more government agencies (usually national institutes) that supply decision-makers and other users including the general public and the research community with a continuing flow of information (...). This bulk of data is usually called official statistics. Official statistics should be objective and easily accessible and produced on a continuing basis so that measurement of change is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Biemer, Paul and Lyberg Lars (2003).''Introduction to Survey Quality'', Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-19375-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Official statistics result from the ''collection and processing of data'' into statistical information by a government institution or international organisation. They are then disseminated to help users develop their knowledge about a particular topic or geographical area, make comparisons between countries or understand changes over time. Official statistics make information on economic and social development accessible to the public, allowing the impact of government policies to be assessed, thus improving accountability.

==Aim==
Official statistics provide a picture of a country or different phenomena through data, and images such as [[chart|graph]] and [[map]]s. Statistical information covers different subject areas ([[economic]], [[demographic]], [[social]] etc.). It provides basic information for [[decision making]], evaluations and assessments at different levels.

The goal of statistical organizations is to produce relevant, objective and accurate&lt;ref&gt;See Point 3 in Assessment of the quality in statistics - Eurostat
http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2000/11/metis/crp.2.e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; statistics to keep users well informed and assist good policy and decision-making.

==Various categories==
''The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics'' were adopted in 1992 by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], and subsequently endorsed as a global standard by the United Nations Statistical Commission.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first Principle "Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics http://www.unece.org/stats/archive/docs.fp.e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The categorization of the domains of official statistics has been further developed in the Classification of Statistical Activities, endorsed by the Conference of European Statisticians and various other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/disaarchive/Classification+of+Statistical+Activities Classification of Statistical Activities]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most common indicators used in official statistics==
Statistical indicators provide an overview of the social, demographic and economic structure of society. Moreover, these indicators facilitate comparisons between countries and regions.

For '''population''', the main indicators are:
* Total population
* Population density
* Population by age
* [[Life expectancy]] at birth and at age 65
* [[Foreign born]]
* Foreigners in population
* [[Total fertility rate]]

In the '''employment''' category:
* [[Employment rate]]
* [[Unemployment rate]]
* Youth unemployment rate

* Total energy consumption
* Primary energy sources
* Energy consumption in transport
* Electricity consumption
* Consumption of renewable energy sources

==Users==
[[File:User Types.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The three user types of official statistics]]
Official statistics are intended for a wide range of users including governments (central and local), research institutions, professional statisticians, journalists and the media, businesses, educational institutions and the general public.
There are '''three types of users''': those with a general interest, business interest or research interest. Each of these user groups has different needs for statistical information.

===Users with a general interest===
'''''Users with a general interest''''' include the media, schools and the general public. They use official statistics in order to be informed on a particular topic, to observe trends within the society of a local area, country, region of the world.

===Users with a business interest===
'''''Users with a business interest''''' include decision makers and users with a particular interest for which they want more detailed information. For them, official statistics are an important reference, providing information on the phenomena or circumstances their own work is focusing on. For instance, those users will take some official statistics into consideration before launching a product, or deciding on a specific policy or on a [[marketing strategy]]. As with the business interest users, this group does not usually have a good understanding of statistical methodologies, but they need more detailed information than the general users.

===Users with a research interest===
'''''Users with a research interest''''' are universities, consultants and [[government agencies]]. They generally understand something about statistical methodology and want to dig deeper into the facts and the statistical observations; they have an analytical purpose in inventing or explaining interrelations of causes and effects of different phenomena. In this field, official statistics are also used to assess a government's policies.

One common point for all these users is their need to be able to '''trust''' the official information. They need to be confident that the results published are authoritative and unbiased. Producers of official statistics must maintain a reputation of professionalism and independence.

The statistical system must be free from interference that could influence decisions on the choice of sources, methods used for '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data collection]''', the selection of results to be released as official, and the timing and form of '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc dissemination]'''. Statistical business processes should be transparent and follow [[international standards]] of good practice.

Statistical programs are decided on an annual or multi-annual basis by governments in many countries. They also provide a way to judge the performance of the statistical system.

==Producers at the national level==
{{see also|List of national and international statistical services}}

Official statistics are collected and produced by '''national statistical organisations''' (NSOs), or other organisations (e.g. central banks) that form part of the national statistical system in countries where statistical production is de-centralized. These organisations are responsible for producing and disseminating official statistical information, providing the highest quality data. Quality in the context of official statistics is a multi-faceted concept, consisting of components such as relevance, completeness, timeliness, accuracy, accessibility, clarity, cost-efficiency, transparency, comparability and coherence.

The core tasks of NSOs, for both centralized and decentralized systems, are determining user needs and filtering these for [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=relevance relevance]. Then they transform the relevant user needs into measurable concepts to facilitate data collection and dissemination. The NSO is in charge of the coordination between statistical producers and of ensuring the coherence and compliance of the statistical system to agreed standards. The NSO has a coordination responsibility as its President/Director General represents the entire national system of official statistics, both at the national and at international levels.

==Production process==
The production process of official statistics comprises 9 phases, as documented in the [http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/metis/The+Generic+Statistical+Business+Process+Model Generic Statistical Business Process Model]
* Specify Needs
* Design
* Build
* Collect
* Process
* Analyse
* Disseminate
* Archive
* Evaluate

==Data revision==
Even after they have been published, some official statistics may be revised. Policy-makers may need preliminary statistics quickly for decision-making purposes, but eventually it is important to publish the best available information, so official statistics are often published in several 'vintages'.

In order to understand the accuracy of economic data and the possible impact of data errors on macroeconomic decision-making, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] has published a dataset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/real-time-data/|title=Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists|work=philadelphiafed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; that records both initial real-time data estimates, and subsequent data revisions, for a large number of macroeconomic series. A similar dataset for Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabcn.org/eabcn-real-time-database|title=EABCN Real Time Database|work=eabcn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by the Euro-Area Business Cycle Network.

==Data Sources==
There are two sources of data for statistics. Primary, or "statistical" sources are data that are collected primarily for creating official statistics, and include statistical surveys and censuses. Secondary, or "non-statistical" sources, are data that have been primarily collected for some other purpose (administrative data, private sector data etc.).

===Statistical survey or sample survey===
A [[statistical survey]] or a [[sample survey]] is an investigation about the characteristics of a phenomenon by means of collecting data from a sample of the population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology.
** The main advantages are the direct control over data collection and the possibility to ask for data according to statistical definitions.
** Disadvantages include the high cost of data collection and the quality issues relating to [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc non-response] and survey errors.

There are various survey methods that can be used such as direct interviewing, telephone, mail, online surveys.

===Census===
A [[census]] is a complete enumeration of a population or groups at a point in time with respect to well-defined characteristics (population, production). Data are collected for a specific reference period. A [http://www.unece.org/stats/census/ census should be taken at regular intervals] in order to have comparable information available, therefore, most statistical censuses are conducted every 5 or 10 years. Data are usually collected through [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=questionnaire questionnaires] mailed to respondents, via the Internet, or completed by an [http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3029 enumerator] visiting respondents, or contacting them by telephone.
** An advantage is that censuses provide better data than surveys for small geographic areas or sub-groups of the population. Census data can also provide a basis for sampling frames used in subsequent surveys.
** The major disadvantage of censuses is usually the high cost associated with planning and conducting them, and processing the resulting data.

In 2005, the [https://www.un.org/ecosoc/ United Nations Economic and Social Council] adopted a resolution urging: "Member States to carry out a population and housing census and to disseminate census results as an essential source of information for small area, national, regional and international planning and development; and to provide census results to national stakeholders as well as the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations to assist in studies on population, environment, and socio-economic development issues and programs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/13, 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/docs/resolution_A_2005_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Register===
A register is a database that is updated continuously for a specific purpose and from which statistics can be collected and produced. It contains information on a complete group of units.
** An advantage is the ''total coverage'' even if collecting and processing represent ''low cost''. It allows producing more detailed statistics than using surveys. Different registers can be combined and linked together on the basis of defined keys (personal identification codes, business identification codes, address codes etc.). Moreover, individual administrative registers are usually of high quality and very detailed.
** A disadvantage is the ''possible under-coverage'' that can be the case if the incentive or the cultural tradition of registering events and changes are weak, if the classification principles of the register are not clearly defined or if the classifications do not correspond to the needs of statistical production to be derived from them.

There are different types of registers:

→'''''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc Administrative registers]'''''&lt;ref&gt;See Using a combination of administrative registers and sample surveys instead of
a census: dome general remarks and the situation in the Netherlands, A.H. Kroese
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb/attachments/2001NLD_Registers-
GUIDf2d2b48e535a481bb84b6b817a397066.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''records''''' can help the NSI in collecting data. Using the existing administrative data for statistical production may be approved by the public because it can be seen as a cost efficient method; individuals and enterprises are less harassed by a response burden; [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=data+security data security] is better as fewer people handle it and data have an electronic format.

→'''''Private registers''''' such as registers operated by insurance companies and employer organizations can also be used in the production process of official statistics, providing there is an agreement or legislation on this.

→'''''Statistical registers''''' are frequently based on combined data from different administrative registers or other data sources.

→For businesses, it is often legally indispensable to be registered in their country to a '''''business register''''' which is a system that makes business information collection easier.

→It is possible to find ''''' agricultural registers''''' and '''''registers of dwellings'''''.

Even though different types of data collection exist, the best estimates are based on a combination of different sources providing the strengths and reducing the weakness of each individual source.

==Official Statistics presentation==
Official statistics can be presented in different ways. Analytical texts and tables are the most traditional ways. '''Graphs''' and '''[[charts]]''' summarize data highlighting information content visually. They can be extremely effective in expressing key results, or illustrating a presentation. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Graphs and charts usually have a heading describing the topic.

There are different types of graphic but usually the data determine the type that is going to be used.
* To illustrate changes over time, a '''''[[line graph]]''''' would be recommended. This is usually used to display variables whose values represent a regular progression.
[[File:ECE_weekly_235.png|thumb|right|200px|Stacked bar chart showing the sectoral contribution to total business services growth, 2001-2005 for members of [[UNECE]].]]
* For categorical data, it is better to use a '''''[[bar graph]]''''' either vertical or horizontal. They are often used to represent percentages and rates and also to compare countries, groups or illustrate changes over time. The same variable can be plotted against itself for two groups. An example of this is the age pyramid.
* '''''[[Pie chart]]''''' can be used to represent share of 100 per cent. Pie charts highlight the topic well only when there are few segments.
* '''''[[Stacked bar chart]]s''''', whether vertical or horizontal, are used to compare compositions across categories. They can be used to compare percentage composition and are most effective for categories that add up to 100 per cent, which make a full stacked bar chart. Their use is usually restricted to a small number of categories.
* '''''Tables''''' are a complement to related texts and support the analysis. They help to minimize numbers in the description and also eliminate the need to discuss small variables that are not essential. Tables rank data by order or other hierarchies to make the numbers easily understandable. They usually show the figures from the highest to the lowest.
* Another type of visual presentation of statistical information is '''''[[thematic map]]'''''. They can be used to illustrate differences or similarities between geographical areas, regions or countries. The most common statistical map that is used is called the [[choropleth map]] where different shades of a colour are used to highlight contrasts between regions; darker colour means a greater statistical value. This type of map is best used for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16571685&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=ratio&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 ratio]&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph 4.5 in Data and Metadata reporting and Presentation Handbook -
OECD
http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/17/37671574.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; data but for other data, proportional or graduated symbol maps, such as circles, are preferred. The size of the symbol increases in proportion to the value of the observed object.

==Release==
Official statistics are part of our everyday life. They are everywhere: in newspapers, on television and radio, in presentations and discussions. For most citizens, the media provide their only exposure to official statistics.
'''Television''' is the primary news source for citizens in industrialized countries, even if '''radio''' and newspapers still play an important role in the dissemination of statistical information. On the other hand, '''newspapers and specialized economic and social magazines''' can provide more detailed coverage of statistical releases as the information on a specific theme can be quite extensive. Official statistics provides us with important information on the situation and the development trends in our society.

Users can gather information making use of the services of the National Statistical Offices. They can easily find it on the '''agency's website'''.
The development of computing technologies and the Internet has enabled users - businesses, educational institutions and households among others- to have access to statistical information. The Internet has become an important tool for statistical producers to disseminate their data and information. People are able to access information online. The supply of information from statistical agencies has increased. Today the advanced agencies provide the information on their websites in an understandable way, often categorized for different groups of users.
Several glossaries have been set up by different organizations or statistical offices to provide more information and definitions in the field of statistics and consequently official statistics.

==Quality criteria to be respected==
The quality criteria of a national statistical office are the following: relevance, impartiality, dissemination, independence, transparency, confidentiality,  international standards {{citation needed|reason=This statement is too strong, particularly without citation, as there are many different quality standards. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics includes 'timeliness' and 'institutional environment', which are not present below or in others' data quality standards. cf OECD review of statistical data quality dimensions at http://www.oecd.org/std/na/34350524.pdf |date=October 2015}}. There principles apply not only to the NSO but to all producers of official statistics. Therefore, not every figure reported by a public body should be considered as official statistics, but those produced and disseminated according to the principles. Adherence to these principles will enhance the credibility of the NSO and other official statistical producers and build public trust in the reliability of the information and results that are produced.

===Relevance===
Relevance is the first and most important principles to be respected for national statistical offices. When releasing information, data and official statistics should be relevant in order to fulfil the needs of users as well as both public and private sector decision makers. Production of official statistics is relevant if it corresponds to different user needs like public, governments, businesses, research community, educational institutions, [[NGO]]s and international organizations or if it satisfies basic information in each area and citizen's right to information.

===Impartiality===
Once the survey has been made, the NSO checks the quality of the results and then they have to be disseminated no matter what impact they can have on some users, whether good or bad. All should accept the results released by the NSO as authoritative. Users need to perceive the results as unbiased representation of relevant aspects of the society. Moreover, the impartiality principle implies the fact that NSOs have to use understandable terminology for statistics' dissemination, [[questionnaires]] and material published so that everyone can have access to their information.

===Dissemination===
In order to maximize dissemination, statistics should be presented in a way that facilitates proper interpretation and meaningful comparisons. To reach the general public and non-expert users when disseminating, NSOs have to add explanatory comments to explain the significance of the results released and make analytical comments when necessary. There is a need to identify clearly what the preliminary, final and revised results are, in order to avoid confusion for users. All results of official statistics have to be publicly accessible. There are no results that should  be characterized as official and for the exclusive use of the government. Moreover, they should be disseminated simultaneously.

===Independence===
Users can be consulted by NSOs but the decisions should be made by statistical bodies. Information and activities of producers of official statistics should be independent of political control. Moreover, NSOs have to be free of any political interference that could influence their work and thus, the results. They should not make any political advice or policy-perspective comments on the results released at any time, even at [[press conferences]] or in interviews with the media.

===Transparency===
The need for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16635185&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=transparency&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 transparency] is essential for NSOs to gain the trust of the public. They have to expose to the public the methods they use to produce official statistics, and be accountable for all the decisions they take and the results they publish. Also, statistical producers should warn users of certain interpretations and false conclusions even if they try to be as precise as possible. Furthermore, the quality of the accurate and timely results must be assessed prior to release. But if errors in the results occur before or after the [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data revision],&lt;ref&gt;See Data Review/Data Checking in Glossary of Terms on Statistical Data Editing –
UNECE http://www.unece.org/stats/publications/editingglossary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; they should be directly corrected and information should be disseminated to the users at the earliest possible time. Producers of official statistics have to set analytical systems in order to change or improve their activities and methods.

===Confidentiality===
All data collected by the national statistical office must protect the privacy of individual respondents, whether persons or businesses. But on the contrary, government units such as institutions cannot invoke statistical confidentiality. All respondents have to be informed about the purpose and legal basis of the survey and especially about the confidentiality measures. The statistical office should not release any information that could identify an individual or group without prior consent. After data collection, replies should go back directly to the statistical producer, without involving any  intermediary. Data processing implies that filled-in paper and electronic form with full names should be destroyed.

===International standards===
The use of international standards at the national level aims to improve international comparability for national users and facilitate decision-making, especially when controversial. Moreover, the overall structure, including concepts and definitions, should follow internationally accepted standards, guidelines or good practices. International recommendations and standards for statistical methods approved by many countries provide them with a common basis like the two standards of the [[International Monetary Fund]], SDDS for '''Special Data Dissemination Standards''' and GDDS for '''General Data Dissemination System'''. Their aim is to guide countries in the dissemination of their economic and financial data to the public. Once approved, these standards have to be observed by all producers of official statistics and not only by the NSO.

{{distinguish|Police}}
A '''policy''' is a [[Deliberation|deliberate]] [[system]] of [[principle]]s to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Policy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Impact==

===Intended effects===
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the 
organization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Corporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Unintended effects===
Policies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing [[capital flight]] or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed. (See the [[Laffer curve]].) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Policy cycle==
In [[political science]], the '''policy cycle''' is a tool used for the analyzing of the development of a policy item. It can also be referred to as a "stagist approach", "stages heuristic" or "stages approach". It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how [[political science|political scientists]] looked at policy in general.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert T. Nakamura, THE TEXTBOOK POLICY PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH:
Review of Policy Research Volume 7, Issue 1, pages 142–154, September 1987
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00034.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a theory from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s work.

One version by James E. Anderson, in his ''Public Policy-Making'' (1974) has the following stages:
# [[Political agenda|Agenda]] setting (Problem identification) - The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention. 
# Policy Formulation - Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem. (appraisal, dialogue, formulation, and consolidation)
# Decision-making - Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it. (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action') 
# [[Implementation]] - The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
# [[Evaluation]] - Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results. [[Actor (policy debate)|Policy actors]] attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.

An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in ''The Australian Policy Handbook'' by Peter Bridgman and [[Glyn Davis]]: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

# Issue identification
# [[Policy analysis]]
# [[Public consultation|Consultation]] (which permeates the entire process)
# Policy instrument development
# Building coordination and coalitions
# Program Design: [[Decision theory|Decision]] making
# Policy [[Implementation]]
# Policy [[Evaluation]]

The Althaus, Bridgman &amp; Davis model is [[heuristic]] and [[iterative]]. It is {{clarify|text=intentionally [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]]|date=February 2016}} and not meant to be {{clarify|text=[[Organizational diagnostics|diagnostic]]|date=February 2016}} or [[predictive]]. Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers. Accordingly, some [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [https://www.odi.org/publications/1127-become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes [[Voluntary sector|civil society organisations]], the [[Mass media|media]], [[intellectuals]], [[think tanks]] or policy [[research institutes]], corporations, [[Advocacy group|lobbyists]], etc.

==Content==
Policies are typically [[promulgation|promulgated]] through official written documents. Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force. Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including '''{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}''' :
* A '''purpose statement''', outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.
* An '''applicability and scope''' statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements.  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.
* An '''effective date''' which indicates when the policy comes into force.  [[Ex post facto law|Retroactive policies]] are rare, but can be found.
* A '''responsibilities''' section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements.  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions.  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant [[Regulation|oversight]] and/or [[governance]] structures.
* '''Policy statements''' indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating.  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.

Some policies may contain additional sections, including:
* '''Background''', indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as '''motivating factors'''.  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.
* '''Definitions''', providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.
 {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Typologies==
The American political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] proposed four types of policy, namely '''distributive''', '''redistributive''', '''regulatory''' and '''constituent''' in his article 'Four systems of Policy, Politics and Choice' and in 'American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory'.
Policy addresses the [[intent]] of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary. Policy is intended to affect the 'real' world, by guiding the decisions that are made. Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://perguntasaopo.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lowi_1972_four-systems-of-policy-politics-and-choice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies may be classified in many different ways. The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Distributive policies===
[[Distributive tendency|Distributive policies]] extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization. Examples include government policies that impact spending for [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[public education]], [[highways]], and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Regulatory policies===
Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior. These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions. An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Constituent policies===
Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws. Constituent policies also deal with Fiscal Policy in some circumstances.{{Citation needed|reason=As well as the governing board creates laws
Noman Dhakkn|date=February 2010}}

===Redistributive policies===
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws. Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results. Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

When the term policy is used, it may also refer to:{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}
* Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
* Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
* A company or organization's policy on a particular topic.  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.

The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by [[Horse trading|political compromise]] over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Types of [[policy analysis]] include: &lt;!-- explain them!--&gt;

* Causal (resp. non-causal)
* Deterministic (resp. stochastic, randomized and sometimes non-deterministic)
* Index
* Memoryless (''e.g.'', non-stationary)
* Opportunistic (resp. non-opportunistic)
* Stationary (resp. non-stationary)

These qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy.

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[enterprise architecture]] for systems design, [[policy appliances]] are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in [[information systems]].
* In [[insurance]], policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] (protect) against potential loss from specified perils. While these documents are referred to as policies, they are in actuality a form of [[contract]] - see [[insurance contract]].
* In [[gambling]], policy is a form of an unsanctioned lottery, where players purport to purchase ''[[insurance]]'' against a chosen number being picked by a legitimate [[lottery]]. Or can refer to an ordinary [[Numbers game]]
* In [[artificial intelligence]] planning &lt;!-- as in artificial intelligence? unclear--&gt; and ''reinforcement learning'', a policy prescribes a non-empty deliberation (sequence of actions) given a non-empty sequence of states.
* In [[debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate]], the term "policy" is slang for [[policy debate|policy or cross-examination]] debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">'''Post-behavioralism''' (or '''post-behaviouralism''') also known as '''neo-behavioralism''' (or '''neo-behaviouralism''') was a reaction against the dominance of [[behavioralism|behavioralist]] methods in the study of politics. One of the key figures in post-behaviouralist thinking was [[David Easton]] who was originally one of the leading advocates of the "behavioral revolution".&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Post-behavioralists claimed that despite the alleged value-neutrality of behavioralist research it was biased towards the status quo and social preservation rather than social change.

==Key tenets==
*Post-behavioralism challenged the idea that academic research had to be value neutral&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Schram, Brian Caterino, (2006)  ''Making political science matter: debating knowledge, research, and method'', New York: New York University Press, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that values should not be neglected.&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-behavioralism claimed that behavioralism's bias towards observable and measurable phenomena meant that too much emphasis was being placed on easily studied trivial issues at the expense of more important topics.&lt;ref&gt;Jay M. Shafritz (2004) ''Dictionary of public policy and administration'', Oxford: Westview Press, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research should be more relevant to society&lt;ref&gt;Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and intellectuals have a positive role to play in society.&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Heinz Eulau described post-behavioralism as a "near hysterical response to political frustrations engendered by the disconcerting and shocking events of the late sixties and early seventies".&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, Heinz (1981). "Foreword: On Revolutions That Never Were." In S. L.. Long (ed.), ''The Handbook of Political Behavior''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''provisional government''', also called a '''morning ''' or '''transitional''' [[government]], is an emergency governmental authority set up to manage a political transition, generally in the cases of new nations or following the collapse of the previous governing administration. Provisional governments are generally appointed, and frequently arise, either during or after [[civil war|civil]] or foreign wars.

Provisional governments maintain power until a new government can be appointed by a regular political process, which is generally an [[election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/acbgovtpol/caretaker_government|title = caretaker government|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = Credo Reference|publisher = Dictionary of politics and government|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be involved with defining the legal structure of subsequent regimes, guidelines related to [[human rights]] and [[political freedom]]s, the structure of the [[economy]], government institutions, and international alignment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Role of Interim Governments|last = Shain(1) Linz(2)|first = Yossi(1) Linz(2)|date = January 1992|journal = Journal of Democracy|doi = 10.1353/jod.1992.0012|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisional governments differ from [[caretaker government]]s, which are responsible for governing within an established parliamentary system and serve as placeholders following a [[motion of no confidence]],  or following the dissolution of the ruling coalition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In opinion of Yossi Shain and Juan J. Linz, provisional governments can be classified to four groups:&lt;ref name="ShainLinz_BetweenStates_1995_5psl"&gt;Yossi Shain, Juan J. Linz, "Between States: Interim Governments in Democratic Transitions", 1995, {{ISBN|9780521484985}} [https://books.google.lt/books?hl=lt&amp;lr=&amp;id=uy2GQmasDg4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

# Revolutionary provisional governments (when the former regime is overthrown and the power belongs to the ones who have overthrown it).
# Power sharing provisional governments (when the power is shared between former regime and the ones who are trying to change it).
# Incumbent provisional governments (when the power during transitional period belongs to the former regime).
# International provisional governments (when the power during the transitional period belongs to the international community).

The establishment of provisional governments is frequently tied to the implementation of [[transitional justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Transitional Justice and the Rule of Law|last = McAuliffe|first = Padraig|date = 09/01/2010|journal = ague Journal of the Rule of Law|doi = 10.1017/S1876404510200015|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions related to transitional justice can determine who is allowed to participate in a provisional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = udicial Independence, Transitional Justice and the Rule of Law|last = Dyzenhaus|first = David|date = 2001–2004|journal = Otago Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early provisional governments were created to prepare for the return of royal rule. Irregularly convened assemblies during the [[English Revolution]], such as [[Confederate Ireland]] (1641–49), were described as "provisional". The [[Continental Congress]], a convention of delegates from [[Thirteen Colonies|13 British colonies]] on the east coast of North America became the provisional government of the [[United States]] in 1776, during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The government shed its provisional status in 1781, following ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation]], and continued until it was supplanted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1789.

The practice of using "provisional government" as part of a formal name can be traced to [[Talleyrand]]'s government in France in 1814. In 1843, [[American pioneer]]s in the [[Oregon Country]], in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America established the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]—as the U.S. federal government had not yet extend its jurisdiction over the region—which existed until March 1849. The numerous provisional governments during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal government established to prepare for elections.

{{Gaza blockade}}
'''Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid''' on 31 May 2010 ranged from fierce condemnation to strong support for Israel.

Israel expressed regret over loss of life in the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], yet stated that the operation was a "clear case of self defense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/Spokesman/2010/06/spokehatshara010610.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605042336/http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/Spokesman/2010/06/spokehatshara010610.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 June 2010 |title=Statement by PM Netanyahu Regarding Flotilla to Gaza |publisher=Prime Minister's Office, Israel |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologised for the incident in March 2013, which he said was necessitated by the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Herb Keinon |date=24 March 2013 |title='Syria crisis necessitated Turkey apology' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Syria-crisis-necessitated-Turkey-apology-307535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also drew attention to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, which was condemned.&lt;ref name="NYT Gaza-Bound"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bronner|first=Ethan|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Israeli Military Boards Gaza-Bound Aid Ship|date=5 June 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/world/middleeast/06flotilla.html|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] called for a full investigation and urged Israel to provide a full explanation.

The Turkish government and the İHH were also criticised.

=== International Human Rights and advocacy organizations ===
* [[Amnesty International]] accused Israel of using excessive force, and claimed that the level of lethal force used was out of proportion to any threat that could have been posed by the activists. Amnesty International called on Israel to make public the rules of engagement used by the commandos, and to launch an "immediate, credible and independent investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/israeli-killings-gaza-ship-activists-must-be-investigated-2010-05-31 |title=Israeli killings of Gaza ship activists must be investigated |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International also called for an international inquiry, and called on Israel to invite UN experts to examine the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/israeli-authorities-urged-commission-international-inquiry-2010-06-10 |title=Working to Protect Human Rights |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Foreign Press Association]], which represents hundreds of journalists in Israel and the Palestinian territories, has complained the Israeli military seized video and equipment from dozens of reporters on board the main ship. The FPA says the military is now selectively using footage to bolster its claims that commandos opened fire only after being attacked. FPA also criticized Israel's use of captured material without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Amy Teibel |date=4 June 2010 |publisher=Associated Press |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD9G3RA283 |title=Israel's use of captured video draws criticism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606040028/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD9G3RA283|archivedate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human Rights Watch]] called for a "full, impartial investigation" into the incident, and for the international community to make sure that any inquiries meet basic international standards, and that any wrongdoers were brought to justice. Human Rights Watch also called on Israel to grant all detained and injured flotilla members immediate access to legal counsel and their families, and to disclose the identities of all those injured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/31/israel-full-impartial-investigation-flotilla-killings-essential |title=Israel: Full, Impartial Investigation of Flotilla Killings Essential |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reporters Without Borders]] called for the release of the names of all journalists held after the raid.

The journalists who were on the flotilla to cover the humanitarian operation were put in harm's way by this disproportionate reaction. We urge the Israeli authorities to release the detained journalists and allow them unrestricted access to the Gaza Strip.

* [[Stop the War Coalition]] issued a statement saying "The action should see Israel condemned under international law. Israel has repeatedly flouted law and public opinion worldwide in its treatment of the Palestinians. The decision by Israel to attack the flotilla with such loss of human life shows it is arrogant and deadly intent in opposing any aid to the Palestinians."&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt;
* The President of the Algerian [[Movement of Society for Peace|MSP]] [[Bouguerra Soltani]], whose wife is part of the delegation, announced the dispatch of a parliamentary delegation to Turkey to try to get information about the 32 Algerians aboard the convoy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/4038.html "Flotilla to Ghaza: Arab anger against Israel"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023137/http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/4038.html# |date=26 July 2011 }}, Ennahar Online, 1 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Al-Aqsa TV, Imam Ahmad Ibrahimi, the Coordinator of Algerian Delegation to Flotilla, stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), "we felt no fear whatsoever of those brothers of apes and pigs. By Allah, I loathed them before, and my hatred of them has only grown, not because they punished and humiliated us, but because I had thought them to be worthy enemies, but it turns out that they are too despicable even to be called our enemies, because they are not our equals. They are cowards ... Our hatred for these people is so intense that we wished, at those moments, that we could have been bombs, and blow up among those brothers of apes and pigs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2504.htm "MEMRI Flotilla Coverage: Imam Ahmad Ibrahimi, Coordinator of Algerian Delegation to 'Freedom Flotilla': Our Hatred of Them Is So Intense That We Wished We Could Have Been Bombs and Blown Ourselves Up among the Brothers of Apes and Pigs"], [[Middle East Media Research Institute]], Clip 2504, 4 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli and Jewish organizations ===
The [[Australian Jewish Democratic Society]] said, "Unless the Israeli government can convincingly back up its claims that the Gaza aid convoy was not a project for delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, but in reality a front for violent action, it invites the condemnation of everyone who supports negotiated conflict resolution and reinforces the view that Israel's professed support for human rights is a sham."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajds.org.au/node/256 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605192452/http://ajds.org.au/node/256 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 June 2010 |title=AJDS Statement on Israeli action against the Gaza Convoy |publisher=Australian Jewish Democratic Society |date= |accessdate=2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B'Tselem]] demanded that an independent and effective investigation conducted by non-military officials be launched immediately. B'Tselem stated that among the issues that needed investigating are whether proportionate force was used, whether the soldiers were trained and equipped to cope with this type of event, what open-fire regulations were given to soldiers, and whether alternative options were considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20100531.asp |date=31 May 2010 |title=Open an immediate investigation into the action to gain control of the flotilla to Gaza |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]] said, "Jews For Justice For Palestinians (the largest alternative voice of Jews in the UK or Europe) utterly condemns Israel's aggressive military interception of the peaceful Free Gaza aid flotilla. We hold Israel responsible for the tragic deaths and injuries which this action caused."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfjfp.com/?p=13408 "JfJfP statement on the flotilla interception"] [[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]].

German Jewish group [[Jewish Voices for a Just Peace]] decided to send a boat with school supplies and humanitarian aid to break the [[Gaza blockade]]. Kate Katzenstein-Leiterer, a leader of the group, said instead that they wanted to help preserve the State of Israel by showing that its current policies were wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=DPA |title=Organizer of German Jewish Flotilla: We Aren't Betraying Israel |date=17 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/organizer-of-german-jewish-flotilla-we-aren-t-betraying-israel-1.296724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to excessive interest, the group subsequently decided to arrange a second vessel.&lt;ref name="German Jews Inundated"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Deutsche Presse Agentur|title=German Jews 'inundated' with requests to join new Gaza aid flotilla |date=14 June 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/german-jews-inundated-with-requests-to-join-new-gaza-aid-flotilla-1.296146 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Dovid Feldman of [[Neturei Karta]] said: "Authentic [[Orthodox Jew]]ry worldwide decries unequivocally the cold-blooded slaughter carried out by the Zionist occupational forces against innocent, peaceful and freedom-loving noble activists committed to peace and human rights. This brutal attack took place in international waters on ships bearing humanitarian aid for our brethren, the Palestinian residents in the besieged Gaza Strip. It was an explicitly illegal act which breaches, in a serious manner, basic G-dly human rights, justice and law. This kind of behavior is, unfortunately, only to be expected from the Zionists. Their state's entire existence was built from the very start on Heresy, robbery and murder. They oppressed, murdered and expelled an entire people from its land." Adding, "We find it imperative to clearly declare that the State of 'Israel' does not represent the Jewish people, and certainly not the Jewish religion. They have no right to speak in our name, nor in the name of the holy Torah. They profane the Holy Land with their abominations, slaughters and countless other actions that emanate from this illegitimate State. Furthermore, the actual existence of this State is illegitimate as the holy Torah strictly and explicitly forbids any Jewish rule over the Holy Land." Neturei Karta protests took place in Ottawa, Montral, Washington, D.C., New York City, Jerusalem and London. Neturei Karta Rabbis visited the injured in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/activities/Press/20100603Flotilla.cfm "Neturei Karta Condemns Israeli Attack on Flotilla"]. [[Neturei Karta]].

===Polls===

A [[Rasmussen Reports]] national telephone poll in the United States of 1000 voters found that 49% of respondents blame pro-Palestinian activists on the Gaza bound aid ships for the deaths that resulted. 19% blamed Israel and 32% were not sure. 51% of those polled thought that Israel should allow an international investigation into the incident, while 25% agreed with Israel's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/israel_the_middle_east/49_say_pro_palestinian_activists_to_blame_in_gaza_ship_incident "49% Say Pro-Palestinian Activists To Blame in Gaza Ship Incident"] – [[Rasmussen Reports]] (7 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Yougov]] survey found that 55% of the Britons polled believed Israel had overreacted, 27% didn't know and 18% thought they'd acted in self-defence. When asked about an international investigation, an overwhelming 74% believed it should be conducted by an international group. 4% thought it should be led by Israel, 12% didn't know, and 11% thought an inquiry shouldn't be held as it was a distraction from peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-Israel-010610.pdf "Survey Report"].

=== Flotilla movement ===

Jewish Voices for a Just Peace, a group of German Jews belonging to the [[European Jews for a Just Peace]] that plans to send a boat with humanitarian aid to break the Gaza blockade, has received a large number of request to travel with the ship, and is searching for a second vessel to accommodate additional participants.&lt;ref name="German Jews Inundated"/&gt;

==Result of international actions==&lt;!--could move this to the main page--&gt;

===United Nations Security Council===
The [[United Nations Security Council]] convened an emergency meeting at the request of Turkey, during which the [[Ahmet Davutoglu|Turkish foreign minister]] stated "Israel must be held accountable for its crimes" (prior to the meeting, the [[Riyad Mansour|Palestinian ambassador to the UN]] called for an independent Security Council investigation). While the [[Mark Lyall Grant|British ambassador]] said Israel should end the Gaza blockade and take steps for an investigation, the [[Alejandro Wolff|US deputy permanent representative]] supported the Israeli position that humanitarian aid should have gone by "accepted international mechanisms", and the [[Daniel Carmon|Israeli deputy permanent representative]] said the flotilla was not humanitarian but had a mission of breaking the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/31/un.security.council.gaza/index.html?hpt=T1 "U.N. Security Council meets on Israeli raid"] 1 June 2010, [[CNN]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--also said some were terrorists on board, can include that in the israeli response--&gt;

The United States directly intervened to prevent the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s statement, which requested an "impartial" investigation of the deaths and condemned those "acts" that led to it, from resembling that drafted by Turkey, the Palestinians and Arab states, which called for condemnation "in the strongest terms" and an independent international inquiry.&lt;ref name="Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Naughton, Philippe |author2=Evans, Judith |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 June 2010|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7141783.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 hours of negotiations were required to come up with a statement that suited all.&lt;ref name="Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid"/&gt;

As a result of the emergency meeting that went into the early hours of the morning, the council agreed condemn the acts that resulted in the deaths and injuries aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''. They also called for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. This was different from what Turkey and the Arab states were demanded – an independent international investigation—leaving open the possibility of who would conduct the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/europe/UN-Security-Council-Calls-for-Impartial-Credible-Investigation-of-Israeli-Boat-Raid-95297034.html |title=UN Security Council Calls for Impartial, Credible Investigation of Israeli Boat Raid |publisher=[[Voice of America News]] |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-06-01-un-israel-censure_N.htm |title=U.N. condemns Israeli flotilla raid, calls for investigation |work=[[USA Today]] |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTUNSC&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/world/middleeast/02nations.html "U.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15863">'''Regulatory competition''', also called '''competitive governance''' or '''policy competition''', is a phenomenon in [[law]], [[economics]] and [[politics]] concerning the desire of law makers to compete with one another in the kinds of law offered in order to attract businesses or other actors to operate in their jurisdiction. Regulatory competition depends upon the ability of actors such as companies, workers or other kinds of people to move between two or more separate legal systems. Once this is possible, then the temptation arises for the people running those different legal systems to compete to offer better terms than their "competitors" to attract investment. Historically, regulatory competition has operated within countries having federal systems of regulation - particularly the United States, but since the mid-20th century and the intensification of economic [[globalisation]], regulatory competition became an important issue internationally.

One opinion is that regulatory competition in fact creates a "race to the top" in standards, due to the ability of different actors to select the most efficient rules by which to be governed. The main fields of law affected by the phenomenon of regulatory competition are [[corporate law]], [[labour law]], [[tax]] and [[environmental law]]. Another opinion is that regulatory competition between jurisdictions creates a "[[race to the bottom]]" in standards, due to the decreased ability of any jurisdiction to enforce standards without the cost of driving investment abroad.

==History==
The concept of regulatory competition emerged from the late 19th and early 20th century experience with [[charter competition]] among US states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. In 1890 [[New Jersey]] enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower [[franchise tax]]es than other states. [[Delaware]] attempted to copy the law to attract companies to its own state. This competition ended when [[Woodrow Wilson]] as Governor tightened New Jersey's laws again through a series of seven statutes.

In academic literature the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by AA Berle and GC Means in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) while the concept received formal recognition by the [[US Supreme Court]] in a decision of Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] in the 1933 case ''[[Ligget Co. v. Lee]]''&lt;ref&gt;288 U.S. 517, 558-559 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Brandeis also coined the term “[[laboratories of democracy]]” in ''[[New State Ice Company v. Liebmann]]'',&lt;ref&gt;285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Federal government was capable of ending experiment.

===Corporate law===
{{See also|Corporate law}}
American corporate law scholars have debated on the role of the regulatory competition on corporate law for more than one decade. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1103644 A Comparative Bibliography]
In the United States legal academia, corporate law is conventionally said to be the product of a "race" among states to attract incorporations by making their corporate laws attractive to those who choose where to incorporate. Given that it has long been possible to incorporate in one state while doing business primarily in other states, US states have rarely been able or willing to use law tied to where a firm is incorporated to regulate or constrain corporations or those who run them. However, U.S. states have long regulated corporations with other laws (e.g., environmental laws, employment laws) that are not tied to where a firm is incorporated, but are based on where a firm does business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

From the "race" to attract incorporations, [[Delaware]] has emerged as the winner, at least among publicly traded corporations. The corporate [[franchise tax]] accounts for between 15% and 20% of the state's budget.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In Europe, regulatory competition has long been prevented by the [[real seat doctrine]] prevailing in [[private international law]] of many [[European Union|EU]] and [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member countries, which essentially required companies to be incorporated in the state where their main office was located. However, in a series of cases between 1999 and 2003 (Centros Ltd. vs. Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen, Überseering BV v Nordic Construction Company Baumanagement GmbH, Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd.), the [[European Court of Justice]] has forced member states to recognize companies chartered in other member states, which is likely to foster regulatory competition in [[European company law]]. For instance, in 2008, Germany adopted new regulations on the GmbH (Limited Liability Company), allowing the incorporation of Limited Liability Companies without a minimum capital of EUR 25,000 (though the earnings have to be retained until this threshold is reached).

===Labour law===
{{See also|Labour law}}
Countries may, for instance, seek to attract [[foreign direct investment]] by enacting a lower [[minimum wage]] than other countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Policy competition for foreign direct investment between asymmetric countries|publisher=European Economic Review|volume=50|issue=7|date=October 2006|pages=1891–1907|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2005.07.002|author1=K Bjorvatn |author2=C Eckel }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by making the labor market more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Haaland, Jan I.  |author2=Wooton, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multinational Investment, Industry Risk and Policy Competition|date=January 2002|publisher=CEPR Discussion Paper No. 3152|ssrn=298844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental law===
Legal scholars often cite environmental law as a field in which regulatory competition is particularly likely to produce a “race to the bottom” due to the externalities produced by changes in any individual state’s environmental law. Because a state is unlikely to bear all of the costs associated with any environment damage caused by industries in that state, it has an incentive to lower standards below the level that would be desirable if the state were forced to bear all of the costs.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation Interstate Competition: Rethinking the Race to the Bottom Rationale for Federal Environmental Regulation"&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Gersenzee/Revesz_RacetotheBottom.pdf Berkeley Law]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One commonly cited example of this effect is clean air laws, as states may be incentivized to lower their standards to attract business, knowing that the effects of the increased pollution will be spread across a wide area, and not simply localized within the state. Furthermore, a reduction in the standards of one state will incentivize other states to similarly lower their standards so as to not lose business.

==Public services==

===Education===
Sometimes higher-level governing bodies institute incentives to competition among lower-level governing bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Policy Competition in Multilevel Governance|author1=A Benz |author2=A Meincke |publisher=International Workshop "Regional Governance"|year=2005|citeseerx = 10.1.1.134.5357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the [[Race to the Top]] program, designed by the [[United States Department of Education]] to spur reforms in state and local district K-12 education.

The [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] likewise has initiated a program called [[InnoRegio]] to reward innovative practices.

===Health===
The high degree of [[politicization]] of the [[genetically modified organism]] issue made it a key battleground for competition for leadership, particularly between the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council of Ministers]]. The result has been a protracted battle over agenda setting and issue framing and a cycle of competitive regulatory reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Competitive Governance and the Quest for Legitimacy in the EU: the Battle over the Regulation of GMOs since the mid-1990s|author=Yves Tiberghien|doi=10.1080/07036330902782246|publisher=Journal of European Integration|volume=31|issue=3|date=May 2009|pages=389–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The struggle between insurgents and various [[Afghanistan]] states for power, control, popular support and legitimacy in the eyes of the public has been described as competitive governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Taliban Governance: Can Canada Compete? |url=http://www.seanmmaloney.com/pdfs/TalbanGov.pdf |author1=G Skogstad |author2=A Verdun |publisher=Journal of European Integration |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025208/http://www.seanmmaloney.com/pdfs/TalbanGov.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While during the [[Cold War]] security was provided by centralized institutions such as [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], now competing profit-seeking firms provide personal, national, and international security.&lt;ref name=Kristen&gt;{{cite book|title=The transformation of the European nation state|author1=Per Kristen Mydske |author2=Ingo Peters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[Arnold Kling]] notes, "In [[democratic government]], people take jurisdictions as given, and they elect leaders. In competitive government, people take leaders as given, and they select jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Competitive Government vs. Democratic Government |url=http://patrifriedman.com/saved_papers/kling_competitive_government.2008.pdf |author=Kling, Arnold }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive governance has thus far not produced an ultra-libertarian government; although Zac Gochenour has pointed out the role of potential [[international migrant]]s' [[switching cost]]s in hindering [[consumer choice]] from creating greater intergovernmental competition, [[Bryan Caplan]] has stated that "[t]he bigger problem is that almost all existing governments are either [[non-profit]]s (the [[democracies]]), have short [[time horizon]]s (the [[unstable dictatorship]]s), or reasonably worry that if they liberalize they're lose power (the [[stable dictatorship]]s)." Indeed, it has been argued by Maria Brouwer that most [[autocracies]] prefer stagnation to the vagaries inherent to expansion and other forms of innovation, since the exploration of new possibilities could lead to failure, which would undermine autocratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Democracy and Dictatorship: The Politics of Innovation |author=M Brouwer |year=2006 |url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/bin/278fulltext.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907114031/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/bin/278fulltext.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some question as to whether competitive governance can be revived in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Australia's hollow federalism: can we revive competitive governance?|author=W Kasper|publisher=Institute of Public Affairs Review: A Quarterly Review|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=199981401537291;res=IELBUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Advantages
Brennan and Buchanan (1980) argue that the public sector is a '[[Leviathan]]' which is inherently biased towards extracting money from taxpayers, but that competitive government structures can minimize such exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Local Government Structure and Performance: Lessons from America?|publisher=Public Administration|volume=70|issue=3|pages=333–357|author=Boyne, George A.|date=3 Apr 2007|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119322553/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that a decentralized competitive government structure allows for an experimentation of new public policies without doing too much harm if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Decentralized taxation and the size of government: evidence from Swiss state and local governments|author1=LP Feld |author2=G Kirchgässner |author3=CA Schaltegger |year=2003|ssrn=478261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Security, Territory, Population''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] given by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1977 and 1978 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work in which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

== Territory ==
Foucault tries to trace the 'government of things' in relation to modern society, starting with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] ''[[The Prince]]'' and its reception&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 87-114 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Machiavellian literature wanted to replace the ability of the prince to hold on to his principality with something entirely new: an art of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 92-109 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then notices that this art of government was internal to society itself, not external, this type of self-government was practiced rit throughout European society; such as Italy, Germany, France, etc. which was seized upon by the modern nation state from which it took up as its central practices. This is from as early as the 16th century which in due course enabled the elimination of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] prince as a transcendental, singularity figure of Machiavelli's prince.

All of society was enmeshed within this process including the prince (ruler) himself, thus a century later government became political and collaborative with economy (modern [[political science]] as its 'rational' spokesman) and its partnership with [[political economy]]. Foucault further notices that political economy had a new tool called statistics founded by the [[Physiocrats]] economists&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention the infamous group for this 'scientific state apparatus' the [[Physiocrats]] ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 33-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions an important figure from this period which, according to Foucault was highly influential a Physiocrat economist [[Louis Paul Abeille]] Security, Territory, Population p. 30 pp. 50-52; see notes n. 1 p. 50, n. 17, p. 52 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (another term for scientific government) and it is with [[François Quesnay]] that this process can be found the very notion of economic government. So, according to a text quoted by Foucault written by [[Guillaume de La Perrière]] "government is the right disposition of things arranged so as to lead a suitable end."&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 96 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Political means the institutions that are governing the rest of society; government covered by legal institutions which gives both the political electorate, political executive and political legitimacy,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 135-161 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 142-149 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault traces this practice to the ancient Greek text from the [[Pythagoreans]] known as ''nomas'' (meaning the law) and according to this text the shepherd is the lawmaker, he directs the flock, indicates the right direction and says how the sheep must mate to have good offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 137-140 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then reads into [[Robert Castel]]'s work; ''The Psychiatric Order'', an essential read according to Foucault, where the techniques were finally finalised during the 18th century of this absolute global project which was directed towards the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 117-119 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 10-14 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Which was public hygiene and a whole battery of other techniques were used concerning the education of children, assistance to the poor, and through the psychiatric order, the institution of workers tutelage was coordinated through psychiatric practices. These technologies of power, Foucault claims, were introduced into the 18th century emerging prison system which migrated into the modern surveillance society through the infamous system that [[Jeremy Bentham]] tried to introduce, the [[Panopticon]];&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 117, p. 131; see notes 7 and 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the modern internal and external surveillance system that modern society inhabits 'self watch' and 'self government'.

Accomplishing the unintended axiomatic affect of unaccountability, while the full focal point of a ruler is often presented unchallenged to the populace as a system of unimaginable alterations, self-perpetuating and self regularity (among those who inhabit the system), where clearly defined roles are defined and repeated right throughout the system(through norms).&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 11-13 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The system can readjust itself to whatever is thrown at it (an internal firewall integral to the system where the dangerous individual can be spotted and isolated at will). This was accomplished, according to Foucault, (rather paradoxically) from power relations elsewhere from other institutions in order to analyse them from the point of view of other technologies to free them elsewhere to form new systematic institutions as new knowledge objects. Foucault traces this original practice to government practices of the Middle Ages, where the term government meant an entirely different definition as modern society knows it. For example, 'enough wheat to govern Paris for two years', this covers a wide semantic view, it also refers to control of one's body, soul and behaviour, conduct, diet, the care given to an individual. Which Foucault very often refers to as 'governmentality', self conduct or self-government. Foucault traces this tactic back through history to the east (Mediterranean East, Egypt, Assyrian Empire, Babylonian etc.) which was specific to those societies. In Foucault own words this very aspect of Foucault's own work is still a work in progress, and is not a finalised research. However, Foucault situates this type of pastoral power squarely onto the new founded Christian Church where an organized religion ruled an entire society politically for 1500 years. And what was produced or outcome of all this turbulence was constant battles of supremacy for this type of pastoral power, government over men and their souls.

The Church rapidly colonized this type of new power between 11th and 18th century, and according to Foucault, the church laid claim to the daily government of men in their real lives on the grounds of their salvation and no example of this exist anywhere in history of societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 227-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 232-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Foucault research goes on to show that all the religious struggles from this period were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives they were practically struggles over who had the right to this power. Foucault then derives from this that from the 11th to the 18th century all the struggles of religion (wars of religion) were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives and in details and materiality of their existence; they were struggles over who has this power, from whom it derives, how it is exercised, the margin of autonomy for each, the qualification of those who exercise it, the limits of their jurisdiction, what recourse is possible against them, and what control is exercised over each. The [[Protestant Reformation]] traversed this relationship of pastorate power and what resulted from the reformation, although an historical event, was a formidable reinforcement of the pastorate system of religious power (political power in modern societies).

This type of religious power (pastoral power) was simply a reorganization of pastoral power from within, but, however, this type of reorganization of pastoral power encroached on the sovereigns (ruler) political power at the same time, it was not a smooth transition as is often portrayed. This led to a succession of tumultuous upheavals and revolts over this period, 11th-18th century; [[Norman Conquest]], [[English Civil War]], [[The Anarchy]], [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Crusades]], [[Peasants' Revolt]], [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]], [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe]]. All of which are well attested too, Foucault refers to these revolts as revolts against conduct, the most radical of which were the Protestant reformation. Foucault then concludes that this political process can be traced to the general context of resistances, revolts and great insurrections of conduct (Peasants' Revolt of 1524-1526 for example).

== Raison d'État (reason of State) ==
Foucault concludes that these insurrections of conduct push started the transition of the pastoral of souls to the political government of men and the revolts, insurrections of conduct and resistances should be seen in this context. The new economic and consequently the political relations which the old feudal structures were unable to manage and lacked any effective framework, with which they were unable to cope. Foucault notices that the pastorate community were swamped with everyday life of individuals where it took charge of a whole series of questions and problem concerning material life, property, education of children. This led to an re-emergence of philosophy as the answer to the fundamental question of everyday life, in relation to others, in relation to those in authority, to the sovereign, or the feudal lord, and in order to direct one's mind as well, and to direct it in the right direction, to its salvation, certainly, but also to the truth.

Philosophy took over from this period; on the religious function of how to conduct oneself as a result of taking a form that was not specially religious or ecclesiastical. With the advent of the 16th century western society enter the age of forms of conducting, directing, and government. Foucault then considers these great upheavals of [[Medieval Europe]] as nothing else but the translation of the continuum from god to men, political institutions and the political order. Which was broken by all the upheaval that Europe had suffered. This produced a series of conflicts among those who tried to define sovereignty (not political sovereignty as we know it) but the art of government, ''principia naturae'' (reason of government) which brought in the political philosophy doctrine, known as [[raison d'État]] (reason of state).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Western society begins to define itself as territorial and expansionary with means of security as its primary focus.

Foucault reads into this that the philosophy of raison d'État having found its way into Europe through the [[Peace of Westphalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] in modern thought);&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions the term as it was known then, Balance of Europe; however, the word 'Europe' was an entirely new concept in 17th century Europe, it had no basis nor meaning to thinkers of political thought from this period but the term balance of Europe and whose chief political architect and origin of the term can be found in the works of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. The other 'scientific' proponent of the idea of balance of Europe can be found in the works of none other than mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] "What is the balance of Europe?It is the idea of a political-military physics in which variable antagonistic forces are exercised in terms of random violent clashes of some with others, of some against others. The balance of Europe is not a problem of statics, but of dynamics." ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 297-310 p. 308, notes 14, 16 for Guicciardini 2007&lt;/ref&gt; this can be found in the works of Italian political philosopher [[Giovanni Botero]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 237-240 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; where Botero concluded that the state is a firm domination over peoples and to keep hold of its preservation one was expected to have knowledge of the appropriate means for founding preserving, and expanding such a domination.

This political philosophy of raison d'État was made as the chief political philosophy (with its accompanied rationality) in mainland Europe. Foucault's analysis of raison d'État (here [[Bogislaw Philipp von Chemnitz]] son of [[Martin von Chemnitz]]) writing under the pseudonym ''[[Hippolithus a Lapide]]'' first starts to query the first uses of the doctrine of raison d'État at the Treaty of Westphalia, where among the diplomatic community the doctrine starts to become popular for discussion&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 240-248, pp. 250-252, notes, 24-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;) offers interesting conclusions of this new type of power the transition of the government of souls to the government of men. This first takes place between 13th century and the 18th century, from the 16th century the subject starts to appear of an idea of perpetual peace taken from the Middle Ages idea. Which primarily belonged to the church, from the 16th century therefore, exists the idea of a 'balance of power', with few exceptions, this idea became problematic, it started or rather had to included the populace.

The solution to this problematic situation was the inclusion, within the philosophy of raison d'État, the incorporation of the populace which the machinery of the state had to govern. The government of men as Foucault refers to it, directly from the pastorate community to the transfer to the political community. Foucault then further shows that raison d'État was not much concerned with legality (as we know the term) but with political necessity; politics is concerned with necessity and if necessary politics must become violent lending to [[coup d'état]]; this means that it is obliged to sacrifice, to sever, cause harm, and it is led to be unjust and murderous. This produced a whole series of problematic solutions to this problem, of which the population became of primary concern, coup d'état&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 260-267 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 277-278 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; politics isn't the practice as we know it today. Under the auspices of the [[Renaissance]] was not primarily concerned with legitimacy, but survival of the state.

Foucault then tries to show only when the problem of population and security starts taking effect amongst the different practices that the consideration of population becomes a worry. Foucault then notices a point of departure pointing out the idea of sedition and revolt starts to enter texts, but 'the people' proved elusive to define all around Europe, and never entered popular discussion, at first point of juncture was the privileged titled nobles appointed and rewarded through the honours system created by the monarch and sanctioned through the legal system of the day; the entire [[Nobility]] knight's, barons, dukes, earl's and their rivals began to become seen and known as 'the people'.&lt;ref&gt;"The people were too hard for the King in property; and then in arms too hard for him. We must either lay the foundation in property, or else it will not stand. Property, generally, is now with the people; the government, therefore, must be there." ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All government is built upon propriety, else the poor must rule it. All nations are so. Let us therefore consider things before persons. Government is built upon propriety, therefore lands, leases, or goods, should be represented, rather than the people."Quoted from Captain Baynes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A certain Mr. Neville refers to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] brought in by [[Henry VIII]] and parliament by the authority and power given to the monarch of the day by the [[Act of Supremacy]] passed by parliament under Henry VIII which brought the first ensemble apparatus of what would later become known as the Welfare state 350 years later Quoted From ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3 '' pp. 132-134 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I wonder what is the necessity for this previous vote. We are returned to the law of nature. It is said in the Bill the people have all acknowledged him. I thought the people had been only here. Either he is so, or he is not so. If so, there is no necessity for this House declaring him so. If not, there is need of some consideration. The Bill makes it hereditary. Where it speaks of successor, it mentions nothing of the Petition and Advice. It is fit you should be satisfied whether he be so. It should be made out. It makes him Supreme Magistrate, and gives him as great a power as ever King of England had. I would know what the words mean, if it give him not the executive and legislative power as fully as any King. Consider whether you do not put yourselves out of a capacity of recalling your liberties, by this step. First, you settle a monarch; one estate before the other two" Quoted from Captain Baynes Baynes refers to the 'people' in terms only limited to those 'elected' "that out of the 658 members sent to the House, only 171 were sent by the people. In 1794, "the majority of the House of Commons," for England and Wales, was computed to be "chosen by less than eight thousand, out of eight millions" which comprises less than 00.001% of the 'people' to the House of commons; see note 38 taken from ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3'' pp. 145-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Foucault considers the breakthrough of "this governmental reasoning" of the population as a substantial event in Western history and society comparable to the [[scientific revolution]] of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-286 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a substantial transfer of techniques and technologies were transferred from the sovereign individual (the monarch) to a new modified apparatus known as the [[Disciplinary institutions]], of the 18th century and its scientific representatives [[Carceral archipelago]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (all in the space of 80 years Foucault's notices) which culminated into a new version known as [[nation state]]s. This change took place in the 16th century and continued right through into the 19th century. Foucault then gives examples of this procedure through the system known as ''[[raison d'État]]'', from this analytical view of the state by [[Claude Fleury]],&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 323-324 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 331, notes 31, 32, 34, 38 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; war, raising finance, justice; there must be an abundance of men (large scale phenomena of population).

It is not the absolute number of the population that counts, but its relationship with the set composition of forces: the size of the territory, natural resources, wealth, commercial activities and so on. From Fleury's point of view, according to Foucault, the more there are of men, the stronger the state and the prince will be. So, according to Fleury, it is not expanse of land (expansion of the territory) that contributes greatness of the state but fertility and the number of men. Foucault then introduces into his [[Ontogenetic]] and, [[Phylogenetic]] investigations the concept of '[[police]]' (see also [[miasma theory of disease]]); not the police of the [[criminal justice system]] as we know it today, but as concept known at that time as urbanisation of the territory and administrative concern; which means making the kingdom, the entire territory into a large industrious town. Foucault then considers how [[Mercantilism]] played a big role in this new context of European balance of power; these are the mercantilist requirements: every country should try to have the largest possible population, second; the entire population be eligible for working and be able to be put to work, third; wages given to the population be as low as possible, fourth; the cost price of goods at the lowest price as possible. Police according to Foucault consists of a sovereign exercise of royal power over individuals who are therefore subjects.

The actual police is the direct governmentality of the sovereign who rules through raison d'État. What Foucault means by the governmentality of the sovereign is the mind of the police runs through all of the populations, collective consciousness therefore, reducing criminality not its complete elimination, for political and economic reasons (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''), not through fear, but the knowledge of the police as a system with its own structural objective as laws, judicial, legislative operating as a microcosm of the societal body, which ultimately represents the sovereigns will. Initially, however, this was not the sole intention of the police as we know it where Foucault introduces the original founder of the system now known to us as the police, [[Nicolas Delamare|Nicolas Delamare (1639-1723)]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Delamare 1639-1723 Delamare served as Superintendent at Chatelet from 1673 to 1710 under the lieutenancy of La Reynie this is Foucault's only mention of La Reynie in his lectures for more information on Delamare see ''Security, Territory, Population'' the following notes p. 53 n. 26, pp. 359-360 n. 1-9 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (Foucault doesn’t mention the real founder of the police [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]]).

Foucault concentrates on how the police became an integral feature and intermingled with population, tracing the system on its foundation on how this is arranged around the composition of forces which the whole Western system of the balance of power, raison E’tat was organised and arranged around. This system consisted of an organised scientifically trained professional army,(as opposed to a private army organised around the service of the king) incorporated within this military system is [[Thantopolitics]]([[Political power]] used through the military system for the purposes of warfare by other means) for the purposes of the slaughtering of millions of people if necessary,on an industrial scale,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 299, pp. 304-306, p. 307, notes 9-19 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a system of legitimacy, comprising the sovereign, not the sovereign as a singular ruler but as an organised superstructure institution(modern government) comprising societal state functions, [[Political sovereignty]] which guaranteed the sovereign's legitimacy, judiciary, legislator, [[Parliamentary]] system; political power, political executive, political elite, and a political communication system while not offered any considerable attention by some Social scientist and historians nevertheless,these techniques do indeed exist,where it is admitted as such by those actual professional technicians(one such technique used is known professionally as the [[Sabido method]] pioneered by [[Miguel Sabido]] derived from the field of [[entertainment-education]])and the political arm of this technique simply known as [[Demagogue]] who are involved in the operation of these techniques of deception and persuasion and a whole group of professional manipulators are needed which is primarily aimed at the entire worldwide television audience and political community.&lt;ref&gt;"Since The Arrival of mass communication,a particular kind of image making has grown into a central feature of the political processes of Western democracies.The book will argue that a core feature of mass democratic politics is ''hype making''.Just as magicians smoke-and mirrors-to distract their audidences and conjure up illusions so too does the political machine and its media staffers.In today's Western democracies,television is the primary(but not exclusive)vehicle for this smoke-and-mirrors show.This show involves four sets of players:politicians-as-performers;the spin industry;media workers(journalists,presenters/hosts and researchers);and their audiencies. A fifth set of players are policy makers-but they tend to remain back stage;shielded from as much scrutiny as possible by the smoke and mirriors show.A core aim of this book is to unravel the symbiotic relationships between journalists,and spin doctors and politicians within contemporary televisualized politics.The book will argue that Demagoguery has become a core feature 20th century Western politics,with politics now characterized by a range of demagogic arts geared to steering mass public opinion.These demagogic arts will be described and analyzed." Eric Louwe ''The Media and Political Process'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David O Poindexter]] ''Out Of The Darkness Of Centuries:A 45 Year Odyssey To Discover The Use Of Mass Media For Human Betterment'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halisbury Laws Of England Volume 34 Parliament 4th Edition 1984''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell's time. Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services, and then adapted to politics. Their distinguishing feature is that they can be bought for money. More recently, cognitive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective, giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on "getting results"

These professionals take pride in their accomplishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved. That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper's concept of an open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.

Popper failed to recognise that in democratic politics, gathering public support takes precedence over the pursuit of truth. In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one's views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality. But in politics the electorate's perception of reality can be easily manipulated. As a result, political discourse, even in democratic societies, does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.

The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth. They want to win elections, and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit."

And finally, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle; the western political system of [[consent of the governed]]. This system at least gives the rationale of why it was necessary to have on board a widely disparate atomized populace; and its use, through the not widely known and little understood function of the [[Royal Prerogative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|format=PDF|title=Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers 2010|publisher=Justice.gov.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091111115352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/422.pdf |format=PDF|title=Taming the Prerogative: Strengthening Ministerial Accountability to Parliament 2004|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault doesn't use the phrase [[Royal Prerogative]] but uses the term 'Royal power' ''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp. 7-9, p. 37 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of which can be traced back to the Middle Ages from where the western system of political power gets its central idea, from the point of view and simple justification of consent of the governed, legitimacy and political power. This legitimacy, which is exercised through the use of Parliamentary democracy(see also [[Greek government debt crisis]], [[National unity government]], [[European sovereign debt crisis]]), was essential to the western system of political power and modern government;"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government","The people" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes'" or "Popular sovereignty or the sovereignty of the people is the political principle that the legitimacy of the state is created by the will or consent of its people, who are the source of all political power".

All of this Foucault calls the political technology of biopower. This had to have the entire population on board in terms of ‘the police’, which had an entirely different meaning from what we know it today by tracing the concept back through time from the 15th century and 16th century usage, previous thinkers meant the term as a community association governed by a public authority and political power with accountability to a public authority. By quoting [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] “of laws and regulations that concern the interior of a state and which endeavors to strengthen and increase the power of this state and make good use of its forces".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 314-315 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population''; see note 8 pp. 329-330 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

What Foucault reveals is that the original police had a different function as we know it today; for example one of their primary function was to administer the state in the guise of statisticians, allocating resources, supervision of grain in times of crisis, ensuring circulation of goods and men, secure the development of the state's forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 311-332 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was so successful this then led to an extension of the franchising out in the form of recruitment of the then [[University]] system. This bought in the next generation of administrators for the new ‘nation state’ system. This bought in two types of police; administrators who formed the [[Polizeiwissenschaft]]; the science of police or the science of government of the state, the other type would become known as what we know and associate the term today [[criminal justice system]], [[Law enforcement]], [[Forensic science]] and the modern uniformed police [[Polizeistaat]] police state, translated into English as policing of the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 318-319 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 330; see note 14 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from Germany, this system spread right throughout Europe from the middle of the 17th century and most crucially, this Polizeiwissenschaft grow a substantial bibliography of this system ‘science of police’ by the 19th century. Foucault's research shows that some 4000 different pamphlets and articles had emerged from 1520-1850 under the titles of “science of police in the broad sense” and “science of the police in the strict sense”.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 318 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 330; see note 11 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as [[Cameral]] science(the new modern [[Public administration]]). The future administrators for the future modern nation state system with many functions; such as [[bureaucrats]], [[civil servants]], [[Think tanks]], [[public policy]] makers, [[economists]] all from the university system.

== Obedience ==
For Foucault obedience was a vital mechanism of salvation of the government, not in the form of blind loyalty, but in the form of political salvation of the state(see [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath of Allegiance]] for example). This led to political theorists of the day juxtaposing theories concerning state, government, body politics, and political power; these theorists dare not call these laws divine or God-made law, but instead refer to them as 'philosophical'. As in [[Gabriel Naudé]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 252, note 40 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an agent of Richelieu's, where he refers to the salvation of the state "The coup d'état does not comply with natural, universal noble and philosophical, it complies with an artificial, particular, political justice concerning the necessity of the state&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp. 260-261, p. 263, pp. 280-281, notes 20-21, 24-25, 26 2007&lt;/ref&gt;". For Foucault, politics is not above this process which it cannot be afforded, therefore, is not something that has to fall within a remit of legality or a system of laws. Politics, according to Foucault's use of the term, is concerned with necessity, necessity of the state which puts to an end to all privileges in order to make itself obeyed by everyone. So you do not have government connected with legality, but raison d'État connected with necessity.

Foucault then touches briefly on the theatrical practice of raison d'État and its prevalence over legitimacy. Which would be rather ironical as this is the main problem of theatrical practice in politics, which was in reality the practice of raison d'État. The theatre where this is played out in the form of dramatization and a constant mode of manifestation of the state and the sovereign as the holder of state power. Thus, for Foucault analysis this contrasts differently with and in opposition to traditional ceremonies of royalty which from anointment to coronation up to the entry into towns or major cities or iconic, famous funerals of infamous monarchs, this marked the religious association of the sovereign, or at least the sovereign's alliance with the character and association with religious power and theology. This, Foucault notices was [[William Shakespeare]]'s main intention where the political representation (modern representation of this is media visual representation of political power, political consultants, image makers (media consultants), and 'power politics' and its constant fixation with voting and leading political personalities) of the sovereign [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] for example was a part of historical drama, although based on real people and events, but for all intents and purposes was political representation in the form of plots, intrigues, disgraces, preferences, exclusions, good guys and bad guys and political exiles, where the theatre represents the state itself.

Foucault now turns his attention to obedience and the population and why this was a problem among political theorists of the times. He then produces [[Francis Bacon]]'s text "Of Seditions and Troubles". In this essay Bacon gives a complete description on the physics of sedition, sedition and the precautions to be taken against it, and of government of the 'people'. This became a worry for Bacon and other political theorists; the first signs of sedition were circulation of libels, pamphlets and discourse against the state and those who govern. Second, Bacon notices the reversal of values or evaluations which puts the existence at risk. Weakness in the chain of command. Foucault reads into Bacon the theory of revolt of the people and there are two categories of individuals within the state, the common people (very often referred in text as [[Peasants]], the [[People]], the [[Common people]], the poor, or at times [[Vagabond (person)|Vagabond]] vagrants) and the nobility, what differentiates the common people and the nobility is their unshared interest.

They do not have any common interest between the two groups in Bacon's view the common people are too slow to engage in revolt and sedition. But if the common people and the nobility ever unite and become one unit they represent a threat to the sovereign's rule. A slow people and a weak nobility (because of their small number) mean that sedition can be prevented and discontents stopped from contaminating each other. Bacon then views the process of the danger of sedition where you can either buy the nobility or you can execute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 267-275 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of the common people becomes a different matter, they are not easily bought. So Bacon himself offers a whole series of measures and reforms that should be implemented, reducing the rate of interest, avoiding excessively large estates, increased wages, promoting external trade increasing the value of raw materials through work, and assuring provisions of transport to foreign countries.

While the differences between Bacon and Machiavelli appear subtle, it was 250 years later that the political model of reforms changed, why? Foucault was not much interested into the notion of reform as 'cure', but what was behind the underlying mechanism that was driving the system of reform ensuring reforms become a permanent feature of 'failure'. Foucault begins to trace through this development through the political model of reform and one crucial development was the economy, a politics of economic calculation with Mercantilism and for Foucault this was not just a theory but was above all else a political practice. The invention of the political campaign which Foucault traces back through its original modern founder, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who according to Foucault actually invented the modern political campaign by means of lampoons and pamphlets and more importantly, invented those professional manipulators of opinion who were called at the time ''[[publiciste]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 283, notes 59, 60 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for Foucault raison d'État must always act on the collective consciousness of the population, not only to impose some true or false belief on them, as when, for example, sovereigns want to create belief in their own legitimacy or in illegitimacy of their rivals, but in such away that the collective opinion can be modified along with their behaviour as economic and political subjects. The main function of public opinion is to produce a politics of believable truth within raison d'État.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious example of all this is that propaganda, in its political sense has a twofold objective: 1, The main function of public opinion is to produce an emergence, alliance between political propaganda and a belief system of politics of truth within collective consciousness, a version of political continuity within raison d’Etat, this practice of political reform, while ensuring that the essential features of the system remain intact, gets passed on to future generations ensuring failure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 2, The other main political purposes of propaganda is to make sure that the chaos of modern living becomes accepted as the norm therefore, rendering whole swathes of society useless (through cultural practices), in its objectives to do anything about it. You can do something about it, but only within the rules of a political tool, even within the confines of political buffoons who appear to have no hold or control of the system that they are in charge of.

This political tool is soiled and rigged against those who use it and cannot be used for practical change but its power comes from those who gives comfort to those who use it in the hope of a false belief of change can happen leaving the practicalities of the system as ‘real’ events. This, Foucault notices produced two consensus correlations namely; birth of economists, birth of the ‘’publicistes’’ known as economy and public opinion the two correlative elements of field of reality that is emerging as the direct correlate of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 163-185 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salvation ==
[[Mercantilism]], according to Foucault, was the first rationalization of the exercise of power as a practice of government; it is the first time that a knowledge of the state can be employed as tactics for the state, namely statistics. Foucault begins to chart through this historical, political reasoning behind the doctrine [[raison d'État]] (reason of state). The time of the Middle Ages where the idea existed of an indefinite permanent character of political power and government. This perpetual discourse, the idea of progress in men's knowledge about themselves and towards others, however, one thing was internally missing from this analysis, namely the notion of population. Foucault traces the conceptual discourse of the populace back to the Middle Ages definition of the pastorate which to the Middle Ages mind meant salvation, obedience and truth. First of all the discourse of raison d'État and salvation; Foucault manages to trace conceptually the system of salvation through the 17th century usage of coup d'état politics. Foucault notices that entire treatise were devoted to the very notion of coup d'état, for example a text written in 1639 by [[Gabriel Naudé]], entitled ''Considerations sur les coups d'etat'' and writing in 1631 Foucault sites [[Jean Sirmond]] ''Le Coup d’Estat de Louis XIII''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 280-281, notes 19, 20, 24, 26 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders''' ({{lang-fi|Työväen ja Pienviljelijäin Sosialidemokraattinen Liitto}}, TPSL) was a political party in [[Finland]]. TPSL originated as a fraction of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]], headed by [[Emil Skog]] and [[Aarre Simonen]]. Skog was the former chairman of SDP and was in dispute with the incumbent chairman, Väinö Leskinen. The party was founded in 1959, had seats in the parliament in 1959–1970 and was dissolved in 1973. It was generally identified as being politically between SDP and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SKDL]] (a Communist-dominated organization).
==History==
The fraction split from SDP in 1959 after few years of infighting, and retained SDP's party platform until 1967, opining that SDP didn't follow its own platform. The main cause for the rift was that SDP's party leadership, particularly [[Väinö Tanner]] and [[Väinö Leskinen]] wanted to develop the party towards a "general party" appealing to the entire public. TPSL in contrast, as the name suggests, wanted SDP to be a special interest party for the workers and small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Rauli Mickelsson. Suomen puolueet - Historia, muutos ja nykypäivä. Vastapaino 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Leskinen wanted to co-operate with the right wing, based SDP politics on the general population, and his economic policy was conservative and deflatory, and he criticised [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]. In contrast, Skog's fraction wanted to co-operate with the agrarians and other leftists in [[popular front]] governments (''kansanrintamahallitus''), and base their politics exclusively on the trade unions. For example, Heikki Laavola has written that the disagreement was not over left vs. right ideology; all of Tanner, Leskinen, Skog and Simonen had been formerly active in anti-Communist pursuits. Disagreements between and about individuals played a role; Tanner had actually been convicted (under Soviet pressure) for being responsible to the [[Continuation War]], and as such, he being the leader of SDP was a problem to the Soviets.

The rift was accompanied by a division in associated societies and the trade unions. The main trade union, [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]], was controlled mostly by Skog's men, as was [[Socialist Youth League of Finland|the youth league]], [[Finnish Workers' Sports Federation|sports federation]] and [[Social Democratic Women's League (Finland)|women's league]]. The first example was that SDP's leadership wanted the worker's sports federation to associate with the right-wing sports federation in order to qualify for entry to [[Olympics]], which Skog's fraction disputed as bourgeoise.

TPSL had 13-15 representatives of 200 in the [[Eduskunta|parliament]] after the split in 1959, gained only two in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1962|1962 elections]], got seven representatives in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1966|1966]] and permanently dropped out of the parliament in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1970|1970]]. Significantly, TPSL co-operated with the especially powerful President [[Urho Kekkonen]], and was a partner in coalition cabinets (Karjalainen I, Paasio I, Koivisto I). In 1963, SDP changed its policy such that good relations with Kekkonen and Soviet Union were a new priority, thus removing a significant cause for disagreement. Skog himself returned to SDP in 1965. TPSL radicalized and became more Soviet-friendly, but lost its popular support, and was dissolved in 1973. The decision was made in December 1972 as TPSL board voted 10–3 for the return to the SDP.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Devlin: [http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml Death of a Splinter Party: Finland's Left-Socialists Give Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108085222/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml |date=2012-01-08 }} (Radio Free Europe 5.12.1972)&lt;/ref&gt; A minority faction, including Simonen and some other former MPs, formed the [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]].

'''Greyshirts''' or '''''Gryshemde''''' is the common short-form name given to the '''South African Gentile National Socialist Movement''', a [[South Africa]]n [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement that existed during the 1930s and 1940s. Initially referring only to a paramilitary group, it soon became shorthand for the movement as a whole.

The [[NSDAP/AO]] arrived in South Africa in 1932 and as a result a number of groups sympathetic to Nazism emerged. The most notable of these was the South African Gentile National Socialist Movement (also known as the South African Christian National Socialist Movement), formed by [[Louis Weichardt]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A fiercely [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] group, it organised the Gryshemde as its equivalent of the [[Sturmabteilung]], although the grey shirt became so associated with the group that it was applied to the movement as a whole. In contrast to some extremist groups the Greyshirts did not split along linguistic lines, but rather sought to work with both the [[Afrikaans]] and the [[English language|English]]-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;Aletta J. Norval, ''Deconstructing Apartheid Discourse'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greyshirts struggled to maintain unity and spawned a number of minor splinter groups, such as Johannes von Moltke's South African Fascists. Most of these groups united under [[Daniel François Malan]]'s aegis when he formed his [['Purified' National Party]], although the Greyshirts did not take part and contested the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 election]] alone. The decision proved unwise, however, as the Greyshirts failed to make any impact.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The group was roundly attacked by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], with an article appearing in ''[[Die Burger]]'' in October 1934 stating that: 'We believe that this party, generally known as the Greyshirts, under the cloak of an anti-Jewish movement, strives for a dangerous form of government in South Africa. The Greyshirts have as their aim to set up a dictator in South Africa.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html Followers of Hitler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html |date=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jew]]ish immigration from [[Nazi Germany]] to South Africa grew significantly during the 1930s and the Greyshirts launched a campaign calling for an end to the practice. A ship was chartered by the Council for German Jewry, a UK-based group, to bring as many Jews as possible to [[Cape Town]], leading to the Greyshirts organising a mass protest against the move. The scale of opposition was such that [[Sarah Millin]] appealed to [[Jan Smuts]] to deal with the Greyshirts, although her request was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Bathsheba Braude, 'Introduction', ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in South Africa: An Anthology''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, relations between the National Party and the Greyshirts actually improved, initially as a result of a 1937 letter from [[Frans Erasmus]], at the time Secretary of the National Party, praising the Greyshirts for bringing the "Jewish problem" to the fore and culminating in a number of leading Greyshirts also holding National Party membership.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bunting, ''The Rise of the South African Reich'', Penguin Books, 1969, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities were monitored during the [[Second World War]], although the Greyshirts continued to exist and renamed themselves the White Workers Party in 1949. However, by this time most of the membership had been lost to the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] and so the Greyshirts faded.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

This article is a list of major figures in the theory of [[libertarianism]], a philosophy asserting that individuals have a right to be free. Originally coined by French anarchist [[Joseph Déjacque]] as an alternative to anarchism, in the 1950s American classical liberals decided to appropriate the term to for their philosophy which asserts that individuals have a right to acquire, keep, and exchange their holdings and that the primary purpose of government is to protect these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallentyne|first1=Peter|title=Libertarianism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/|website=Stanford|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uyghur nationalism''', or the '''East Turkestan independence movement''', is the notion that the [[Uyghurs]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[ethnic group]] who primarily inhabit [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang]] region (or "[[East Turkestan]]"), should form an independent state. Unlike the [[Han Chinese]] population, dominant throughout most of China, Uyghurs speak the [[Uyghur language]] and are generally [[Muslim]].

The history of the region has become highly politicized, with both Chinese and nationalist Uyghur historians frequently overstating the extent of their groups' respective ties to the region.&lt;ref name="Bovingdon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gardner Bovingdon|title=The Uyghurs: Strangers in Their Own Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrtIa77Sj2IC|date=6 August 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51941-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it has been home to many groups throughout history, with the Uyghurs arriving from Central Asia in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=Edward |title=The Dead Tell a Tale China Doesn’t Care to Listen To |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/asia/19mummy.html |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century they made up the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=11}} In 1933 and 1944 attempts were made to declare an independent republic, but the [[First East Turkestan Republic|first]] of these collapsed and the [[Second East Turkestan Republic|second]] was absorbed into People's Republic of China in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1909416,00.html|title=A Brief History of the Uighurs|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|date=2009-07-09|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-independence groups maintain that this constitutes an illegal occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Turkistan |url=http://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/?page_id=29681 |website=World Uyghur Congress |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a [[Migration to Xinjiang|state-orchestrated mass migration]] from the 1950s to the 1970s has brought millions of Han Chinese into Xinjiang.

These factors have led to ongoing [[Xinjiang conflict|conflict]] with police and Han Chinese, including both frequent terrorist attacks and wider public unrest (such as the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]]).&lt;ref name="QZ"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Lindsey |last2=Paul |first2=Nathan |title=China created a new terrorist threat by repressing this ethnic minority |url=https://qz.com/993601/china-uyghur-terrorism/ |website=qz.com |publisher=Quartz |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name "East Turkestan" was created by the Russian Sinologist [[Nikita Bichurin]] to replace the term "Chinese Turkestan" in 1829.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=34}} "East Turkestan" was used traditionally to only refer to the [[Tarim Basin]], and not Xinjiang as a whole, with [[Dzungaria]] being excluded from the area consisting of "East Turkestan".

Xinjiang before the [[Qing dynasty]] did not exist as one unit. It consisted of the two separate political entities of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Eastern Turkestan).{{sfn|Michell|1870|p=2}}{{sfn|Martin|1847|p=21}}{{sfn|Fisher|1852|p=554}}{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica|1894|p=681}} There was the Zhunbu (Dzungar region) and Huibu (Muslim region){{sfn|Millward|2007|p=97}} Dzungharia or Ili was called Zhunbu 準部 (Dzungar region) Tianshan Beilu 天山北路 (Northern March), "Xinjiang" 新疆 (New Frontier),{{sfn|Millward|1998|p=21}} Dzongarie, Djoongaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Recit Officiiel de La Conquete du Turkestan par les Chinois (1758–1760) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MysOTiETbsC&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Bulletin de la Section de géographie |volume=Volume 10 |date=1896 |p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soungaria,{{sfn|Bridgman|Williams|1837|p=273}}{{sfn|Bridgman|Williams|1837|p=273}} or "Kalmykia" (La Kalmouquie in French).{{sfn|Mentelle|Malte-Brun|de Halle|1804|page=144}}{{sfn|Mentelle|Malte-Brun|de Halle|1804|page=160}} It was formerly the area of the [[Zunghar Khanate]] 準噶爾汗國, the land of the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]].

====Pan-Mongolian movements in Xinjiang====

Mongols have at times advocated for the historical Oirat Dzungar Mongol area of Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, to be annexed to the Mongolian state in the name of [[Pan-Mongolism]].

Legends grew among the remaining Oirats that Amursana had not died after he fled to Russia, but was alive and would return to his people to liberate them from Manchu Qing rule and restore the Oirat nation. Prophecies had been circulating about the return of Amursana and the revival of the Oirats in the Altai region.{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|pp=27, 28, 29}}{{sfn|Ostasiatische Seminar|1982|p=164}} The Oirat Kalmyk [[Ja Lama]] claimed to be a grandson of Amursana and then claimed to be a reincarnation of Amursana himself, preaching anti-Manchu propaganda in western Mongolia in the 1890s and calling for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.{{Sfn|Lattimore|1955|page=57}} Ja Lama was arrested and deported several times. However, he returned to the Oirat Torghuts in [[Altay Prefecture|Altay]] (in Dzungaria) in 1910 and in 1912 he helped the Outer Mongolians mount an attack on the last Qing garrison at [[Khovd (city)|Kovd]], where the Manchu Amban was refusing to leave and fighting the newly declared independent Mongolian state.{{sfn|Croner|2009|p=11}}{{Sfn|Croner|2010|p=11}}{{sfn|Pegg|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Sinor|1990|p=5}}{{sfn|Baabar|1999|p=139}} The Manchu Qing force was defeated and slaughtered by the Mongols after Khovd fell.{{sfn|Mongolia Society|1970|p=17}}

Ja Lama told the Oirat remnants in Xinjiang: "I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country.

====East Turkestan independence movements====
A rebellion in Kashgar against [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] rule led to the establishment of the short-lived [[First East Turkestan Republic]] or Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan (1933–1934). The Chinese Hui Muslim [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] crushed the Turkic First East Turkestan Republic at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1933)]] and [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. Hui Muslim leaders like [[Ma Shaowu]], General [[Ma Zhancang]] and General [[Ma Fuyuan]] fought the Turkic separatists.

During the [[Kumul Rebellion]] in Xinjiang in the 1930s, Buddhist murals were deliberately vandalized by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=13 December 1943 |title=Old Sterile Death Leaves its Mark over Sinkiang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |journal=Life |page=99 |volume=15 |number=24 |issn=0024-3019 |publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheng Shicai]], a secret member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], came into power after a military coup. He disobeyed the decree and order from the Chinese central government, but still ruled the region under the name of the Republic of China.
[[File:Second ETR in China.svg|The [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed unrecognised republic in northern Xinjiang.|thumb|right]]

Sheng Shicai later became anti-Russian when he became aware of the Soviet's intent to control his government. He expelled Soviet advisors and executed many Han Communists. [[Joseph Stalin]] was very angry with his convert and dispatched troops to invade Xinjiang. The Soviet troops helped the rebellion at [[Yining City|Ili]] (Yining City) during the [[Chinese civil war]]. The rebellion lead to the establishment of the [[Second East Turkistan Republic]] (1944–1949), which existed in three northern districts ([[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]], [[Tacheng Prefecture|Tarbaghatai]], [[Altay Prefecture|Altai]]) of Xinjiang province of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] with secret aid from the [[Soviet Union]] (Russia used consistent effort to annex Chinese territory since the 17th century). The majority of Xinjang remained under the control of the Republic of China.

After winning the Chinese civil war in 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|took control of Xinjiang from Republic of China forces and the Second East Turkestan Republic]].

[[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] [[Jadidism|Jadidists]] and East Turkestan Independence activists [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] and [[Masud Sabri]] rejected the Soviets and [[Sheng Shicai]]'s imposition of the name "[[Uyghur people]]" upon the Turkic people of Xinjiang. They wanted instead the name "Turkic ethnicity" ({{zh|c=突厥族|p=tūjué zú}}) to be applied to their people. Masud Sabri also viewed the [[Hui people]] as [[Muslim]] [[Han Chinese]] and separate from his own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. X.

He slammed Sheng Shicai for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities, which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=209}}

The usage of the name "Uyghur" for the modern ethnic group has led to anachronisms and falsehood when applied to history by both the PRC and Uyghur nationalists.{{sfn|Reed|Raschke|2010|p=7}}

===People's Republic of China===

At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |title=Demographics and Development in Xinjiang after 1949 |first=Stanley |last=Toops |date=May 2004 |page=1 |issue=1 |location=Washington, D.C. |work=Working Papers |publisher=[[East–West Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=243}} Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang ([[Dzungaria]]).{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=104}}

Uyghur nationalists often incorrectly claim that 5% of Xinjiang's population in 1949 was Han, and that the other 95% was Uyghur, erasing the presence of [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]], [[Xibe people|Xibes]], and others, and ignoring the fact that Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population at 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=197}}

In 1955 (the first modern census in China was taken in 1953), Uyghurs were counted as 73% of Xinjiang's total population of 5.11 million.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=199}} Although Xinjiang as a whole is designated as a "Uyghur Autonomous Region", since 1954 more than 50% of Xinjiang's land area are designated autonomous areas for 13 native non-Uyghur groups.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=43–46}} The modern [[Uyghur people]] experienced [[ethnogenesis]] especially from 1955, when the PRC officially recognized that ethnic category - in opposition to the Han - of formerly separately self-identified oasis peoples.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=176}}

The People's Republic of China has directed the majority of Han migrants towards the sparsely populated Dzungaria (Junggar Basin), before 1953 most of Xinjiang's population (75%) lived in the Tarim Basin, so the new Han migrants resulted in the distribution of population between Dzungaria and the Tarim being changed.{{sfn|Pletcher|2011|p=318}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falkenheim |first=Victor C. |title=Xinjiang |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=27 March 2013 |edition=online |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Xinjiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most new Chinese migrants ended up in the northern region, in Dzungaria.{{sfn|Martyn|1978|p=358}} Han and Hui made up the majority of the population in Dzungaria's cities while Uighurs made up most of the population in Kashgaria's cities.{{sfn|Ethnological information on China|196?|p=2}} Eastern and Central Dzungaria are the specific areas where these Han and Hui are concentrated.{{sfn|Ethnological information on China|196?|p=7}} China made sure that new Han migrants were settled in entirely new areas uninhabited by Uyghurs so as to not disturb the already existing Uyghur communities.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=38}} Lars-Erik Nyman noted that Kashgaria was the native land of the Uighurs, "but a migration has been in progress to Dzungaria since the 18th century".{{sfn|Nyman|1977|p=12}}

Both Han economic migrants from other parts of China and Uyghur economic migrants from southern Xinjiang have been flooding into northern Xinjiang since the 1980s.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=42}}

Southern Xinjiang is where the majority of the Uyghur population resides, while it is in Northern Xinjiang cities where the majority of the Han (90%) population of Xinjiang reside.{{sfn|Guo|2007|p=220}} Southern Xinjiang is dominated by its nine million Uighur majority population, while northern Xinjiang is where the mostly urban Han population holds sway.{{sfn|Guo|2009|p=164}} This situation has been followed by an imbalance in the economic situation between the two ethnic groups, since the Northern Junghar Basin (Dzungaria) has been more developed than the Uighur south.{{sfn|Howell|2009|p=37}}

Since the [[Chinese economic reform]] from the late 1970s has exacerbated uneven regional development, more Uyghurs have migrated to Xinjiang cities and some Hans have also migrated to Xinjiang for independent economic advancement. Increased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur [[Terrorism in the People's Republic of China|separatist terrorism]] from the 1990s, such as the [[1997 Ürümqi bus bombings]].{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=173–175}}

In the 1980s, 90% of Xinjiang Han lived in north Xinjiang (Jiangbei, historical Dzungaria). In the mid-1990s, Uyghurs consisted of 90% of south Xinjiang (Nanjiang, historical Tarim)'s population.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=241}} In 1980, the liberal reformist [[Hu Yaobang]] announced the expulsion of ethnic Han cadres in Xinjiang to eastern China. Hu was purged in 1987 for a series of demonstrations that he is said to have provoked in other areas of China. The prominent Xinjiang and national official [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]] criticized Hu for destroying Xinjiang Han cadres' "sense of security", and for exacerbating ethnic tensions.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=53}}

In the 1990s, there was a net inflow of Han people to Xinjiang, many of whom were previously prevented from moving because of the declining number of social services tied to ''[[hukou system|hukou]]'' (residency permits).{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=56}} As of 1996, 13.6% of Xinjiang's population was employed by the publicly traded [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]] (''Bingtuan'') corporation. 90% of the ''Bingtuan'''s activities relate to agriculture, and 88% of ''Bingtuan'' employees are Han, although the percentage of Hans with ties to the ''Bingtuan'' has decreased.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=242}} Han emigration from Xinjiang has also resulted in an increase of minority-identified agricultural workers as a total percentage of Xinjiang's farmers, from 69.4% in 1982 to 76.7% in 1990.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=246}} During the 1990s, about 1.2 million temporary migrants entered Xinjiang every year to stay for the [[cotton]] picking season.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=257}} Many Uyghur trading communities exist outside of Xinjiang; the largest in Beijing is one village of a few thousand.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=257}}

In 2000, Uyghurs "comprised 45 per cent of Xinjiang's population, but only 12.8 per cent of Urumqi's population." Despite having 9% of Xinjiang's population, Urumqi accounts for 25% of the region's GDP, and many rural Uyghurs have been migrating to that city to seek work in the dominant [[Light industry|light]], [[Heavy industry|heavy]], and [[petrochemical]] industries.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=178–179}} Hans in Xinjiang are demographically older, better-educated, and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur cohabitants. Hans are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Urumqi, while some Uyghurs also cite trouble with the law back home and family reasons for their moving to Urumqi.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=184}} Hans and Uyghurs are equally represented in Urumqi's [[floating population]] that works mostly in commerce. [[Self-segregation]] within the city is widespread, in terms of residential concentration, employment relationships, and a social norm of [[endogamy]].{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=187–188}} As of 2010, Uyghurs constitute a majority in the Tarim Basin, and a mere plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=11}}

Han and Hui mostly live in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="China Census"&gt;{{cite report |author=Department of Population, Social, Science and Technology Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (国家统计局人口和社会科技统计司) and Department of Economic Development of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China (国家民族事务委员会经济发展司), eds. |trans-title=Tabulation on Nationalities of 2000 Population Census of China |script-title=zh:《2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料》 |location=Beijing |publisher=Nationalities Publishing House |date=2003 |isbn=7-105-05425-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tabulation_on_nationalities_of_2000_popu.html?id=xWpLAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the declarations of independence of the constituent republics of the area of Central Asia([[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, calls for the liberation of East Turkestan from China began to surface again from many in the Turkic population. {{Citation needed|reason=24 February 2009|date=March 2009}}

Those that use the term ''Uyghurstan'' tend to envision a state for the [[Uyghur people]]. Those groups that adopt this terminology tended to be allied with the [[Soviet Union]] while it still existed (Indeed, Russia incited and aided the rebellion in attempt to annex these regions in the future). Since then some of the leaders of these groups have remained in Russia, [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Kyrgyzstan]], or have emigrated to Europe and North America. It is worth noting that none of these identities are exclusive. Some groups support more than one such orientation. It is common to support both an Islamic and Turkic orientation for Xinjiang, for example, the founders of independent Republic in [[Kashgar]] in 1933 used names ''Turkic Islamic Republic of East Turkestan'' and ''Eastern Turkestan Republic'' the same time.

Since 1995 the Chair of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] has been [[Erkin Alptekin]], the son of the Uyghur leader [[Isa Alptekin|Isa Yusuf Alptekin]].

==Uyghur views by oasis==
Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turpan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]]. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=31}} Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-Chinese region. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|Central Asia Monitor|1993|p=19}} In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Mackerras|2003|p=118}} Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan soften the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children.{{sfn|Svanberg|Westerlund|2012|p=202}}{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=81}} Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca are encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979–1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=129}} Han, Hui, and the Chinese government are viewed much more positively by Uyghurs specifically in Turpan, with the government providing better economic, religious, and political treatment for them.{{sfn|Svanberg|Westerlund|2012|p=205}} There were 20,000 mosques representing a 5.8 times of increase in total in Xinjiang in 1989.&lt;ref name="SmithFinley2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finley |first1=Joanne N.

In Xinjiang, Communist Party members and civil servants who are employees of the government are not allowed to participate in religious activities while ordinary private citizens are allowed to practice religion and fast in Ramadan, students in public government directed schools are discouraged from participating in religious activities but not banned from doing so, the policy pertains to all religions-  members of the Communist party are not allowed to carry out [[Daoist]] practices like [[Feng Shui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=zh:陈杰人：中国新疆的"斋月之冤" |trans-title=Chen Jie: China's Xinjiang "Ramadan injustice" | language = zh-hans |work=zaobao.csg |url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/special/zbo/commentary/story20150714-502856 |date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Diplomat'' reported that although Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and that therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang likely reflects "not a distaste for Islam as such, but it is an absolute neurosis towards the threat – serious or not – of territory loss, and with no small degree of xenophobia thrown in there as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/a-tale-of-two-chinese-muslim-minorities/|title=A Tale of Two Chinese Muslim Minorities|last=Crane|first=Brent|date=22 August 2014|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt; China banned a book titled ''Xing Fengsu'' (''Sexual Customs'') which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |title=Muslim Chinese: ethnic nationalism in the People's Republic |publisher=Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University |date=1991 |p=2 |isbn=978-0-674-59496-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcsmAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Louisa |last=Schein |title=Minority Rules: The Miao and the Feminine in China's Cultural Politics |publisher=Duke University Press |date=2000 |p=154 |isbn=978-0-8223-2444-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |chapter=Alterity Motives |editor-first1=Pál |editor-last1=Nyíri |editor-first2=Joana |editor-last2=Breidenbach |title=China Inside Out: Contemporary Chinese Nationalism and Transnationalism |publisher=Central European University Press |date=2005 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA257 |p=257 |isbn=978-963-7326-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |chapter=The Salafiyya Movement in Northwest China: Islamic Fundamentalism among the Muslim Chinese? |editor-first=Leif |editor-last=Manger |title=Muslim Diversity: Local Islam in Global Contexts |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |p=144 |isbn=978-1-136-81857-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Sautman |chapter=Legal Reform and Minority Rights in China |editor-first=Stuart |editor-last=Nagel |title=Handbook of Global Legal Policy |publisher=CRC Press |date=2000 |p=79 |isbn=978-0-8247-7892-7 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH94dPJrkA4C&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIWC9wCX2c8C&amp;pg=PA581 |title=China: A History |first=Harold Miles |last=Tanner |year=2009 |publisher=Hackett |page=581 |isbn=0-87220-915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.{{sfn|Gladney|2004|p=232}}

{{main|Ili Rebellion|Second East Turkestan Republic|Xinjiang conflict}}

The Soviet Union supported the Uyghur [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] in the [[Ili Rebellion]] against the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. According to her autobiography, ''Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace with China'', [[Rebiya Kadeer]]'s father served with pro-Soviet Uyghur rebels under the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] in the [[Ili Rebellion]] (Three Province Rebellion) in 1944–1946, using Soviet assistance and aid to fight the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].{{sfn|Kadeer|2009|p=9}} Kadeer and her family were close friends with [[Russians in China|White Russian exiles]] living in Xinjiang and Kadeer recalled that many Uyghurs thought Russian culture was "more advanced" than that of the Uyghurs and they "respected" the Russians a lot.{{sfn|Kadeer|2009|p=13}}

Many of the Turkic peoples of the [[Yining County|Ili region]] of Xinjiang had close cultural, political, and economic ties with Russia and then the Soviet Union. Many of them were educated in the Soviet Union and a community of Russian settlers lived in the region. As a result, many of the Turkic rebels fled to the Soviet Union and obtained Soviet assistance in creating the Sinkiang Turkic People's Liberation Committee (STPNLC) in 1943 to revolt against [[Kuomintang]] rule during the [[Ili Rebellion]].{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=173}} The pro-Soviet Uyghur who later became leader of the revolt and the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]], [[Ehmetjan Qasim]], was Soviet educated and described as "Stalin's man".{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=174}}

The Soviet Union incited separatist activities in Xinjiang through propaganda, encouraging Kazakhs to flee to the Soviet Union and attacking China. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han [[Bingtuan]] militia and farmers.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=138}} The Soviets massively intensified their broadcasts inciting Uyghurs to revolt against the Chinese via Radio Tashkent since 1967 and directly harbored and supported separatist guerilla fighters to attack the Chinese border, in 1966 the amount of Soviet sponsored separatist attacks on China numbered 5,000.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=139}} The Soviets transmitted a radio broadcast from Radio Tashkent into Xinjiang on 14 May 1967, boasting of the fact that the Soviets had supported the Second East Turkestan Republic against China.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=188}} In addition to Radio Tashkent, other Soviet media outlets aimed at disseminating propaganda towards Uyghurs urging that they proclaim independence and revolt against China included Radio Alma-Ata and the Alma-Ata published ''Sherki Türkistan Evazi'' ("The Voice of Eastern Turkestan") (شەرقىي تۈركىستان ئاۋازى) newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Dickens |title=The Soviets in Xinjiang: 1911–1949 |publisher=Oxus Communications |date=1990 |url=http://www.oxuscom.com/sovinxj.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in 1962, over 60,000 Uyghurs and Kazakhs [[Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang|defected from Xinjiang]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], in response to [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] which promised Xinjiang independence. Uyghur exiles later threatened China with rumors of a Uyghur "liberation army" in the thousands that were supposedly recruited from Sovietized emigres.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=141–142}}

The Soviet Union was involved in funding and support to the [[East Turkestan People's Revolutionary Party]] (ETPRP), the largest militant Uyghur separatist organization in its time, to start a violent uprising against China in 1968.{{sfn|Dillon|2003|p=57}}{{sfn|Clarke|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Dillon|2008|p=147}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=China's Search for Security |first1=Andrew James |last1=Nathan |first2=Andrew |last2=Scobell |edition=illustrated |year=2013 |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=etRkjLv8AosC&amp;pg=PT278 |isbn=0-231-51164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the Soviets also supported the [[United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan]] (URFET) to fight against the Chinese.{{sfn|Reed|Raschke|2010|p=37}}

The Soviet Union supported Uyghur nationalist propaganda and Uyghur separatist movements against China.

Uyghur nationalist historian [[Turghun Almas]] and his book [[Uyghurlar]] (The Uyghurs) and Uyghur nationalist accounts of history were galvanized by Soviet stances on history, "firmly grounded" in Soviet Turcological works, and both heavily influenced and partially created by Soviet historians and Soviet works on Turkic peoples.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=42}} Soviet historiography spawned the rendering of Uyghur history found in Uyghurlar.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=33}} Almas claimed that Central Asia was "the motherland of the Uyghurs" and also the "ancient golden cradle of world culture".{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=4}}

A chain of aggressive and belligerent press releases in the 1990s making false claims about violent insurrections in Xinjiang, and exaggerating both the number of Chinese migrants and the total number of Uyghurs in Xinjiang were made by the former Soviet supported URFET leader Yusupbek Mukhlisi.{{Sfn|Wayne|2007|p=46}}{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=341}}

After the establishment of the Soviet Union, many Uyghurs who studied in Soviet Central Asia added Russian suffixes to Russify their surnames and make them look Russian.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=115}} Urban Uyghurs sometimes select Russian names when naming their children, in cities such as [[Qaramay]] and [[Urumqi]].{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=117}}

== Attempts at independence ==

===Yaqub Beg establishment of Kashgaria===
The Kokandi [[Yaqub Beg]] invaded Kashgar during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)|Dungan revolt]] to establish an independent state after taking advantage of local rebellions.

Also during the Dungan revolt, the [[Taranchi]] Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang initially cooperated with the Dungans (Chinese Muslims) when they rose in revolt, but turned on them, because the Dungans, mindful of their Chinese heritage attempted to subject the entire region to their rule. The Taranchi massacred the Dungans at [[Yining (city)|Kuldja]] and drove the rest through Talk pass to the Ili valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gitcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA35&amp;dq=soviets+defeated+by+tungans#v=snippet&amp;q=tungans%20taranchis%20massacred%20kuldja&amp;f=false|title=Accounts and papers of the House of Commons|author=Great Britain.

===First East Turkestan Republic===
The first republic established by the Uighurs was short lived, the Uighur army was defeated by the [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]], which destroyed the Republic at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]].

===Second East Turkestan Republic===
A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] backed state was created by Uighur rebels in northern Xinjiang. It was absorbed into the newly founded People's Republic of China in 1950.

Dear Brother,&lt;br&gt;
With all due respect to your previous position in the Government of Sinkiang and to the confidence placed in you by His Excellency the President of the Republic of China, I hope that you will refrain from using expressions which should not be used by one who occupied the position of a mufti. We are all serving our beloved country trying to do our best for our countrymen. I also hope that you will refrain from using the expression "The Turkestani Nation" which was the creation of one Abdul Qayyum Khan while he was living in Germany. We are working for the welfare of the true people of Sinkiang not for the Turkestanis living outside Sinkiang or the followers of Abdul Qayyum Khan.&lt;br&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br&gt;

==Infighting between Uyghur separatists==

[[Anwar Yusuf Turani]] set up the "East Turkistan Government in Exile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastturkistangovernmentinexile.us |title=The Government-in-Exhile of East Turkistan Republic |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkic nationalism ==
During the [[First East Turkestan Republic]], the Turkic nationalist ideology of the Republic led to hostility between different Muslim ethnic groups. The Uyghurs and Kirghiz, who were both Turkic Muslim peoples, fought against the [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]]s of southern Xinjiang and sought to expel them with the [[Han Chinese]]. This led several [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] Generals like [[Ma Zhancang]], [[Ma Fuyuan]], and [[Ma Hushan]] to fight against the Uyghur attempts and independence.

The Chinese Hui Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] wanted to settle disbanded Chinese soldiers in Xinjiang, which the Uyghurs opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 |title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937 |first=Diana |last=Lary |year=1974 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=124 |isbn=0-521-20204-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uyghur American Association claims that Many Uyghurs face religious persecution and discrimination at the hands of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] authorities. Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can use only a state-approved version of the Koran;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/directive-08142008114700.html|title=Crackdown on Xinjiang Mosques, Religion|date=14 August 2008|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claims that many nationalists are killed or tortured or jailed for their independence efforts, and even non-violent protesters have said to have been facing human rights abuses. They claim dress, language, and culture are slowly being eroded away as more and more ethnic Han are moving there in the [[Migration to Xinjiang]]. They claim religion and way of life are misunderstood and the government cracks down on any sign of resistance.

==Argument against East Turkestan independence==

[[People's Republic of China|China]] claims to have a historic claim on modern-day [[Xinjiang]] dating back two thousand years. East Asian migrants arrived in the eastern portions of the [[Tarim Basin]] about 3,000 years ago, while the [[Uighur people]] arrived after the collapse of the Orkon Uighur Kingdom, based in modern-day [[Mongolia]], around the year 842.&lt;ref name="Celtic" /&gt; It fears that independence movements are largely funded and led by outside forces that seek to weaken China. China points out that despite such movements, [[Xinjiang]] has made great economic strides, building up its infrastructure, improving its education system and increasing the average life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;China White Paper on Xinjiang 26 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] criticize Uyghur separatism, and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries over Islam for fear of being perceived as radical.&lt;ref name="Van Wie Davis 2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China |last=Van Wie Davis |first=Elizabeth |work=Asian Affairs |volume=35 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2008 |pp=15–29 |jstor=27821503 |doi=10.3200/aafs.35.1.15-30|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA493744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region, yet the historical native land of the Uyghurs is not the whole land of Xinjiang, but [[Tarim basin]]. Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the capital of Xinjiang [[Urumqi]] was even originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city, but foreigners mistakenly think that Urumqi was originally a Uyghur city and that the Chinese destroyed its Uyghur character and culture.{{sfn|Millward|1998|pp=77–78, 133–134}} Moreover, the Han and Hui mostly live in northern Xinjiang [[Dzungaria]], and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="China Census"/&gt; While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of Urumqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760–1830 were all in Dzungaria and Urumqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=23}}

Uyghur nationalist historians such as [[Turghun Almas]] claim that Uyghurs were distinct and independent from Chinese for 6000 years, and that all non-Uyghur peoples are non-indigenous immigrants to Xinjiang.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25, 30–31}} However, the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) established military colonies ([[tuntian]]) and commanderies ([[duhufu]]) to control Xinjiang from 120 BCE, while the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) also controlled much of Xinjiang until the [[An Lushan rebellion]].{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25–26}} Chinese historians refute Uyghur nationalist claims by pointing out the 2000-year history of Han settlement in Xinjiang, documenting the history of [[Mongols in China|Mongol]], [[Kazakh people|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Xibo people|Xibo]] indigenes in Xinjiang, and by emphasizing the relatively late "westward migration" of the [[Huigu]] (equated with "Uyghur" by the PRC government) people from Mongolia the 9th century.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25, 30–31}} The name "Uyghur" was associated with a Buddhist people in the Tarim Basin in the 9th century, but completely disappeared by the 15th century, until it was revived by the [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=28}}

Uyghur nationalists often incorrectly claim that 5% of Xinjiang's population in 1949 was Han, and that the other 95% was Uyghur, erasing the presence of [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]], [[Xibe people|Xibes]], and others, and ignoring the fact that Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population at 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=197}} At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"/&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they [[Zunghar genocide|exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols]] in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.{{sfn|Starr|2004}}

==Groups==
[[File:Flag of Jihad.svg|thumb|The flag of [[Jihad]] is used by the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]].]]

In general, the wide variety of groups who seek independence can be distinguished by the type of government they advocate and the role they believe an independent East Turkestan should play in international affairs. Groups who use the term ''East Turkestan'' tend to have an orientation towards western Asia, the [[Islamic world]], and Russia. These groups can be further subdivided into those who desire [[secularism]], and identify with the struggle of secular [[Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]], versus those who want an [[Islam]]ic [[theocracy]] and identify with [[Saudi Arabia]], the former [[Taliban]] government in Afghanistan, or [[Iran]]. In many cases the latter diminish the importance or deny the existence of a separate [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] ethnicity and claim a larger Islamic identity. These groups tend to see an independent East Turkestan in which non-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and especially non-Islamic minorities, such as the [[Han Chinese]] would play no significant role.

Some of the groups that support independence for East Turkestan have been labeled [[terrorist organization]]s by both the People's Republic of China, the [[United Nations]] and/or the United States. Pro-independence organizations overseas include the [http://etnfc.org East Turkistan National Freedom Center], the [[East Turkistan Government in Exile]], and the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]] (Transnational [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Devastating Blows: Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang |section=Background |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=April 2005 |url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/china0405/4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable event towards the East Turkistan Independence Movement was the establishment of the East Turkistan Government in Exile by a group of East Turkistani immigrants led by [[Anwar Yusuf Turani]] in Washington D.C. on 14 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-a-2004-09-21-3-China-67507892.html |title=China Protests Establishment of Uighur Government-in-Exile in Washington – 2004-09-21 |date=29 October 2009 |work=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target audience of these organizations is generally the Western governments and public, as almost none of the websites are in Chinese or Uyghur, and most Uyghurs in China and Central Asia have never heard of them.{{sfn|Gladney|2004|pages=246–247}} The [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]] (ETIM, also East Turkestan Islamic Party), which has claimed responsibility for attacks in Xinjiang, has been identified as a terrorist organization by the governments of China, [[Kazakhstan]], Pakistan and the United States, as well as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=cody&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050900478.html |title=China demands that Albania return ex-U.S. detainees |first=Edward |last=Cody |work=Washington Post |date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2007/103706.htm |title=Country Reports: East Asia and Pacific Overview |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan025885.htm |title=Governance Asia-Pacific Watch |author= |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=April 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2007/specrep3aug2007.htm |title=The New Face of Jihad |work=News Line |first=Massoud |last=Ansari |date=August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610031612/http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2007/specrep3aug2007.htm |archivedate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/45388.htm |title=Country Reports |publisher=United States Department of State |date=27 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent events==
There continues to be concern over tensions in the region, centering upon Uyghur [[Uyghur people#Culture|cultural aspirations]] to independence, and resentment towards what [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] describe as repression of non-[[Han Chinese culture]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Conversely, many [[Han Chinese]] perceive PRC policies of ethnic autonomy as discriminatory against them (see [[autonomous entities of China]]). Independence advocates view Chinese rule in Xinjiang, and policies like the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]] as [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Chinese imperialism]]. The US and the UN have labelled the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]] a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist group]].

The tensions have occasionally resulted in major incidents and violent clashes during the PRC period. For example, in 1962, 60,000 Uyghur and Kazakh refugees fled northern Xinjiang into the [[Soviet Union]] to escape the famine and political purges of the [[Great Leap Forward]] era; in the 1980s there was a smattering of student demonstrations and riots against police action that took on an ethnic aspect; and the [[Baren Township riot]] in April 1990, an abortive uprising resulted in more than 50 deaths.

A police roundup of suspected separatists during [[Ramadan]] resulted in large demonstrations that turned violent in February 1997 in an episode known as the [[Ghulja Incident]] that led to at least 9 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/china-bck1017.htm |title=China: Human Rights Concerns in Xinjiang |work=Human Rights Watch Backgrounder |date=17 October 2001 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urumqi bus bombs]] of 25 February 1997, perhaps a response to the crackdown that followed the Ghulja Incident, killed 9 and injured 68. Speaking on separatist violence, Erkin Alptekin, a former East Turkestan National Congress chairman and prominent Uyghur [[activist]], said "We must emphasise dialogue and warn our youth against the use of violence because it de-legitimises our movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Manolis |last=Priniotakis |url=http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=chinas_secret_separatists |title=China's Secret Separatists: |work=The Prospect |date=19 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite much talk of separatism and terrorism in Xinjiang, especially after the [[11 September 2001 attacks|9-11 attacks]] in the United States and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], the situation in Xinjiang was quiet from the late nineties through mid-2006. In 2005, Uighur author [[Nurmemet Yasin]] was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for inciting separatism following his publication of an allegorical short story, "The Blue Pigeon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/china-battles-to-convince-terror-sceptics/2005/11/11/1131578236193.html?page=3 |title=China battles to convince terror sceptics |first=Hamish |last=McDonald |date=12 November 2005 |work=The Age |archivedate=30 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330143209/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/china-battles-to-convince-terror-sceptics/2005/11/11/1131578236193.html?page=3 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2007 the Chinese Public Security Bureau raided a suspected [[terrorist training camp]] in the mountains near the Pamir Plateau in southern Xinjiang. According to the reports, 18 terrorists were killed and another 17 captured in a gun battle between the East Turkestan Independence Movement and PRC forces. One police officer was killed and "over 1,500 hand grenades... were seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese police destroy terrorist camp in Xinjiang, one policeman killed |publisher=China Central Television |date=10 January 2007 |url=http://www.cctv.com/english/20070110/100828.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Turkiye-uyghur.jpg|thumb|320x320px|China protest in Turkey in 2015]]

===Olympics===
In 2008, the Chinese government announced that several terrorist plots by Uyghur separatists to disrupt the [[2008 Olympic Games]] involving kidnapping athletes, journalists and tourists were foiled. The security ministry said 35 arrests were made in recent weeks and explosives had been seized in Xinjiang province. It said 10 others were held when police smashed another plot based in Xinjiang back in January to disrupt the Games. However, Uyghur activists accused the Chinese of fabricating terror plots to crack down on the people of the region and prevent them airing legitimate grievances.
Some foreign observers were also skeptical, questioning if China was inflating a terror threat to justify a clampdown on dissidents before the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China 'foils Olympic terror plot' |date=10 April 2008 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7340181.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, during which world attention was drawn by pro-Tibet protests along the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]], Uyghur separatist groups staged protests in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|E4Jnwks3h6s|Uyghurs protest Olympic Torch in Istanbul - NTDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chinese government, a suicide bombing attempt on a China Southern Airlines flight in Xinjiang was thwarted in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth Van Wie |last=Davis |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JD18Ad01.html |title=China confronts its Uyghur threat |work=Asia Times |date=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days before the Beijing Olympics, 16 Chinese police officers were killed and 16 injured in an [[2008 Kashgar attack|attack]] in [[Kashgar]] by local merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080804.wchinaraid0804/BNStory/International/ |title=16 Chinese police officers killed in attack |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=4 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chinese police injured and damaged the equipment of two Japanese journalists sent to cover the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/07/olympics.press.freedom.florcruz/?iref=mpstoryview |publisher=CNN |title=Behind the scenes: Internet police out in force for the Olympics |date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later a bombing in [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]] killed at least two people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL986830 |title=Blasts kill two in China's restive Xinjiang |agency=[[Xinhua]] |publisher=Reuters |date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, two Chinese police officers were killed and seven more wounded near the city of [[Kashgar]] when their patrol was [[ambush]]ed by at least seven militants, including one woman, wielding knives and automatic weapons. Apparently the patrol was lain upon in a corn field while acting on an erroneous tip from another woman that had been suspected of assisting militants. According to Uighur sources Chinese officials have been "cracking down" on ethnic Uighurs, detaining large numbers in recent weeks and view the incident as Uighurs resisting arrest. Reportedly, 33 people died in Xinjiang because of clashes in the month of August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080828/ap_on_re_as/china_uighur_clash_4 |accessdate=29 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080829/wl_asia_afp/chinaxinjiangunrestoly2008_080829153907 |accessdate=29 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|July 2009 Ürümqi riots}}
On 5 July 2009, [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots|riots broke out in Ürümqi]], the capital of Xinjiang. The state media reported close to 150 people dead. While the riots occurred after a demonstration protesting the deaths of two Uyghurs in the [[June 2009 Shaoguan incident]], the central government claimed that the riot had been masterminded by separatists abroad, particularly exiled leader [[Rebiya Kadeer]].

=== 2015 Bangkok bombing ===
The [[2015 Bangkok bombing]] is suspected to have been carried out by the [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] neo-fascist [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish ultra-nationalist]] organization [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] due to Thailand's deportation of Uyghur terrorist suspects back to China instead of allowing them to travel to Turkey for asylum, a Turkish man named Adem Karadag was arrested by the Thai police in connection to the bombing with Turkish passports and bomb making materials found in his apartment, the Grey Wolves are described by the media as a terrorist group and became famous for their assassinations and killings of journalists, liberals, and leftists in Turkey, their member [[Mehmet Ali Ağca]]'s [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II]], and their involvement in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and the [[First Chechen War|Chechen war]] due to the Muslim and Turkic populations of those areas since their aim is the unification of all Muslim Turkic peoples into one state spanning from Central Asia to the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sherwell |first=Philip |date= 29 August 2015 |title=Bangkok bombing: Was it the Grey Wolves of Turkey? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/11832701/Bangkok-bombing-Was-it-the-Grey-Wolves-of-Turkey.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murdoch  |first=Lindsay |date=30 August 2015  |title=Bangkok bombing: Who are the Turkish terrorist group the Grey Wolves? |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/bangkok-bombing-who-are-the-turkish-terrorist-group-the-grey-wolves-20150830-gjavjz.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rossington  |first=Ben |date= 27 August 2015  |title= Bangkok bombings: Police probe 'Grey Wolves' link to attack which killed 20 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/bangkok-bombings-police-probe-grey-6334814 |work=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham  |first=Susan |date=24 August 2015  |title=Thailand's Shrine Bombing - The Case For Turkey's Grey Wolves |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susancunningham/2015/08/24/thailands-shrine-bombing-the-case-for-turkeys-grey-wolves/ |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 August 2015 |title= Break in Bangkok blast case?
