'''17th century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him.  The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &amp;mdash;  philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].  The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience.  Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]].  Thus, while philosophers still talked about &amp;ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &amp;ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought.  (In the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">The '''alphabet of human thought''' is a concept originally proposed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] that provides a universal way to represent and analyze ideas and relationships by breaking down their component pieces. All ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which can be represented by a unique character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|series=International Cognitive Linguistics Conference (1 : 1989 : Duisburg) |editor-last=Geiger |editor-first=Richard A. |editor2-first= Brygida |editor2-last=Rudzka-Ostyn|title=Conceptualizations and mental processing in language|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1993|pages=25–26|isbn=978-3-11-012714-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunnin|first=Nicholas|author2=Jiyuan Yu|title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|pages=715|isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and the Universal Language ==
Logic was Leibniz's earliest philosophic interest going back to his teens. [[René Descartes]] had suggested that the [[lexicon]] of a [[universal language]] should consist of primitive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatfield|first1=Gary|title=René Descartes, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/descartes/|website=plato.stanford.edu|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=12 July 2014|quote=he offered a new vision of the natural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world of matter possessing a few fundamental properties and interacting according to a few universal laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic combination of these elements, according to syntactical rules, would generate the infinite combinations of computational structures required to represent human language. In this way Descartes and Leibniz were precursors to computational linguistics as defined by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521658225|pages=425–428|edition=Kindle|quote=I mentioned that modern generative grammar has sought to address concerns that animated the tradition; in particular, the Cartesian idea that "the true distinction" (Descartes 1649/1927: 360) between humans and other creatures or machines is the ability to act in the manner they took to be most clearly illustrated in the ordinary use of language: without any finite limits, influenced but not determined by internal state, appropriate to situations but not caused by them, coherent and evoking thoughts that the hearer might have expressed, and so on. The goal of the work I have been discussing is to unearth some of the factors that enter into such normal practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century, Leibniz outlined his ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', an artificial language in which [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[logic]]al structure would coincide, which would allow  reasoning to be reduced to calculation. Leibniz acknowledged the work of [[Ramon Llull]], particularly the ''Ars generalis ultima'' (1305), as one of the inspirations for this idea. The basic elements of his ''characteristica'' would be pictographic characters representing unambiguously a limited number of elementary concepts. Leibniz called the inventory of these concepts "the alphabet of human thought." There are quite a few mentions of the ''characteristica'' in Leibniz's writings, but he never set out any details save for a brief outline of some possible sentences in his ''Dissertation on the Art of Combinations''.

His main interest was what is known in modern logic as classification and composition. In modern terminology Leibniz's alphabet was a proposal for an [[automated theorem prover]] or [[Hierarchical classifier|ontology classification reasoner]] written centuries before the technology to implement them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=L.J.|title= The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volumes 3 and 4|year=1985|publisher=Macmillan Publishing|asin=B0017IMQME|pages=422–423 |editor=Paul Edwards|chapter=Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm|quote=his main emphasis... was on classification, deduction was a natural consequence of combining classified items into new classes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semantic web implementation ==
[[John Giannandrea]], co-founder and CTO of [[Metaweb|Metaweb Technologies]], acknowledged in a speech that [[Freebase]] was at least linked to the alphabet of human thought, if not an implementation of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PARCForum Presentation by Giannandrea, J.|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa__x-wUKWw|website = YouTube|accessdate = 2015-10-30|at = min 37+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

'''Armchair theorizing''', '''armchair philosophizing''', or '''armchair scholarship''' is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nadel|1956|p=173}}, who defines ''armchair anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commentary and analysis ==
Different disciplines place different weight on purely theoretical research. Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]] argue that purely theoretical anthropological research is outdated and that [[ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] should be a necessary part of anthropological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ingold|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some commentators argue that [[economic theory|economic theories]] are designed to explain and predict economic phenomena, which requires analysis and synthesis, and not necessarily collection, of data.  [[Leland B. Yeager]] even argues that economists can legitimately extrapolate from their own personal observations to design new theories.  In this sense, Yeager sees armchair theorizing as something better than the "mere sterile juggling of arbitrary assumptions" saying that "it can have a sound empirical basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469376/pg_9 Henry George and Austrian economics - History of Thought], ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', Dec, 2001  by [[Leland B. Yeager]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While armchair scholarship contrasts with the [[scientific method]], which inherently involves the active investigation of the nature through data collection, armchair philosophers and theorizers can assist in formulating theories that explain observations; these theories can then be tested with further scientific investigation. While the methods of the armchair philosopher are different from those of the scientist, they can complement each other to produce new insights and discover necessary truths, whether they are empirical or theoretical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Biofacticity''' is a philosophical concept that allows to identify a living [[Object (philosophy)|object]] as a so-called [[Biofact (philosophy)|biofact]], i.e. a semi-natural living entity which has been biotechnically interfered during its life-span such as [[transgenic]] plants or cloned organisms. In [[philosophy]], [[sociology]] and the [[arts]], a biofact stands in close relation to the anthropological concept of the human being a composite of [[nature]] and [[technology]]. Biofact was introduced to philosophy as a [[neologism]] in 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]] and fuses the words [[Artifact_(archaeology)|artifact]] and the prefix "bio". One of Karafyllis' thesis is that a technical change in living objects, i.e. an increase in biofacticity, will shift the anthropological concept of hybridity towards a technological self-definition of the human.

== Biofacticity vs. hybridity ==
Hybridity takes into account the anthropological fact that humans are hybrid with both natural and technical essences, making them designers with an individual "''Leib''," which is a term in phenomenology that denotes subjectivity of one's own [[Corporeal substance|corporeality]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tensions and Convergences: Technological And Aesthetic Transformations of Society|last=Heil|first=Reinhard|last2=Kaminski|first2=Andreas|last3=Stippak|first3=Marcus|last4=Unger|first4=Alexander|last5=Ziegler|first5=Marc|publisher=Transcript|year=2007|isbn=9783899425185|location=Bielefeld|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofacticity, on the other hand, is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] term that reflects upon the anthropological term of [[hybridity]]. The latter deals with the self-definition of subjects rather than objects. Hybridity, thus, is an anthropological concept particularly when used for philosophical purposes while biofacticity is an epistemological concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Today's Science and Technology: A German-Chinese Approach|last=Poser|first=Hans|last2=Li|first2=Wenchao|publisher=LIT Verlag Munster|year=2008|isbn=9783825813635|location=Berlin|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these concepts demonstrate the hybrid character of the human being as a growing and creative entity who acts in light of self-determined ends. Theorists cite that this view becomes a broad approach in understanding the idea of life not merely as a biological process or functions of the [[Gene|genetic]] code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">'''Bracketing''' ({{lang-de|Einklammerung}}; also called '''phenomenological reduction''') is a term in the philosophical movement of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] describing the act of suspending judgment about the natural world to instead focus on analysis of experience.

==Overview==
Phenomenology, developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938), can be understood as an outgrowth of the influential ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804). Attempting to resolve some of the key intellectual debates of his era, Kant argued that ''[[Noumenon|Noumena]]'' (fundamentally unknowable things-in-themselves) must be distinguished from ''[[Phenomenon|Phenomena]]'' (the world as it appears to the mind). Kant, commonly misconceived as arguing that humans cannot have direct access to [[Reality#Western philosophy|reality]], but only to the [[Mental content|contents of their minds]], argued rather that what is experienced in the mind is reality. Phenomenology grew out of this conception of phenomena, and studies the meaning of isolated phenomena as directly connected to our minds. According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, "Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied."&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/phenomenon |title=Phenomenon |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be possible if observation is [[theory-ladenness|theory laden]].

Bracketing (or ''epoché'') is a preliminary act in the phenomenological analysis, conceived by Husserl as the suspension of the trust in the objectivity of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves setting aside the question of the real existence of a contemplated object, as well as all other questions about the object's physical or objective nature; these questions are left to the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851394087|title=Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology|last=Husserl|first=Edmund|date=|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=1977|isbn=9789400999978|location=Dordrecht|pages=20-21|oclc=851394087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the act of seeing a horse qualifies as an experience, whether one sees the horse in person, in a dream, or in a hallucination. 'Bracketing' the horse suspends any judgement about the horse as ''noumenon'', and instead analyses the ''phenomenon'' of the horse as constituted in intentional acts.

Bracketing may also be understood in terms of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] activity it is supposed to make possible:  the "unpacking" of phenomena, or, in other words, systematically peeling away their symbolic meanings like layers of an onion until only the thing itself as meant and experienced remains. Thus, one's subjective intending of the bracketed phenomenon is examined and analyzed in phenomenological purity.

'''Byzantinism''', or '''Byzantism''', is the political system and culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its spiritual successors, in particular, the Christian [[Balkan]] states ([[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]]) and Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and most importantly, [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name=dim3&gt;Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe'', in Dimitris Keridis, [[Ellen Elias-Bursać]], Nicholas Yatromanolakis, ''New approaches to Balkan studies'', Brassey's, 2003, {{ISBN|1-57488-724-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim11&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''byzantinism'' itself was coined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=dim8&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has primarily negative associations, implying complexity and [[autocracy]].

This negative reputation stressed the confusing complexities of the Empire's [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|ministries]] and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies. Likewise, the "Byzantine system" also suggests a penchant for intrigue, plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs. The term has been criticized by modern scholars for being a [[generalization]] that is not very representative of the reality of the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name=dim6&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.17–18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristocracy and bureaucracy==
{{Main|Byzantine bureaucracy}}

The [[Byzantine Empire]] is a modern term applied by Westerners to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (that survived a thousand years after the western one collapsed in 476) and thus had a complex system of [[aristocracy]] and [[bureaucracy]] which was derived from earlier [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems. At the apex of the pyramid stood the [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]], sole ruler and divinely ordained, and beneath him a multitude of officials and court functionaries operated the administrative machinery of the state. A key component of state power was the prestige of the Imperial institution and its long antiquity. Ceremony and the granting of both honorific titles and valuable offices was therefore extensive and elaborate.

Over the nearly fifteen hundred years of the empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. By the time of [[Heraclius]] in the 7th century many of the early Roman titles, grounded in the Latin language and the traditions of the old Roman republic had become obsolete in the now mostly Greek-speaking empire, although Latin survived longer in law and in the military. Heraclius formally changed the official language to Greek from Latin in 620. Titles inspired by their Greek tradition, often only rough approximation of Latin concepts, became common (i.e. "basileus" [βασιλεύς] instead of "caesar" or "augustus" for the title of the emperor himself). Other titles changed meaning (for example, "Patriarch") or were devalued with time (such as "consul").

Among important qualities of the Empire was also the [[caesaropapism]], the subjugation of church to the state.&lt;ref name=dim4-5&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[Byzantine Empire]] acquired a negative reputation in the [[Western world]] as early as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim7&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and the [[East–West Schism]] in the 11th century made the Empire an outcast to the Western European countries following the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], and the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege and sack of Constantinopole]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 only cemented those differences.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt; Hence the European medieval stereotypes of the people of the Byzantine Empire portrayed them as perfidious, treacherous, servile, effeminate and unwarlike.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt;

Medievalist [[Steven Runciman]] described the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]an view of the Byzantine Empire by saying:
{{quote|Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw [[Constantinople]] and met, to their contemptuous disgust, a society where everyone read and wrote, ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war, it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence.|[[Steven Runciman]], ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', 1988&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-521-35722-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHVzWN6gqxQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Ever+since+our+rough+crusading+forefathers+first+saw%22&amp;ei=Xp8JSseLL4SSzQSa2LH4Cw Google Print, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Criticism of the Empire continued among historians of the 18th century and 19th century, particularly in the works of historians and philosophers influenced by [[The Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[William Lecky]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]] were among the many Western writers of that period who were critical of the Byzantine system.&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford history of Byzantium'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-814098-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6-kHUyyUIsC&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=Edward+Gibbon+decadent+Byzantium&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=tqgJSr3kAqG2zQTqzeiQDw Google Print, p.v]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Of that Byzantine empire, the universal verdict of history is that it constitutes, without a single exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed.

[[Edward Gibbon]], the first English historian to write a full [[history of the Byzantine Empire]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–1789), was a sharp critic of the Empire.&lt;ref name=dim9&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Burckhardt]], an influential 19th-century historian shared Gibbon's view:

{{quote|At its summit was despotism, infinitely strengthened by the union of churchly and secular dominion; in the place of morality it imposed orthodoxy; in the place of unbridled and demoralized expression of the natural instincts, hypocrisy and pretense; in the face of despotism there was developed greed masquerading as poverty, and deep cunning; in religious art and literature there was an incredible stubbornness in the constant repetition of obsolete motifs.|[[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''The age of Constantine the Great''&lt;ref name=dim10&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;vq=stubbornness&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics pointed out that the Byzantine Empire and its successors were uninfluenced by such major shifts in Western philosophy as the [[Investiture Controversy]], the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Renaissance]];&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt; and reduced the Byzantine political culture to [[caesaropapism]] and authoritarian political culture, described as [[authoritarian]], [[despotism|despotic]], and [[imperialist]]ic.&lt;ref name=dim9/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim10/&gt;

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, critics of the Byzantine system pointed out that it has survived and "corrupted" other states, in particular, it has been used in the discourse of the political system, culture and society of the [[Russia]] (from the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] through the [[tsardom of Russia]] to the [[Russian Empire]] – see also [[tsarist autocracy]]),&lt;ref name=dim11/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim12&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=dim13&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.13]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balkan]] states (the former European [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]]).&lt;ref name=dim3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians point out that this negative reputation is not necessarily true, and at the very least, a very simplistic [[generalization]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718/&gt; As a [[social constructivism|constructed term]], Byzantinism also shares those fallacies with a closely related term, [[Balkanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Angelov sums it up as follows:

{{quote|Byzantinism begins from simple stereotypes, passes through [[reductionism]] and [[essentialization]], and then proceeds to impute Byzantium's supposed essence onto modern Balkans or Russia as the burden of history. ... As a discourse of "otherness", Byzantinism evolves from, and reflects upon, the West's worst dreams and nightmares about its own self.|Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe''&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.13–14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Praise==
While the Byzantine Empire was commonly seen in a negative fashion, there were exceptions. Byzantium was rehabilitated in France during the [[Age of Absolutism]], from the 17th century to the [[French Revolution]], in the works of such individuals as the [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Poussines]].&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;

As the Enlightenment swept Western Europe, French traditions found refuge in the [[Russian Empire]]. The term Byzantinism was used in a positive context by 19th-century Russian scholar [[Konstantin Leontiev]] in ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875) to describe the type of society which [[Russian Empire]] needs to counter the [[liberalism|degenerating influence]] of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref name=dim12/&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-12269-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1yCrMAfg_IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, pp.148–149]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev praised the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[tsarist autocracy]], and a society and political system that comprises authoritative power of the monarch, devout following of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the maintenance of [[obshchina]] for peasants, and sharp class division; he also criticized [[universal education]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=pipes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

{{quote|When we mentally picture Byzantinism we see before us as if... the austere, clear plan of a spacious and capacious structure. We know, for example, that in politics it means autocracy. In religion, it means Christianity with distinct features, which distinguish it from Western churches, from heresies and schisms. In the area of ethics we know that the Byzantine ideal does not have that elevated and in many instances highly exaggerated notion of terrestrial human individual introduced into history by German feudalism. We know the inclination of the Byzantine ethical ideal to be disappointed in all that is of this world, in happiness, in the constancy of our own purity, in our capacity here, below, to attain complete moral perfection. We know that Byzantinism (as Christianity in general) rejects all hope of the universal well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of humanity in the sense of universal worldly equality, universal worldly freedom, universal worldly perfectibility, and universal contentment. |[[Konstantin Leontiev]], ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875)}}

In Russian political discourse, Russia is sometimes affectionately called ''[[Third Rome]]'', the second Rome being the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlived its western counterpart at Rome itself, the first Rome, by a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Raphael Johnson, ''The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism and Orthodoxy'', The Foundation for Economic Liberty, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9742303-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Pavlov, ''[http://www.eusanz.org/pdf/conf02/pavlov_eusanz_2002.pdf The new Third Rome?

In his article, "Was There Ever Byzantinism?" Alexander Mirkovic argued that many Western authors have created an imagined picture of Byzantium as a projection of their own anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108000000/http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |archivedate=2018-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Calculus ratiocinator''''' is a theoretical universal logical calculation framework, a concept described in the writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], usually paired with his more frequently mentioned ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', a universal conceptual language.

==Two views==
There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by ''calculus ratiocinator''. The first is associated with [[computer software]], the second is associated with [[computer hardware]].

=== The analytic view ===
*The received point of view in [[analytic philosophy]] and formal [[logic]], is that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' anticipates [[mathematical logic]]&amp;mdash;an "algebra of logic".&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley-Sander 1982: p.164&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic point of view understands that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is a formal [[inference engine]]&lt;!--what makes an inference engine formal or informal--&gt; or [[computer program]], which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s writings on logic in the 1880s. [[Frege]] intended his "concept script" to be a ''calculus ratiocinator'' as well as a ''[[lingua characteristica]]''. That part of formal logic relevant to the calculus comes under the heading of [[proof theory]]. From this perspective the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is only a part (or a subset) of the ''[[universal characteristic]]'', and a complete ''universal characteristic'' includes a "logical calculus".

=== The synthetic view ===
*A contrasting point of view stems from [[Herbert Spencer#Synthetic philosophy|synthetic philosophy]] and fields such as [[cybernetics]], [[electronic engineering]] and [[general systems theory]]. It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as referring to a "calculating machine". The cybernetician [[Norbert Wiener]] considered Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator'' a forerunner to the modern day digital computer:

{{cquote|The history of the modern computing machine goes back to Leibniz and Pascal. Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator''. (Wiener 1948: 214)}}

{{cquote|...like his predecessor Pascal, [Leibniz] was interested in the construction of computing machines in the Metal. ... just as the [[calculus of arithmetic]] lends itself to a mechanization progressing through the abacus and the desk computing machine to the utra-rapid computing machines of the present day, so the ''calculus ratiocinator'' of Leibniz contains the germs of the ''[[machina ratiocinatrix]]'', the reasoning machine (Wiener 1965: 12)}}

Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a [[Stepped Reckoner]]. As a computing machine, the ideal ''calculus ratiocinator'' would perform Leibniz's integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, "ratiocinator" is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as "an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the characteristica universalis, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science" (Hartley Rogers, Jr. 1963; p.&amp;nbsp;934).

A classic discussion of the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is Couturat (1901: chapters 3 and 4), who maintained that the ''characteristica universalis''—and thus the ''calculus ratiocinator''—were inseparable from Leibniz's encyclopedic project (chapter 5). Hence the ''characteristic'', ''calculus ratiocinator'', and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibniz's project.

P. Blavatsky and The secret doctrine'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1971, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the theosophical idea of God, which involves the negation of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rudolf Steiner in Britain: A Documentation of His Ten Visits, 1902-25, Volume 1|last=Villeneuve|first=Crispian|publisher=Temple Lodge Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781906999032|location=Forest Row, UK|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is described as the central point from which all emerges and around and toward which all gravitates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theosophy brings the wisdom of love before the eye of the soul: Philosophical Keys to the Secret Doctrine.|last=Blatavsky|first=Helena|publisher=Philaletheians UK|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Causeless cause is synonymous with '[[Absolute (philosophy)|the absolute]],' which '[[Logos|Proto-logos]]' is often confused with, but it is not: 'first' denotes finite bound, but causeless cause is unbounded. There are numerous other descriptions such as how it is also equated to the form of the absolute Being and Non-Being, or the "great Architect and to concepts such as [[Agape|Divine Love]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and pure awareness or "consciousness at rest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yoga For Stress Management|last=Venkatkrishnan|first=Sri|publisher=Peacock Books|year=2008|isbn=9788124801833|location=New Delhi|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanatana Dharma|Hindus]] and Theosophists call it [[Para Brahman]] (Parabrahm). Formless Parabrahm is said to periodically emanate [[Logos|Logoi]], which are hence not causeless, but are non-eternal except in cycles of emanation, existence, [[pralaya]] (dissolution). In each cycle, causeless cause causes the Logoic [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] to move into action, which develops into the Logoic triad/[[triple manifestation]], and the heptad (i.e. seven; [[prajapatis]] (Devas) or [[Elohim]]) which continue the cosmic chain of cause and effect. It has been shown the causeless cause is so described in some religious cosmogenesis accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''Doxography''' ({{lang-el|δόξα}} - "an opinion", "a point of view" + {{lang|el|γράφειν}} - "to write", "to describe") is a term used especially for the works of [[classical antiquity|classical]] historians, describing the points of view of past [[philosopher]]s and [[scientist]]s. The term was coined by the German classical scholar [[Hermann Alexander Diels]].

== Classic Greek philosophy ==

A great many philosophical works have been lost; our limited knowledge of such lost works comes chiefly through the doxographical works of later philosophers, commentators, and biographers.  Philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] also act as doxographers, as their comments on the ideas of their predecessors indirectly tell us what their predecessors' beliefs were.  Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Defense of Socrates]]'', for example, tells us much of what we know about the natural philosophy of [[Anaxagoras]].

== Islamic doxography ==

Islamic doxography is an aggregate of theosophical works (like ''[[Kitab al-Maqalat]]'' by  [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]]) concerning the aberrations in Islamic sects and streams.

The '''dream argument''' is the postulation that the act of dreaming provides preliminary evidence that the [[sense]]s we trust to distinguish [[reality]] from [[illusion]] should not be fully trusted, and therefore, any state that is dependent on our senses should at the very least be carefully examined and rigorously tested to determine whether it is in fact reality.

== Synopsis ==
{{Descartes}}
While one [[dream]]s, one does not normally [[lucid dreaming|realize]] one is dreaming. This has led [[philosophy|philosophers]] to wonder whether it is possible for one ever to be [[certainty|certain]], at any given point in time, that one is not in fact dreaming, or whether indeed it could be possible for one to remain in a perpetual dream state and never experience the reality of [[wakefulness]] at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the [[Western philosophy|West]], this philosophical puzzle was referred to by [[Plato]] ([[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']] 158b-d) and [[Aristotle]] ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] 1011a6). Having received serious attention in [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', the dream [[Logical argument|argument]] has become one of the most prominent [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This type of argument is sometimes referred to as the "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly|Zhuangzi paradox]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman—how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.&lt;ref&gt;莊子, 齊物論, 12. ''Zhuàngzi'', "Discussion on making all things equal," 12. ''from'' Zhuàngzi, Burton Watson trans., ''Chuang Tzu'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996), 43. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10595-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1BvUUUVRLEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first philosophers to posit the dream argument formally was the [[Yogachara]] philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] (4th to 5th century C.E.) in his "[[Twenty verses on appearance only]]." 

The dream argument came to feature prominently in [[Mahayana]] and [[Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy. Some [[reality in Buddhism|schools of thought ]] (''e.g.'', [[Dzogchen]]) consider ''perceived [[reality]]'' to be literally unreal. As [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream . . . ."&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only [[visual perception]]s, but also appearances perceived through all [[sense]]s, including [[hearing|sounds]], [[Odour|smell]]s, [[taste]]s, and [[touch|tactile sensations]], and [[mental operations|operations]] on perceived mental objects.

== Hutton's paradox ==

A paradox concerning dreams and the nature of reality was described by the British writer Eric Bond Hutton in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Adversaria V," ''Write Justified'', Spring 1989. For Hutton's definitive statement on the subject see "Hutton's Paradox," ''Fortean Times'', April 2015, archived online [https://archive.org/stream/Fortean_Times_April_2015_UK#page/n71/mode/2up here].&lt;/ref&gt; As a child Hutton often had [[lucid dream|lucid dreams]], in which everything seemed as real as in waking life. This led him to wonder whether life itself was a dream, even whether he existed only in somebody else's dream. Sometimes he had [[pre-lucid dream|pre-lucid dreams]], in which more often than not he concluded he was awake. Such dreams disturbed him greatly, but one day he came up with a magic formula for use in them: "If I find myself asking 'Am I dreaming?' it proves I am, for the question would never occur to me in waking life." Yet, such is the nature of dreams, he could never recall it when he needed to. Many years later, when he wrote a piece about solipsism and his childhood interest in dreams, he was struck by a contradiction in his earlier reasoning. True, asking oneself "Am I dreaming?" ''in a dream'' would seem to prove one is. Yet that is precisely what he had often asked himself in waking life. Therein lay a paradox. What was he to conclude? That it does not prove one is dreaming? Or that life really is a dream?

== Simulated reality ==
{{See also|Simulated reality|Simulation hypothesis}}

Dreaming provides a springboard for those who question whether our own reality may be an illusion. The ability of the mind to be tricked into believing a mentally generated world is the "real world" means at least one variety of simulated reality is a common, even nightly event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bttg3B5CZOIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dreaming+simulated+reality&amp;ots=iPQG-evOVr&amp;sig=_7NT_42ES4XXK8iXz02Necg5W9c#PPA103,M1 ''Joseph Barbera, Henry Moller'', Dreaming, Virtual Reality, and Presence].&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who argue that the world is not simulated must concede that the mind—at least the sleeping mind—is not itself an entirely reliable mechanism for attempting to differentiate reality from illusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WD0-45MGTWX-N&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=23fdaaef820b1ccd4be0982568286789 ''Giuliana A. L. Mazzoni and Elizabeth F. Loftus'', When Dreams Become Reality].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| Whatever I have accepted until now as most true has come to me through my senses. But occasionally I have found that they have deceived me, and it is unwise to trust completely those who have deceived us even once.|||René Descartes&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfbits/dm1.pdf Meditations on First Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Critical discussion ==
In the past, philosophers [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] have separately attempted to refute Descartes's account of the dream argument. Locke claimed that you cannot experience pain in dreams. Various scientific studies conducted within the last few decades provided evidence against Locke's claim by concluding that pain in dreams can occur but the pain isn't as severe{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Philosopher Ben Springett has said that Locke might respond to this by stating that the agonising pain of stepping in to a fire is non-comparable to stepping in to a fire in a dream. Hobbes claimed that dreams are susceptible to absurdity while the waking life is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dreaming/#SH1b|title=Dreaming, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers have attempted to refute dream skepticism in detail (see, e.g., Stone (1984)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Jim|year=1984|title=Dreaming and Certainty|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=45|issue=3|pages=353–368|doi=10.1007/BF00355443|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/STODAC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Sosa]] (2007) devoted a chapter of a monograph to the topic, in which he presented a new theory of dreaming and argued that his theory raises a new argument for skepticism, which he attempted to refute. In ''A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge'', he states: "in dreaming we do not really believe; we only make-believe."&lt;ref&gt;Sosa, Ernest (2007). A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-929702-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Ichikawa (2008) and Nathan Ballantyne &amp; Ian Evans (2010) have offered critiques of Sosa's proposed solution. Ichikawa argued that as we cannot tell whether our beliefs in waking life are truly beliefs and not imaginings, like in a dream, we are still not able to tell whether we are awake or dreaming.

[[Norman Malcolm]] in his monograph "Dreaming" (published in 1959) elaborated on Wittgenstein's question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams "really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking".  He argues that the sentence "I am asleep" is a senseless form of words; that dreams cannot exist independently of the waking impression; and that scepticism based on dreaming "comes from confusing the historical and dream telling senses...[of]...the past tense". (page 120).  In the chapter: "Do I Know I Am Awake ?" he argues that we do not have to say: "I know that I am awake" simply because it would be absurd to deny that one is awake.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecotechnics''' is defined as the '[[techne]]' of bodies. Ecotechnics thinks of the body as a technology which makes possible the inclusion of a whole new range of bodies. This gives people more agency and [[biopower]] over their own use of their bodies. This makes it usable for [[queer theory]] and [[disability studies]]. The term is then also central in Sullivan's and Murray's collection of essays ''Queering the Technologisation of Bodies''. It is built on [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s work that sees the body and technology as a double process: the technology and the body are informed by each other. [[Derrida]] who extends on both Jean-Luc Nancy and Stiegler's ideas argues that the 'proper body' implicates interconnections of technical additions. Ecotechnics goes against the [[essentialist]] and binary notion of the body as a technological object which positions it within [[post-structuralism]]. The body can only be understood within its environment and this environment is a technical one.

'''Endoxa''' ({{lang-el|ἔνδοξα}}) derives from the word ''[[doxa]]'' (δόξα, meaning "beliefs", "opinions"). Whereas [[Plato]] condemned ''doxa'' as a starting point from which to attain truth, [[Aristotle]] used the term ''endoxa''{{spaced ndash}}in the sense of "commonplace", "everyday", "consensus"{{spaced ndash}}to identify a group or population's beliefs that had previously withstood debate and argument (and were, thereby, more stable than ''doxa'').

Examples of Aristotle's use of ''endoxa'' may be found in the ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics][Book I 1 100b18 Loeb Classical Library #391 p. 273]]'' of the ''[[Organon]]'' and in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Otfried Höffe, translated by Christine Salazar, offers a detailed discussion of the topic in "Aristotle" (2003; {{pp.|35|42}}).

It is one of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[virtues]], the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|"golden mean"]] between boorishness (ἀγροικία) and buffoonery (βωμολοχία). Later on it came to mostly signify jokes that were obscene and coarse.

The '''Rationality Debate'''—also called the '''Great Rationality Debate'''—is the question of whether humans are [[rationality|rational]] or not. This issue is a topic in the study of [[cognition]] and is important in fields such as [[economics]] where it is relevant to the theories of [[market efficiency]].

Many studies in [[experimental psychology]] have shown that humans often [[reason]] in a way that is inaccurate or imperfect—that they do not naturally chose the ideal method or solution.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=356}} An example of a problem which causes difficulty and debate is the [[St. Petersburg paradox]].{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=360}} This is a lottery which is constructed so that the [[expected value]] is infinite but unlikely so that most people will not pay a large fee to play. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] explained that, in this case, mathematicians refined their formulae to model this pragmatic behaviour.{{sfn|Gigerenzer|1991|p=21}} [[Keith Stanovich]] characterizes this as a [[Panglossian]] position in the debate—that humans are fundamentally rational and any variance between the [[normative]] position and empirical outcomes may be explained by such adjustments.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=361}}

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">'''Henology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἕν ''hen'', "one") refers to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] account or discourse on "The One" that appears most notably in the philosophy of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAYh3Aeem5YC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Henology#PPA118,M1 Four ages of Understanding at Google Books] Retrieved on May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reiner Schürmann]] describes it as a "metaphysics of radical [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]" that extends beyond [[being]] and intellection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schürmann|first1=Reiner|last2=Lily|first2=Reginald|title=Broken Hegemonies|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=0-253-34144-2|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eRv1DTW_KoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Henology#v=onepage&amp;q=Henology&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be contrasted with [[ontology]], as ontology is "an account of being" whereas henology is an "account of unity."

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

'''The heroic theory of invention and scientific development''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the principal authors of [[invention]]s and [[scientific discoveries]] are unique [[hero]]ic individuals{{spaced ndash}} "great scientists" or "geniuses."  A competing hypothesis ("[[multiple discovery]]") is that most inventions and scientific discoveries are made independently and simultaneously by multiple inventors and scientists.

The multiple discovery hypothesis might be especially relevant in the development of mathematics since mathematical knowledge is highly unified and any advances that happen need to be built from previously established results through a process of deduction, as a general rule.  For instance, the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] into a systematic discipline did not occur until the development of [[analytic geometry]], the former being credited to both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and the latter to both [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60113">The '''history of philosophy in Poland''' parallels the evolution of [[philosophy]] in [[Europe]] in general.  

==Overview==
Polish philosophy drew upon the broader currents of European philosophy, and in turn contributed to their growth.  Among the most momentous Polish contributions were made, in the thirteenth century, by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher and scientist [[Witelo]], and, in the sixteenth century, by the [[Renaissance]] [[polymath]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] partook in the intellectual ferment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which for the multi-ethnic Commonwealth ended not long after the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] and political annihilation that would last for the next 123 years, until the collapse of the three partitioning empires in [[World War I]].

The period of [[Messianism]], between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], reflected European [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Idealist]] trends, as well as a Polish yearning for political [[resurrection]].  It was a period of [[maximalist]] [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]].

The collapse of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] prompted an agonizing reappraisal of Poland's situation.  Poles gave up their earlier practice of "measuring their resources by their aspirations," and buckled down to hard work and study.  "[A] Positivist," wrote the novelist [[Bolesław Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]], was "anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century brought a new quickening to Polish philosophy.  There was growing interest in western philosophical currents.  Rigorously trained Polish philosophers made substantial contributions to specialized fields—to [[psychology]], the [[history of philosophy]], the [[theory of knowledge]], and especially [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 32"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and his "[[Polish notation]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', pp. 23–24, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Tarski]]'s work in [[truth theory]] won him world renown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', p. 30 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], for over four decades, world-class Polish philosophers and [[history of philosophy|historians of philosophy]] such as [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] continued their work, often in the face of adversities occasioned by the dominance of a politically enforced official philosophy.
The [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Roman Ingarden]] did influential work in [[esthetics]] and in a [[Husserl]]-style [[metaphysics]]; his student [[Karol Wojtyła]] acquired a unique influence on the world stage as Pope [[John Paul II]].

==Scholasticism==
{{col-begin}}
[[File:Witelo-Perspectiva.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Page from a manuscript of ''De perspectiva'', with miniature of its author [[Witelo]]]]
[[File:Witelo, book.gif|thumb|150px|Cover of ''Vitellonis Thuringopoloni opticae libri decem'' (Ten Books of Optics by the [[Thuringia|Thuringo]]-[[Poland|Pole]] [[Witelo]])]]
The formal history of [[philosophy]] in [[Poland]] may be said to have begun in the fifteenth century, following the revival of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]] by King [[Jagiello|Władysław II Jagiełło]] in 1400.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true beginnings of Polish philosophy, however, reach back to the thirteenth century and [[Witelo]] (c. 1230&amp;nbsp;– c. 1314), a [[Silesia]]n born to a Polish mother and a [[Thuringia]]n settler, a contemporary of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who had spent part of his life in [[Italy]] at centers of the highest intellectual culture.  In addition to being a [[philosopher]], he was a [[scientist]] who specialized in [[optics]].  His famous treatise, ''Perspectiva'', while drawing on the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Book of Optics]]'' by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], was unique in [[Latin]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn helped inspire [[Roger Bacon]]'s best work, Part V of his ''Opus maius'', "On Perspectival Science," as well as his supplementary treatise ''On the Multiplication of Vision''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''The Age of Faith'', p. 1011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Witelo's ''Perspectiva'' additionally made important contributions to [[psychology]]:  it held that [[visual perception|vision]] ''per se'' apprehends only [[color]]s and [[light]] while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of [[association (psychology)|association]] and unconscious [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5"/&gt;

Witelo's concept of [[being]] was one rare in the [[Middle Ages]], neither [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] as among conservatives nor [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] as among progressives, but [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]]. It was an [[emanationism|emanationist]] concept that held [[radiation]] to be the prime characteristic of being, and ascribed to radiation the nature of [[light]].  This "metaphysic of light" inclined Witelo to [[optics|optical]] research, or perhaps ''vice versa'' his optical studies led to his [[metaphysic]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Polish historian of philosophy, [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], no Polish philosopher since [[Witelo]] has enjoyed so eminent a European standing as this thinker who belonged, in a sense, to the [[prehistory]] of Polish philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Collegium Maius in Krakow 01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Courtyard of [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]'s ''Collegium Maius'', a site of Polish higher learning since 1400]]
From the beginning of the fifteenth century, Polish philosophy, centered at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], pursued a normal course. It no longer harbored exceptional thinkers such as Witelo, but it did feature representatives of all wings of mature [[Scholasticism]], ''via antiqua'' as well as ''via moderna''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

The first of these to reach Kraków was ''via moderna'', then the more widespread movement in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[physics]], [[logic]] and [[ethics]], [[Terminism]] ([[Nominalism]]) prevailed in Kraków, under the influence of the [[France|French]] Scholastic, [[Jean Buridan]] (died c. 1359), who had been [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Paris]] and an exponent of views of [[William of Ockham]].  Buridan had formulated the [[theory]] of "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''"—the [[force]] that causes a body, once set in [[Motion (physics)|motion]], to persist in motion—and stated that impetus is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[speed]] of, and amount of [[matter]] comprising, a body:  Buridan thus anticipated [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton]].  His theory of impetus was momentous in that it also explained the motions of [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] without resort to the [[spirit]]s—''"intelligentiae"''—to which the [[Peripatetics]] (followers of [[Aristotle]]) had ascribed those motions.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, pp. 303–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Kraków]], physics was now expounded by (St.) [[John Cantius|Jan Kanty]] (1390–1473), who developed this concept of "impetus."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

A general trait of the Kraków [[Scholastics]] was a provlivity for [[compromise]]—for reconciling [[Nominalism]] with the older tradition. For example, the Nominalist, Benedict Hesse, while in principle accepting the theory of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]], did not apply it to the heavenly spheres.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

In the second half of the fifteenth century, at Kraków, ''via antiqua'' became dominant. [[Nominalism]] retreated, and the old [[Scholasticism]] triumphed.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311"/&gt;

In this period, [[Thomism]] had its chief center at [[Cologne]], whence it influenced Kraków.  Cologne, formerly the home ground of [[Albertus Magnus]], had preserved Albert's mode of thinking.  Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] traits characteristic of Albert, affirming [[emanation]], a [[hierarchy]] of [[being]], and a [[metaphysic]] of [[light]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;
[[File:Jan z Głogowa.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Jan of Głogów]]]]
The chief Kraków adherents of the Cologne-style Thomism included [[Jan of Głogów]] (c. 1445 – 1507) and [[Jakub of Gostynin]] (c. 1454 – 1506).  Another, purer teacher of Thomism was [[Michał Falkener]] of [[Wrocław]] (c. 1450 – 1534).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost at the same time, [[Scotism]] appeared in Poland, having been brought from [[Paris]] first by [[Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków]] (c. 1450 – 1520).  Twaróg had studied at Paris in 1473–77, in the period when, following the [[anathema]]tization of the [[Nominalist]]s (1473), the Scotist school was there enjoying its greatest triumphs.  A prominent student of Twaróg's, [[Jan of Stobnica]] (c. 1470 – 1519), was already a moderate Scotist who took account of the theories of the [[William of Ockham|Ockhamists]], [[Thomist]]s and [[Humanism|Humanists]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Nominalism]] was revived in [[western Europe]] at the turn of the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (''Faber Stapulensis''), it presently reappeared in [[Kraków]] and began taking the upper hand there once more over [[Thomism]] and [[Scotism]].  It was reintroduced particularly by Lefèvre's pupil, [[Jan Szylling]], a native of Kraków who had studied at Paris in the opening years of the sixteenth century.  Another follower of Lefèvre's was [[Grzegorz of Stawiszyn]], a Kraków professor who, beginning in 1510, published the Frenchman's works at Kraków.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7"/&gt;

Thus [[Poland]] had made her appearance as a separate philosophical center only at the turn of the fifteenth century, at a time when the creative period of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy had already passed.  Throughout the fifteenth century, Poland harbored all the currents of Scholasticism.  The advent of [[Humanism]] in Poland would find a Scholasticism more vigorous than in other countries.  Indeed, Scholasticism would survive the 16th and 17th centuries and even part of the 18th at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] and [[Wilno University|Wilno Universities]] and at numerous [[Jesuit]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be sure, in the sixteenth century, with the arrival of the [[Renaissance]], [[Scholasticism]] would enter upon a decline; but during the 17th century's [[Counter-reformation]], and even into the early 18th century, Scholasticism would again become Poland's chief philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of [[Humanism]], which had reached Poland by the middle of the fifteenth century, was not very "philosophical." Rather, it lent its stimulus to [[linguistics|linguistic]] studies, [[political]] thought, and [[science|scientific]] research. But these manifested a philosophical attitude different from that of the previous period.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empirical]] [[natural science]] had flourished at [[Kraków]] as early as the fifteenth century, side by side with speculative philosophy. The most perfect product of this blossoming was [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543, {{lang-pl|Mikołaj Kopernik}}). He was not only a scientist but a philosopher. According to [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], he may have been the greatest—in any case, the most renowned—philosopher that Poland ever produced. He drew the inspiration for his cardinal discovery from philosophy; he had become acquainted through [[Marsilio Ficino]] with the philosophies of [[Plato]] and the [[Pythagoreans]]; and through the writings of the philosophers [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]] he had learned about the [[ancient history|ancients]] who had declared themselves in favor of the Earth's movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XVIII, no. 3, 1973, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus may also have been influenced by Kraków philosophy:  during his studies there, [[Terminism|Terminist]] [[physics]] had been taught, with special emphasis on "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''."  His own thinking was guided by philosophical considerations.  He arrived at the [[heliocentric]] thesis (as he was to write in a youthful treatise) "''ratione postea equidem sensu''":  it was not [[observation]] but the discovery of a [[logic]]al [[contradiction]] in [[Ptolemy]]'s system, that served him as a point of departure that led to the new astronomy.  In his dedication to [[Pope Paul III]], he submitted his work for judgment by "philosophers."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its turn, Copernicus' theory transformed man's view of the structure of the [[universe]], and of the place held in it by the earth and by man, and thus attained a far-reaching philosophical importance.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

Copernicus was involved not only in [[natural science]] and [[natural philosophy]] but also—by his postulation of a [[quantity theory of money]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus, memorandum on monetary policy, 1517.&lt;/ref&gt; and of "[[Gresham's Law]]" (in the year, 1519, of [[Thomas Gresham]]'s birth&lt;ref&gt;"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at [[Olsztyn]] in 1519.  He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at [[Grudziądz]]...  He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528."  Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;)—in the philosophy of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

In the early sixteenth century, [[Plato]], who had become a model for philosophy in [[Italy]], especially in [[Medici|Medicean]] [[Florence]], was represented in [[Poland]] in some ways by [[Adam of Łowicz]], author of ''Conversations about Immortality''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

Generally speaking, though, Poland remained [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]. [[Sebastian Petrycy]] of [[Pilzno]] (1554–1626) laid stress, in the [[theory of knowledge]], on [[experiment]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]; and in [[psychology]], on [[feeling]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]; while in [[politics]] he preached [[democracy|democratic]] ideas. Petrycy's central feature was his linking of philosophical theory with the requirements of practical national life. In 1601–18, a period when [[translation]]s into [[modern language]]s were still rarities, he accomplished Polish translations of [[Aristotle]]'s practical works. With Petrycy, [[vernacular]] Polish philosophical [[terminology]] began to develop not much later than did the French and German.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another [[Renaissance]] current, the new [[Stoicism]], was represented in Poland by [[Jakub Górski]] (c. 1525 – 1585), author of a famous ''Dialectic'' (1563) and of many works in [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[theology]] and [[sociology]].  He tended toward [[eclecticism]], attempting to reconcile the [[Stoics]] with [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later, purer representative of [[Stoicism]] in Poland was [[Adam Burski]] (c. 1560 – 1611), author of a ''Dialectica Ciceronis'' (1604) boldly proclaiming Stoic [[sensationalism|sensualism]] and [[empiricism]] and—before [[Francis Bacon]]—urging the use of [[inductive reasoning|inductive method]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10"/&gt;

A star among the [[Pleiades|pleiade]] of progressive [[political]] philosophers during the [[Polish Renaissance]] was [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] (1503–72), who advocated on behalf of [[social equality|equality]] for all before the law, the accountability of [[monarch]] and [[government]] to the nation, and social assistance for the weak and disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  His chief work was ''De Republica emendanda'' (On Reform of the Republic, 1551–54).

Another notable political thinker was [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] (1530–1607), best known in Poland and abroad for his book ''De optimo senatore'' (The Accomplished Senator, 1568).  It propounded the view—which for long got the book banned in [[England]], as subversive of [[monarchy]]—that a ruler may legitimately govern only with the sufferance of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Kasparek|Joseph Kasparek]], ''The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States:  Kinships and Genealogy'', pp. 245–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first decades of the 17th century, the [[war]]s, [[invasion]]s and internal [[wikt:dissension|dissension]]s that beset the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], brought a decline in philosophy.  If in the ensuing period there was independent philosophical thought, it was among the religious [[dissenter]]s, particularly the Polish [[Polish Brethren|Arians]],&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; also known variously as [[Antitrinitarian]]s, [[Socinian]]s, and [[Polish Brethren]]—forerunners of the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[United States|American]] Socinians, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deist]]s who were to figure prominently in the intellectual and political currents of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, ''The Constitutions...'', pp. 218–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish [[dissenter]]s created an original [[ethical]] theory radically condemning evil and [[violence]].  Centers of intellectual life such as that at [[Leszno]] hosted notable thinkers such as the [[Czech people|Czech]] [[pedagogue]], [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (Comenius), and the Pole, [[Jan Jonston]].  Jonston was tutor and physician to the [[Leszczyński]] family, a devotee of Bacon and experimental knowledge, and author of ''Naturae constantia'', published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1632, whose [[geometrical]] method and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]], almost [[pantheistic]] concept of the world may have influenced [[Benedict Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/&gt;

The [[Leszczyński]] family itself would produce an 18th-century [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] king, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] (1677–1766; reigned in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] 1704–11 and again 1733–36), "''le philosophe bienfaisant''" ("the beneficent philosopher")—in fact, an independent thinker whose views on [[culture]] were in advance of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s, and who was the first to introduce into Polish intellectual life on a large scale the [[France|French]] influences that were later to become so strong.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689, in an exceptional miscarriage of justice, a Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher, [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], author of a manuscript treatise, ''De non existentia Dei'' (On the Non-existence of God), was accused of atheism by a priest who was his debtor, was convicted, and was executed in most brutal fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnlIAAAAMAAJ|title=Historical sketch of the rise, progress, and decline of the Reformation in Poland: and of the influence which the scriptural doctrines have exercised on that country in literary, moral, and political respects|first=Valerian Krasinski|last=(Count)|date=23 May 2018|publisher=Printed for the author and sold by Murray|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The execution of the nobleman Lyszczynski, accused of atheism, [a] religious murder ordered by the Diet of 1689, remained an isolated case."

After a decline of a century and a half, in the mid-18th century, Polish philosophy began to revive.  The hub of this movement was [[Warsaw]].  While Poland's capital then had no institution of higher learning, neither were those of [[Kraków]], [[Zamość]] or [[Vilnius|Wilno]] any longer agencies of progress.  The initial impetus for the revival came from religious thinkers:  from members of the [[Piarist]] and other teaching orders.  A leading patron of the new ideas was [[Bishop]] [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/&gt;

[[Scholasticism]], which until then had dominated Polish philosophy, was followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  Initially the major influence was [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and, indirectly, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s [[Royal elections in Poland|elected]] king, [[August III the Saxon]], and the relations between Poland and her neighbor, [[Saxony]], heightened the [[Germany|German]] [[Sphere of influence|influence]].  Wolff's doctrine was brought to Warsaw in 1740 by the [[Theatine]], Portalupi; from 1743, its chief Polish champion was [[Wawrzyniec Mitzler de Kolof]] (1711–78), court physician to [[August III]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s last king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (reigned 1764–95), the [[Polish Enlightenment]] was radicalized and came under [[France|French]] influence.  The philosophical foundation of the movement ceased to be the [[Rationalist]] doctrine of Wolff and became the [[Sensationalism|Sensualism]] of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]].  This spirit pervaded Poland's [[Commission of National Education]], which completed the reforms begun by the [[Piarist]] priest, [[Stanisław Konarski]].  The Commission's members were in touch with the French [[Encyclopedists]] and [[Freethought|freethinkers]], with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Condorcet]], [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]].  The Commission abolished school instruction in [[theology]], even in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[empiricist]] and [[positivist]] Enlightenment philosophy produced several outstanding Polish thinkers.  Though active in the reign of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], they published their chief works only after the loss of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s independence in 1795.  The most important of these figures were [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another adherent of this empirical Enlightenment philosophy was the minister of education under the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and under the [[Congress Poland]] established by the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Stanisław Kostka Potocki]] (1755–1821).  In some places, as at [[Krzemieniec]] and its [[Lyceum]] in southeastern Poland, this philosophy was to survive well into the nineteenth century.  Though a belated philosophy from a western perspective, it was at the same time the philosophy of the future.  This was the period between [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]; and even as this variety of [[positivism]] was temporarily fading in the West, it was carrying on in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the nineteenth century, as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fame was spreading over the rest of Europe, in Poland the Enlightenment philosophy was still in full flower.  Kantism found here a hostile soil.  Even before Kant had been understood, he was condemned by the most respected writers of the time:  by [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic|Staszic]], [[Hugo Kołłątaj|Kołłątaj]], [[Tadeusz Czacki]], later by [[Anioł Dowgird]] (1776–1835). [[Jan Śniadecki]] warned against this "fanatical, dark and apocalyptic mind," and wrote:  "To revise [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], to desire ''a priori'' knowledge of things that human nature can grasp only by their consequences, is a lamentable aberration of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Śniadecki's younger brother, however, [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]], was the first respected Polish scholar to declare (1799) for Kant.  And in applying Kantian ideas to the [[natural sciences]], he did something new that would not be undertaken until much later by [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]], [[Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz]] and other famous scientists of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Polish proponent of Kantism was [[Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski]] (1764–1843), who had been a student of Kant's at [[Königsberg]].  But, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of [[Idealism]].  Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the antimetaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, Kant's foremost Polish sympathizer would be [[Feliks Jaroński]] (1777–1827), who lectured at Kraków in 1809–18.  Still, his Kantian sympathies were only partial.  And this half-heartedness was typical of Polish Kantism generally.  In Poland there was no actual Kantian period.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a generation, between the age of the [[French Enlightenment]] and that of the Polish national [[metaphysic]], the Scottish philosophy of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|common sense]] became the dominant outlook in Poland.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] held sway in most European countries—in Britain till mid-century, and nearly as long in France.  But in Poland, from the first, the Scottish philosophy fused with Kantism, in this regard anticipating the West.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kantian and Scottish ideas were united in typical fashion by [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]] (1768–1838).  The younger brother of [[Jan Śniadecki]], Jędrzej was an illustrious scientist, biologist and physician, and the more creative mind of the two.  He had been educated at the universities of [[Kraków]], [[Padua]] and [[Edinburgh]] and was from 1796 a professor at [[Wilno]], where he held a chair of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacy]].  He was a foe of [[metaphysics]], holding that the fathoming of [[first cause]]s of [[being]] was "impossible to fulfill and unnecessary."  But foe of metaphysics that he was, he was not an [[Empiricist]]—and this was his link with Kant.  "Experiment and observation can only gather... the materials from which [[common sense]] alone can build science."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogous position, shunning both [[positivism]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical speculation]], affined to the Scots but linked in some features to Kantian [[critique]], was held in the period before the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] by virtually all the university professors in Poland:  in [[Wilno]], by Dowgird; in [[Kraków]], by [[Józef Emanuel Jankowski]] (1790–1847); and in [[Warsaw]], by [[Adam Ignacy Zabellewicz]] (1784–1831) and [[Krystyn Lach Szyrma]] (1791–1866).&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, following a generation imbued with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, Poland passed directly to a [[maximalism|maximalist]] philosophical program, to absolute [[metaphysics]], to [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|syntheses]], to great [[system]]s, to [[reform]] of the world through philosophy; and broke with [[positivism]], the doctrines of the Enlightenment, and the precepts of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish metaphysical blossoming occurred between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], and stemmed from the spiritual aspirations of a politically humiliated people.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

The Poles' metaphysic, though drawing on [[Germany|German]] [[Idealism]], differed considerably from it; it was [[Spiritualist]] rather than Idealist.  It was characterized by a [[theistic]] belief in a personal [[God]], in the immortality of [[soul]]s, and in the superiority of spiritual over corporeal forces.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

The Polish metaphysic saw the mission of philosophy not only in the search for [[truth]], but in the [[reform]]ation of life and in the [[salvation]] of mankind.  It was permeated with a faith in the metaphysical import of the [[nation]] and convinced that man could fulfill his [[vocation]] only within the communion of [[spirit]]s that was the nation, that nations determined the evolution of mankind, and more particularly that the Polish nation had been assigned the role of [[Messiah]] to the nations.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

These three traits—the founding of a [[metaphysic]] on the concept of the [[soul]] and on the concept of the [[nation]], and the assignment to the latter of [[reform]]ative-[[soteriological]] tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians.  Some, such as [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński|Hoene-Wroński]], saw the Messiah in [[philosophy]] itself; others, such as the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]], saw Him in the [[Polish nation]].  Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, "[[Messianism]]".  It came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term "[[Idealism]]" does to [[Germany|German]] metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the nineteenth century there appeared in Poland a host of metaphysicians unanimous as to these basic precepts, if strikingly at variance as to details.  Their only center was [[Paris]], which hosted [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński]] (1778–1853).  Otherwise they lived in isolation: [[Bronisław Trentowski]] (1808–69) in [[Germany]]; [[Józef Gołuchowski]] (1797–1858) in [[Congress Poland]]; [[August Cieszkowski]] (1814–94) and [[Karol Libelt]] (1807–75) in [[Wielkopolska]] (western Poland); [[Józef Kremer]] (1806–75) in [[Kraków]].  Most of them became active only after the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important role in the Messianist movement was also played by the Polish [[Romantic poet]]s, [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (1798–1855), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] (1809–49) and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]] (1812–59), as well as by religious activists such as [[Andrzej Towiański]] (1799–1878).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/&gt;

Between the [[philosopher]]s and the [[poet]]s, the method of reasoning, and often the results, differed.  The poets desired to create a specifically ''Polish'' philosophy, the philosophers—an absolute ''universal'' philosophy.  The Messianist philosophers knew contemporary European philosophy and drew from it; the poets created more of a home-grown metaphysic.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important difference among the Messianists was that some were [[rationalist]]s, others—[[mysticism|mystics]].  Wroński's philosophy was no less rationalist than [[Hegel]]'s, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/&gt;

The Messianists were not the only Polish philosophers active in the period between the 1830 and 1863 uprisings.  Much more widely known in Poland were [[Catholic]] thinkers such as Father [[Piotr Semenenko]] (1814–86), [[Florian Bochwic]] (1779–1856) and [[Eleonora Ziemięcka]] (1819–69), Poland's first woman philosopher.  The Catholic philosophy of the period was more widespread and fervent than profound or creative.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also active were pure [[Hegelian]]s such as [[Tytus Szczeniowski]] (1808–80) and leftist Hegelians such as [[Edward Dembowski]] (1822–46).&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outstanding representative of the philosophy of Common Sense, [[Michał Wiszniewski]] (1794–1865), had studied at that Enlightenment bastion, [[Krzemieniec]]; in 1820, in [[France]], he had attended the lectures of [[Victor Cousin]]; and in 1821, in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], he had met the head of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] at the time, [[Dugald Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active as well were [[wikt:Precursor|precursors]] of [[Positivism]] such as [[Józef Supiński]] (1804–93) and [[Dominik Szulc]] (1797–1860)—links between the earlier Enlightenment age of the brothers Śniadecki and the coming age of [[Positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Positivism==

[[File:Prus 002.jpg|thumb|right|75px|[[Bolesław Prus]]]]

The [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy that took form in Poland after the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] was hardly identical with the philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]].  It was in fact a return to the line of [[Jan Śniadecki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]]—a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period—now enriched with the ideas of Comte.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it belonged only partly to [[philosophy]].  It combined Comte's ideas with those of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober, [[empirical]] attitude to life.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish Positivism was a reaction against philosophical speculation, but also against [[romanticism]] in poetry and [[idealism]] in politics.  It was less a scholarly movement than [[literature|literary]], [[politics|political]] and [[society|social]].  Few original books were published, but many were translated from the philosophical literature of the West—not Comte himself, but easier writers: [[Hippolyte Taine]], Mill, Spencer, [[Alexander Bain]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the Germans [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Friedrich Albert Lange]], the Danish philosopher [[Höffding]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176"/&gt;

The disastrous outcome of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had produced a distrust of romanticism, an aversion to ideals and illusions, and turned the search for redemption toward sober thought and work directed at realistic goals.  The watchword became "organic work"—a term for the campaign for economic improvement, which was regarded as a prime requisite for progress.  Poles prepared for such work by studying the [[natural sciences]] and [[economics]]:  they absorbed [[Charles Darwin]]'s biological theories, Mill's [[economic]] theories, [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s [[determinism|deterministic]] theory of [[civilization]].  At length they became aware of the connection between their own convictions and aims and the [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]], and borrowed its name and watchwords.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PiotrChmielowski.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Piotr Chmielowski|Chmielowski]]]]
This movement, which had begun still earlier in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], became concentrated with time in the [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Congress Poland]] centered about [[Warsaw]] and is therefore commonly known as the "Warsaw Positivism."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its chief venue was the Warsaw ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (Weekly Review);&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/&gt; [[Warsaw University]] (the "Main School") had been closed by the [[Russia]]ns in 1869.

The pioneers of the Warsaw Positivism were [[natural scientist]]s and [[physician]]s rather than philosophers, and still more so [[journalist]]s and [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]]: [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] (1849–1938), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904), [[Adolf Dygasiński]] (1839–1902),&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolesław Prus]] (1847–1912).  Prus developed an original [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]]-inspired [[ethics|ethical]] system in his book, ''[[s:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Edward Pieścikowski, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt; his 1873 public lecture "[[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]", subsequently printed as a pamphlet, is a remarkably prescient contribution to what would, in the following century, become the field of [[logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|logology ("the science of science")]].
[[File:Adam_Mahrburg_frotispice.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Adam Mahrburg]]]]
The movement's leader was [[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]] (1850–1917), a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]].  In 1872 he wrote:  "We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/&gt;

The Warsaw Positivists—who included faithful [[Catholic]]s such as Father [[Franciszek Krupiński]] (1836–98)—formed a common front against Messianism together with the [[Neo-Kantian]]s.  The Polish [[Kantian]]s were rather loosely associated with Kant and belonged to the Positivist movement.  They included [[Władysław Mieczysław Kozłowski]] (1858–1935), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904) and [[Marian Massonius]] (1862–1945).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant philosophical mind in this period was [[Adam Mahrburg]] (1855–1913).  He was a [[Positivist]] in his understanding of philosophy as a discipline and in his uncompromising ferreting out of speculation, and a [[Kantian]] in his interpretation of mind and in his centering of philosophy upon the [[theory of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kraków]], Father [[Stefan Pawlicki]] (1839–1916), professor of philosophy at the [[University of Kraków]], was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacked talent for writing or teaching.  Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, alien to what was happening in the West and in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Even before Poland regained independence at the end of [[World War I]], her intellectual life continued to develop.  This was the case particularly in [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Warsaw]], where in lieu of underground lectures and secret scholarly organizations a ''[[Wolna Wszechnica Polska]]'' (Free Polish University) was created in 1905 and the tireless [[Władysław Weryho]] (1868–1916) had in 1898 founded Poland's first philosophical journal, ''Przegląd Filozoficzny'' (The Philosophical Review), and in 1904 a Philosophical Society.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 Weryho founded a Psychological Society, and subsequently Psychological and Philosophical Institutes.  About 1910 the small number of professionally trained philosophers increased sharply, as individuals returned who had been inspired by Mahrburg's underground lectures to study philosophy in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Lwów]] and [[Kraków]] or abroad.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356"/&gt;
[[File:Kazimierz Twardowski 1933.jpg|thumb|left|70px|[[Kazimierz Twardowski]]]]

[[Kraków]] as well, especially after 1910, saw a quickening of the philosophical movement, particularly at the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], where at the prompting of [[Władysław Heinrich]] there came into being in 1911 a Committee for the History of Polish Philosophy and there was an immense growth in the number of philosophical papers and publications, no longer only of a [[historical]] character.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Lwów]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) from 1895 stimulated a lively philosophical movement, in 1904 founded the [[Polish Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;"Twardowski, Kazimierz," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1911 began publication of ''[[Ruch Filozoficzny]]'' (The Philosophical Movement).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/&gt;

There was growing interest in western philosophical currents, and much discussion of [[Pragmatism]] and [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Henri Poincaré]]'s [[Conventionalism]], [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the [[Marburg School]], and the [[social science|social-science]] [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]].  At the same time, original ideas developed on Polish soil.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/&gt;

Those who distinguished themselves in Polish philosophy in these pre-[[World War I]] years of the twentieth century, formed two groups.

One group developed apart from [[higher education|institutions of higher learning]] and [[learned societies]], and appealed less to trained philosophers than to broader circles, which it (if but briefly) captured.  It constituted a reaction against the preceding period of [[Positivism]], and included [[Stanisław Brzozowski (writer)|Stanisław Brzozowski]] (1878–1911), [[Wincenty Lutosławski]] (1863–1954) and, to a degree, [[Edward Abramowski]] (1868–1918).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of philosophers who started off Polish philosophy in the twentieth century had an [[academic]] character.  They included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957) in [[Kraków]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) in [[Lwów]], and [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931) abroad—all three, active members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].  Despite the considerable differences among them, they shared some basic features:  all three were [[empiricist]]s concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the restoration of Poland's independence in 1918, the two older universities ([[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], [[Lwów University]]) were joined by four new ones ([[Warsaw University]], [[Poznań University]], [[Wilno University]], [[Lublin University]]).  New philosophical journals appeared; all the university cities formed philosophical associations; conventions of Polish philosophers were held; philosophy became more professional, academic, scholarly.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 363–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan Łukasiewicz.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Jan Łukasiewicz]]]]
A characteristic of the [[interbellum]] was that [[maximalist]], metaphysical currents began to fade away.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant ambition in philosophical theory now was not breadth but [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].  This was a period of [[Academic specialization|specialization]], consistent with the conviction that general philosophy would not yield precise results such as could be obtained in [[logic]], [[psychology]] or the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tadeusz Kotarbiński.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]]]]
[[File:Stanisław Leśniewski.jpg|thumb|right|75px|[[Stanisław Leśniewski]]]]
A few individuals did develop a general philosophical outlook:  notably, [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] (1885–1939), and [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, however, [[Academic specialization|specialization]] was the rule.  The Kraków school, true to tradition, showed an eminently historical character and produced a [[medievalist]] of world renown, Father [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lwów school concentrated on the analysis of [[concept]]s; and in doing so, it considered both their aspects, the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]—hence, the [[psychological]] and the [[logical]].  Twardowski himself continued working at the border of psychology and logic; his pupils, however, generally split in their interests, specializing in either psychology or logic.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366"/&gt;

The [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] program that Twardowski passed on to his pupils, and which they in turn spread throughout Poland, was affined to that of [[Franz Brentano]]'s school (Twardowski's ''[[alma mater]]'') in [[Austria]] and to that of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[analytic philosophy|analytic school]], which likewise had arisen as a reaction against [[Speculative philosophy|speculative]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[alumni]] of the Lwów school entered three distinct fields.  Some devoted themselves to [[psychology]]: [[Stefan Błachowski]] (1889–1962), professor at [[Poznań]], entirely; [[Władysław Witwicki]] (1878–1948), professor at [[Warsaw]], partly.  Others pursued the [[theory of knowledge]]:  they included [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (1890–1963), professor at [[Lwów]], and after [[World War II]] at [[Poznań]], whose views resembled [[Neopositivism]] and who developed an original theory of radical [[Conventionalism]].  The third group worked in [[mathematical logic|mathematical, or symbolic, logic]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt;
[[File:AlfredTarski1968.jpeg|thumb|left|120px|[[Alfred Tarski]]]]
The most important center for mathematical logic was Warsaw.  The Warsaw school of logic was headed by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956) and [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] (1886–1939), professors at [[Warsaw University]].  The first of their pupils to achieve eminence, even before [[World War II]], was [[Alfred Tarski]] (1902–83),&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt; from 1939 in the [[United States]], where he became a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Another pupil of Łukasiewicz, Bolesław Sobociński (28 June 1906 – 31 October 1980), became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]].  The Warsaw logic gained a worldwide importance similar to that of the Kraków [[medievalism]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt;
[[File:Konstanty Michalski.png|thumb|left|100px|[[Konstanty Michalski]]]]
Warsaw was not, however, the sole Polish venue for logic studies.  They were initiated at [[Kraków]] by [[Ivan Śleszyński]] (''aka'' Jan Śleszyński, ''aka'' Ivan Vladislavovich Sleshinsky; 23 July 1854 – 9 March 1931), professor of mathematics and logic.  At Kraków also, and later at [[Lwów]], logic studies were conducted by [[Leon Chwistek]] (1884–1944), a multi-faceted and somewhat eccentric thinker—mathematician, philosopher, [[esthetics|esthetician]], painter—whose name came to be associated popularly with his concept of "plural realities."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Florian Znaniecki.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Florian Znaniecki]]]] 

After [[Leon Petrażycki|Petrażycki]]'s death, the outstanding [[legal]] philosopher was [[Czesław Znamierowski]] (1888–1967), professor of philosophy at Poznań.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 367–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another leading thinker of the period, active on the borderlines of [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]], in both [[Poland]] and the [[United States]], was [[Florian Znaniecki]] (1882–1958).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[interbellum]], the philosopher members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957; Kraków), [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938; Lwów), [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931; Warsaw), and, from the following generation: [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947), [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956), and [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980).  Michalski's historical works revolutionized prevailing views on ''via moderna'' in late [[medieval philosophy]].  Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and is known for his "[[Polish notation]]."  Tatarkiewicz was the first to prepare in [[Polish language|Polish]] a large-scale comprehensive history of [[western philosophy]] and a ''History of Aesthetics'' and worked at systematizing the [[concept]]s of [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970), [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), and [[Alfred Tarski]] became members of the Academy.&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 32"/&gt;
[[File:Leszek Kolakowski 1971.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Leszek Kołakowski]]]]
For some four decades following World War II, in Poland, a disproportionately prominent official role was given to [[Marxist philosophy]].  This, and contemporaneous sociopolitical currents, stimulated [[Leszek Kołakowski]] (1927–2009), writing in [[exile]], to publish influential critiques of [[Marxist]] theory and [[communist]] practice.  Kołakowski also wrote a remarkable history of ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle'', Penguin Books, 1972, ASIN B000OIXO7E.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan-wolenski-2009.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|170px|[[Jan Woleński]]]]
Similarly notable for his critiques of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism]] was [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] (1902–95), [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]], a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] philosopher of the [[Dominican Order]] who lectured in [[Rome]] at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (the ''Angelicum'') and at the [[University of Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]]. Bocheński also gained renown for his work in [[logic]] and [[ethics]].

Other Polish philosophers of the postwar period included [[:pl:Andrzej Zabłudowski|Andrzej Zabłudowski]] (1938–2008), a logician and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] of world influence, especially in the theory of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], working at Warsaw University except for a three-decade hiatus beginning in 1968; [[Marek Siemek]] (1942–2011), a historian of [[Germany|German]] [[Transcendental Philosophy|transcendental philosophy]] and recipient of an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Bonn University]]; and [[Jan Woleński]] (born 1940), a broadly erudite thinker at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], specializing in the history of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lwów-Warsaw school]] and in [[analytic philosophy]] and widely recognized in Poland as an [[atheism|atheist]] and exponent of replacing religion classes in Polish schools with philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDgWy_9GqwU|title=Laureat Nagrody FNP w obszarze nauk humanistycznych i społecznych, prof.

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a Canadian [[Academic tenure|untenured]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Rogers]] (18 May 2017). [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html "The Uproar Over 'Transracialism'"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared aspects of the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017&gt;Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"], ''New York'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within [[feminism]] and academic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2017|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/pdf|title=In Defense of Transracialism|work=Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=(263–278), 264|doi-access=free|doi=10.1111/hypa.12327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full|archive-date=10 May 2017|dead-url=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]  began criticizing the article and attacking Tuvel. From 29 April an open letter, naming a member of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

On 1 May a post appeared on the journal's Facebook page apologizing for the article's publication, on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]].

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the article after noticing the contrast, in 2015, between the reception given to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===

Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]. Assuming there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel then argues for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&amp;nbsp;... self-identification".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} She maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Tuvel suggests that Dolezal's exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], self-identification as black, and living as someone society had accepted as black, would be enough to deem her black. From a genetic standpoint, there is no matter of fact, no "real race", Tuvel writes.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Four objections to [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] are addressed and rejected. The first is that a claim to be black cannot be accepted without the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; Tuvel quotes the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]], who called this the "one thing that binds black people"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"], ''RealClear Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Following this argument, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}

The second objection holds that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed on ancestry (in America, at least). No matter the genetic facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters; it is crucial because it is regarded as crucial. Tuvel argues that this position—espoused by [[Cressida Heyes]], the associate editor who posted the apology—holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo". How racial categorization does operate is not necessarily how it should operate.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the harmful practice of [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between what she calls problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification is not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; her change does not appear to be temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}}

A fourth objection holds that Dolezal is engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege". This argument holds that a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it; a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel quotes the writer Tamara Winfrey Harris: "I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}}; Harris, Tamara Winfrey (16 June 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/rachel-dolezals-harmful-masquerade.html "Black Like Who? Rachel Dolezal’s Harmful Masquerade"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition. She argues further than the exercise of privilege is a separate issue. That more men than women get jobs as philosophy professors does not mean we should get rid of philosophy professors; instead, we should address the inequality. Similarly, if society comes to accept transracialism, it could be made easier for all races to transition. Tuvel adds that it is hard to see how Dolezal could be accused of exercising white privilege by choosing to give it up.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

Finally, Tuvel asks whether, if we accept her position, we are obliged to accept any and all self-identification, such as individuals who [[Otherkin|identify as nonhuman]]. She repeats that two components are necessary for a successful change: self-identification and social acceptance of the new identity. It is reasonable to ask that social acceptance depend on it being possible for individuals to imagine what it is like to exist and be treated as a member of the category they seek to join. Without that, there is "too little commonality to make the group designation meaningful".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=272}}

Botts was unable to attend, but she submitted a couple of paragraphs in reply to Tuvel and the panel members, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the United States in the 21st century is that it is an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".

Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University, who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt; made an effort on Facebook to defend Tuvel by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable", and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up. Several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article.  A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt; Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;

The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of “transracialism”. We endorse Hypatia's stated commitment to "actively reflect and engage the diversity within feminism, the diverse experiences and situations of women, and the diverse forms that gender takes around the globe," and we find that this submission was published without being held to that commitment.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;"Open letter to Hypatia", Google Docs.

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to Justin Weinberg, [[associate professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of South Carolina]], and Jesse Singal of ''New York'' magazine, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Regarding the term ''transgenderism'', [[GLAAD]] does caution against its use. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name that Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable; it consisted of a paragraph explaining that, barring (for example) objections from the rabbi that the prospective convert is not committed to Judaism, those who wish to become Jews can do so.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Weinberg also argued that Tuvel had not identified Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; he wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including 'self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification' (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}}

The criticism that Tuvel had not cited enough women of color may be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Weinberg argued that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out a particular work that was both directly relevant and that had been omitted.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017&gt;Justin Weinberg (1 May 2017).

===Associate editors' apology===
On 30 April 2017—two days before the open letter was delivered to ''Hypatia''—[[Cressida Heyes]], then one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s 10 associate editors,&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors". The post was later removed or made private. On 1 May it was reposted to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page, this time ending with "Sincerely, A Majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors".&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heyes |first1=Cressida |author-link=Cressida Heyes|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |publisher=Personal Facebook page|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qKlW3Fnc |archivedate=9 May 2017 |date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}{{pb}}
{{cite web |last1= |first1=|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/hypatia.editorialoffice/posts/1852550825032876 |publisher=Hypatia Facebook page|archiveurl=https://archive.is/TbVNM |archivedate=13 May 2017 |date=1 May 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; The apology stated: "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors, extend our profound apology to our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy, especially transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color, for the harms that the publication of the article on transracialism has caused":

&lt;blockquote&gt;To compare ethically the lived experience of trans people (from a distinctly external perspective) primarily to a single example of a white person claiming to have adopted a black identity creates an equivalency that fails to recognize the history of racial appropriation, while also associating trans people with racial appropriation. We recognize and mourn that these harms will disproportionately fall upon those members of our community who continue to experience marginalization and discrimination due to racism and cisnormativity.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published", and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined to name the anonymous reviewers.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement, on 1 May 2017, in response to the associate editors' apology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this piece from a place of support for those with non-normative identities, and frustration about the ways individuals who inhabit them are so often excoriated, body-shamed, and silenced. When the case of Rachel Dolezal surfaced, I perceived a transphobic logic that lay at the heart of the constant attacks against her. My article is an effort to extend our thinking alongside transgender theories to other non-normative possibilities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the parenthetical reference to Jenner's previous name,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; which was removed from the article at her request on 4&amp;nbsp;May.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017}} She also acknowledged that "[a] valid reproach is that my article discusses the lives of vulnerable people without sufficiently citing their own first-person experiences and views." Expressing concern about the personal attacks and hate mail she had received, including from commentators who had not read the article, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&amp;nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger", and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===Early response from ''Hypatia''===
[[Sally Scholz]], the journal's editor-in-chief, offered her support to Tuvel on 6 May, writing that "it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data)." The board of associate editors was a policy board with no role in the journal's management, she wrote, and it had acted independently in drafting and posting the letter.{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating—students and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Scholz's position was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. Scholz, the board and the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/finally-a-meek-and-halfhearted-defense-of-rebecca-tuvel-from-hypatia/article/2008107 "Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia"], ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], [[Leslie Francis]] (treasurer), Heidi Grasswick (secretary), Solomon (president), and [[Lisa Tessman]] (chair), it acknowledged the "intensity of experience and convictions around matters of intersectionality", and the "egregious history of treatment of women of color feminists and feminists from other marginalized social positions" within academic philosophy. Dismissing the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a strong response, the board wrote that such a view from "outsiders" reflects "ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization, disrespect, and misrepresentation of oppressed groups".&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Journal-s-Board-Disavows/240116 "Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement continued that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation with the editor-in-chief and on their own behalf only. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief and that the article would not be retracted "barring discovery of misconduct or plagiarism". The associate editors' apology remained on ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page; on 25 May 2017 it was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors.&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt;

===Early academic reaction===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archivedate=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of harm had been "twisted beyond all recognition" by the associate editors' letter, according to José Luis Bermúdez, professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Bermúdez, José Luis (5 May 2017). [https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/05/05/real-damage-done-flare-over-philosophers-journal-article-essay "Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair"], ''Inside Higher Ed''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Several commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; Dan Kaufman, professor of philosophy at [[Missouri State University]], blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".&lt;ref&gt;Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). [http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/dan-kaufman/ "Interview with Dan Kaufman"], ''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that certain issues can be covered only by particular categories of scholar, and that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. For Brubaker, acknowledging himself as a white cisgender man, this position means not only that certain topics are too easily closed off to particular scholars, but that scholars with [[lived experience]] are expected to focus on those topics.&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
Systemic [[sexism]] within the discipline was cited. There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process that had allowed the paper to be published. "What you do when someone submits the paper is you find people who are experts in that area to review it," she told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', "to make sure that it is situated within contemporary scholarly discussions. Obviously they didn’t do that."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], later appointed co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Tuvel-s-Article-So/240029 "Why Tuvel’s Article So Troubled Its Critics"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Traldi argued in ''[[Quillette]]'' that the dispute was partly attributable to the influence of [[Continental philosophy|continental]] as opposed to [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophy, and the idea that philosophy should be a vehicle for social change, rather than an impartial search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Traldi, Oliver (9 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' resignations and task force===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/&gt; On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Weinberg21July2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia’s Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archivedate=26 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archivedate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interim&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archivedate=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 symposium, Mellon Foundation grant===
[[Peg Birmingham]], editor of ''[[Philosophy Today]]'', published a symposium on Tuvel's article in the journal's Winter 2018 edition, with contributions from Chloë Taylor (Alberta), [[Lewis Gordon]] ([[University of Connecticut|UConn]]), Kris Sealey ([[Fairfield University|Fairfield]]), Sabrina Hom ([[Georgia College &amp; State University|GCSU]]), Tina Fernandes Botts and Rebecca Tuvel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pdcnet.org/collection-anonymous/browse?fp=philtoday&amp;fq=philtoday%2fVolume%2f8938%7c62%2f8999%7cIssue%3a+1%2f "Special symposium: Rebecca Tuvel and her interlocutors"], ''Philosophy Today''. 62(1), Winter 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 the [[Andrew W.

'''Idealistic pluralism''' is a philosophical position that suggests while an individual's understanding of the world might be limited to only the ideas within his or her mind, it can be known in this way by more than one mind.

Idealistic pluralism rejects the idea of [[solipsism]], which would be an [[idealistic monism]].  In the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], an idealistic pluralism is found in his assertion that many minds (each knowing the world though their own representations) exist, separate from each other, and from God.

[[Image:Fallen tree2.jpg|right|thumb|A fallen tree in a forest]]

"'''If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?'''" is a philosophical [[thought experiment]] that raises questions regarding [[observation]] and [[perception]].

==History==
Philosopher [[George Berkeley]], in his work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), proposes, "But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', 1734. section 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden [...] no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', 1734. section 45.&lt;/ref&gt; (It is worth noting that the quote from section 45 is arguably a statement of an ''objection'' to Berkeley's view, and not a proclamation of it.) Nevertheless, Berkeley never actually wrote about the question.&lt;ref&gt;Whether Berkeley thought objects continued to exist when unperceived by finite minds, and if so, in what manner, is the subject of serious debate among Berkeley scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine ''The Chautauquan'', the question was put, "If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?" They then went on to answer the query with, "No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion."&lt;ref&gt;''The Chautauquan'', June 1883, Volume 3, Issue 9, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one. The magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'' corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, "If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?" And gave a more technical answer, "Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound."&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', April 5, 1884, pg 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] is reported to have asked his fellow physicist and friend [[Niels Bohr]], one of the founding fathers of [[quantum mechanics]], whether he realistically believed that 'the moon does not exist if nobody is looking at it.' To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of an infallible [[conjecture]]—one that cannot be either proved or disproved.

The current phrasing appears to have originated in the 1910 book ''Physics'' by [[Charles Riborg Mann]] and [[George Ransom Twiss]]. The question "When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound? Why?" is posed along with many other questions to quiz readers on the contents of the chapter, and as such, is posed from a purely physical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles Riborg and George Ransom Twiss. ''Physics''. Scott, Foresman and Co., 1910, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==

===The possibility of unperceived existence ===
{{Main|George Berkeley}}
'''Can something exist without being perceived?''' – e.g. "''is sound only sound if a person hears it?''" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.&lt;ref name=plymouth&gt;[http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/philosophy/what-is/ "What is Philosophy? – Analysis", Plymouth State University, Philosophy Department]&lt;/ref&gt; It is human beings that are able to perceive it.&lt;ref name=plymouth/&gt; George Berkeley in the 18th century developed [[subjective idealism]], a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory to respond to these questions, coined famously as "to be is to be perceived". Today meta-physicists are split. According to [[substance theory]], a substance is distinct from its properties, while according to [[bundle theory]], an object is merely its [[sense data]]. The definition of sound, simplified, is a hearable noise. The tree will make a sound, even if nobody heard it, because it could have been heard. 

The answer to this question depends on the definition of sound. Since sound does not exist without our hearing of it, sound does not exist if we do not hear it. However, when a tree falls, the motion disturbs the air and sends off air waves. This physical phenomena which can be measured by instruments other than our ears exists regardless of human perception (seeing or hearing ) of it. Putting together, although the tree falling on the island sends off air waves, it does not produce sound if no human is within the distance where the air waves are strong enough for a human to perceive them.

===Knowledge of the unobserved world===
{{Main|Observer-expectancy effect}}
'''Can we assume the unobserved world functions the same as the observed world?''' – e.g., "''does observation affect outcome?''"&lt;br&gt;
A similar question does not involve whether or not an unobserved event occurs ''predictably'', like it occurs when it is observed. The [[anthropic principle]] suggests that the observer, just in its existence, may impose on the reality observed.
However, most people, as well as scientists, assume that the observer doesn't change whether the tree-fall causes a sound or not, but this is an impossible claim to prove. However, many scientists would argue that a truly unobserved event is one which realises no effect (imparts no information) on any other (where 'other' might be e.g., human, sound-recorder or rock), it therefore can have no legacy in the present (or ongoing) wider physical universe.  It may then be recognized that the unobserved event was absolutely identical to an event which did not occur at all. Of course, the fact that the tree is known to have changed state from 'upright' to 'fallen' implies that the event must be observed to ask the question at all – even if only by the supposed deaf onlooker.
The British philosopher of science [[Roy Bhaskar]], credited with developing [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] has argued, in apparent reference to this riddle, that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If men ceased to exist sound would continue to travel and heavy bodies to fall to the earth in exactly the same way, though ex hypothesi there would be no-one to know it&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008 [1975]), ''A Realist Theory of Science'', London: Verso, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This existence of an unobserved real is integral to Bhaskar's ontology, which contends (in opposition to the various strains of positivism which have dominated both natural and social science in the twentieth century) that 'real structures exist independently of and are often out of phase with the actual patterns of events'.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008[1975]), ''A Realist Theory of Science'', London: Verso, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In social science, this has made his approach popular amongst contemporary Marxists — notably [[Alex Callinicos]] – who postulate the existence of real social forces and structures which might not always be observable.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D. (2002), "Marxism", in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D, &amp; Furlong, P. (2002), “Ontology and Epistemology in Political Science”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callinicos, A. (2006), The Resources of Critique, Cambridge: Polity, pp. 155–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dissimilarity between sensation and reality===
{{Main|Qualia}}
'''What is the difference between what something is, and how it ''appears''?''' – e.g., ''"sound is the variation of [[pressure]] that propagates through matter as a wave''"&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps the most important topic the riddle offers is the division between perception of an object and how an object really is. If a tree exists outside of perception then there is no way for us to know that the tree exists. So then, what do we mean by 'existence', what is the difference between perception and reality? Also, people may also say, if the tree exists outside of perception (as [[common sense]] would dictate), then it will produce [[sound wave]]s. However, these sound waves will not actually ''sound'' like anything. Sound as it is mechanically understood will occur, but sound as it is understood by sensation will not occur. So then, how is it known that 'sound as it is mechanically understood' will occur if that sound is not perceived?

==In popular culture==

Canadian songwriter, [[social activist]] and [[environmentalist]] [[Bruce Cockburn]] poses the question in the chorus of his 1989 song "If a Tree Falls" and frames it with his lyrics as a pressing question regarding the cause and effect of [[deforestation]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Washington-state-based wilderness conservatory [[Northwest Trek]] used a shortened form of the quote in its mid-1970s television advertisement, as such: "There is no sound unless someone is there to see it or hear it. Experience it at Northwest Trek."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The quote also forms the bridge of the protagonist's solo number "Waving Through A Window" in the musical ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]'', in line with the tree motif essential to the plot. The song itself discusses a feeling of isolation through fear of failing in social interactions, as a part of the main character's [[social anxiety disorder]].{{huh|date=July 2018}}{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Incarnational humanism''' is a brand of [[humanism]] which affirms the value and essential goodness of human reason and [[human culture|culture]]. Developed in a [[Christian]] framework, incarnational humanism asserts a unification of the [[secular]] and the [[sacred]] with the goal of a common humanity. This unification is fully realized in the participatory nature of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]]s, particularly the [[Eucharist]]. The recognition of this goal requires a necessary difference between the [[church (Christian)|church]] and the world, where both "spheres are unified in their service of humanity."

The '''Modern Greek Enlightenment''' ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}, ''Diafotismos'', "enlightenment," "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Origins==
{{further information|Ottoman Greece}}
The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Greek [[merchant]]s financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Intellectual Revival'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to 1821.  It was not by chance that on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] the most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Ioannina]], [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] (Izmir) and [[Ayvalik]], all major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritannicaB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Phanariotes===
The [[Phanariotes]] were a small caste of Greek families who took their collective name from the [[Phanar]] quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is still housed. They held various administrative posts within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the most important of which were those of [[hospodar]], or prince, of the [[Danubian principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Most hospodars acted as patrons of Greek culture, education, and printing. These academies attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was some contact with intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] central Europe. For the most part they supported the Ottoman system of government, too much to play a significant part in the emergence of the Greek national movement; however, their support of learning produced many highly educated Greek scholars who benefited from the cosmopolitan environment the Phanariotes cultivated in their principalities.&lt;ref name=BritannicaC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Transformation toward emancipation, The Phanariotes'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

This environment was in general a special attraction for young, ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to their national enlightenment. The Princely Academies of [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Bucharest]] and [[Princely Academy of Iaşi|Iasi]] also played a crucial role in this movement. Characteristically the authors of the ''[[Geographia Neoteriki]]'', one of the most remarkable works of that era, [[Daniel Philippidis]] and [[Grigorios Konstantas]], were both educated in this environment.&lt;ref name=Kopecek&gt;{{cite book |first=Michal |last=Kopeček |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |language=|year=2006|pages= 73–79|ref= |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA74 |publisher=Central European University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last=Sussex |first2= Eade|last2= John Christopher|title=Culture and nationalism in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe |language=|year=1985|page= 8|ref= |isbn=978-0-89357-146-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oMYPTZOCG8eAswbmse30DA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eQZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography%22&amp;q=%22Daniil+Philippidis+and+Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography+of+1791%2C+one+of+the+most+remarkable+works+of+the+%27Neo-Hellenic+Enlightenment%27%2C+%22#search_anchor |publisher=Slavica Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One effect was the creation of an [[Attic Greek|atticized]] form of Greek by linguistic purists, which was adopted as the official [[state language|language of the state]] and came to be known as ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified). This created [[diglossia]] in the Greek linguistic sphere, in which ''Katharevousa'' and the vernacular idiom known as [[Demotic Greek|''Dimotiki'']] were in conflict until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BritannicaA/&gt;

The transmission of Enlightenment ideas into Greek thought also influenced the development of a national consciousness. The publication of the journal [[Hermes o Logios]] encouraged the ideas of the Enlightenment. The journal's objective was to advance Greek science, philosophy and culture.  Two of the main figures of the Greek Enlightenment, [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]], encouraged Greek nationalists to pursue contemporary political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= M.

Greek Enlightenment concerned not only language and the [[humanities]] but also the [[sciences]]. Some scholars such as [[Methodios Anthrakites]], [[Evgenios Voulgaris]], [[Athanasios Psalidas]], [[Balanos Vasilopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Darbaris]] had a background in [[Mathematics]] and the [[Physical Sciences]] and published scientific books into Greek for use in Greek schools. [[Rigas Feraios]] also published an Anthology of Physics.

'''Neo-scholasticism''' (also known as '''neo-scholastic [[Thomism]]'''&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |author=[[Edward Feser]] |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part I (archived copy) |accessdate=2011-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129133527/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or '''neo-Thomism'''&lt;!--'Neo-Thomism' and 'Neo-Thomist' redirect here--&gt; because of the great influence of the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] on the movement), is a revival and development of medieval [[scholasticism]] in [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology]] and [[scholastic philosophy|philosophy]] which began in the second half of the 19th century.

==Origins==
During the medieval period, [[scholasticism]] became the standard accepted method of philosophy and theology. The Scholastic method declined with the advent of [[humanism]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, after which time it came to be viewed by some as rigid and formalistic. "Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear.  An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during the 16th century and enriched Scholastic literature with many eminent contributions. [[Thomas Cajetan|Thomas de Vio Cajetan]] (1469–1534), [[Gabriel Vásquez]] (1551–1604), [[Francisco de Toledo (Jesuit)|Toletus]] (1532–1596), [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Fonseca]] (1528–1599), and especially [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617) were profound thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles they had adopted."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter VIII: "Chapter VIII: Forerunners of the Neo-Scholastic Revival," Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as J. A. Weisheipl [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] emphasizes, within the [[Dominican Order]] Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: "Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}  “The Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, ” James Weisheipl, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican scholasticism and neo-scholasticism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].

In the mid–19th century, interest in Roman Catholic circles in scholastic methodology and thought began once again to flourish, in large part in reaction against the "[[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]]" inspired by thinkers such as [[Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Hegel]], the use of which was perceived as inimical to Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ''Twentieth-century Catholic theologians'', (Blackwell, 2007), p1.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and core beliefs of theological Modernism were never tightly defined; in large part, Modernism simply represented that which was attacked by Rome in 1907 as ‘the sum of all heresies’. Moreover, given that Modernism remained the perceived enemy of neo-Scholasticism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were certainly changes over the decades in what was attacked. Certainly, however, common threads of thought can be detected.  These include (1) the belief that revelation continued up to and including the present day and, therefore, did not stop with the death of the last apostle; (2) the belief that dogmas were not immutable and that ecclesial dogmatic formulas could change both in interpretation and in content; (3) the use of the historical-critical method in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;See Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many thinkers, the dangers of Modernism could only be overcome by a complete return to scholastic theology. In particular, Catholic interest came to focus on the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose writings were increasingly viewed as the ultimate expression of philosophy and theology, to which all Catholic thought must remain faithful.&lt;ref&gt;This way of approaching Thomas was itself scholastic in inspiration. The scholastics used a book by a renowned scholar, called [[auctor]], as basic course literature. By reading this book thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the theories of the auctor and, thus, of the problems studied in the whole discipline, in a critical and self-confident way. Scholastic works therefore have a tendency to take the form of a long list of "footnotes" to the works studied, not being able to take a stand as theories on their own.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was particularly vigorous at first in Italy. "The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was [[Gaetano Sanseverino]], (1811–1865), a canon at Naples."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, ''The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter IX: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Italy", {{cite web |url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009074833/http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }} Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Jesuit J [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83), who taught at Rome, was a particularly influential figure in his defences of pre-modern theology and philosophy, his argument that a theology based upon a post-Cartesian philosophy undermined Catholic doctrine, and his recommendation that the Aristotelian scientific method of Aquinas was the theology the Church now needed.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ‘Thomism’, in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology'', (Cambridge, 2011), p507.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published until 1891 a review entitled ''La Scienza Italiana''. Numerous works were produced by [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]] (1822–92), [[Giuseppe Pecci]], [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]] (1833–93), Satolli (1839–1909), Liberatore (1810–92), Barberis (1847–96), Schiffini (1841–1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of Scholasticism, and less to the empirical sciences or to the history of philosophy.

Papal support for such trends had begun under Pope [[Pius IX]], who had recognized the importance of the movement in various letters. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the [[syllabus of errors|''Syllabus errorum'']] (1864) and the proclamation of papal infallibility (1870) all heralded a move away from Modernist forms of theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important moment for the spread of the movement occurred with Pope [[Leo XIII]]’s [[encyclical]] "[[Aeterni Patris]]", issued on 4 August 1879. ''Aeterni Patris'' set out what would come to be seen as the principles of neo-scholasticism, and provided the stimulus for the donation of increased support to neo-scholastic thought. It called for ‘Christian philosophy to be restored according to the spirit of St Thomas’.

==Key principles==
Neo-scholasticism sought to restore the fundamental doctrines embodied in the scholasticism of the 13th century. The essential conceptions may be summarized as follows:

1. [[God]], [[Actus purus|pure actuality]] and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: He alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His infinite knowledge includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible.

2. As to our knowledge of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the [[oak]]-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added—size, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the Aristotelean solution of the [[problem of universals]]. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of Scholasticism than a theory of [[evolution]] which would regard even the essences of things as products of change.

But this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of [[Entelechy|act]] and potency. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of matter and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of matter and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with existence. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the universe converge towards an end which is known to God; finality involves optimism.

3.  Man, a compound of body (matter) and of [[soul]] (form), puts forth activities of a higher order—knowledge and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. this oak; through his intellect he knows the abstract and universal (the oak). All our intellectual activity rests on sensory function; but through the active intellect (intellectus agens) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the intellectual possibility. Hence the characteristic of the idea, its non-materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and [[immortality]] of the soul. Here, too, is the foundation of logic and of the theory of knowledge, the justification of our judgments and [[syllogism]]s.

Upon knowledge follows the appetitive process, sensory or intellectual according to the sort of knowledge. The [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''appetitus intellectualis'') in certain conditions [[Free will|is free]], and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally obliged, though not compelled, to attain it.

Natural happiness would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess God in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our supernatural happiness will consist in the direct intuition of God, the beatific vision. Here philosophy ends and theology begins.

==Late-19th-century spread==
In the period from the publication of [[Aeterni Patris]] in 1879 until the 1920s, neo-scholasticism gradually established itself as exclusive and all-pervading.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1879, Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]], and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called "Leonine Edition", of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Previous critical editions of Thomas’s work had been published before, at Parma in 1852-73, and in Paris in 1871-80, but the Leonine edition, produced under the guidance of [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor of theology at the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), superseded both of these.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Leo XIII increased Thomist studies in his support for the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), by founding its Faculty of [[Philosophy]] in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

Accordingly, the thought of Thomas Aquinas came to be assessed positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems of thought. In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen in contrast to the thought of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (itself seen as representative of ‘modern’ thought).&lt;ref&gt;For example, Boutroux thought that Aristotle's system might well serve as an offset to [[Kantism]] and evolution. ''Aristote, Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie'', (Paris, 1901, 202). Moreover, [[Paulsen]], ‘Kant der Philosoph des Protestantismus’, ''Kantstudien'', (1899) and [[Eucken]], ''Thomas von Aquino u. Kant, Ein Kampf zweier Welten'', loc. cit., 1901 declared neo-Thomism the rival of Kantism, and the conflict between them the "clash of two worlds". [[Adolf Harnack]], ''Lehrbuch d. Dogmengesch'', III, 3rd. ed., 327, [[Seeberg]], ''Realencyklopädie f. Prot. Theol. '' 5. v. "Scholastik" and others argued against underrating the value of scholastic doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ‘modern’ forms of thought, including [[Ontologism]], [[Tradition]]alism, the [[Dualistic_cosmology#In_Christianity|dualism]]{{dn|date=March 2018}} of [[Anton Günther]], and the thought of [[Descartes]], were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.

The movement also spread into other countries. It found supporters in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83) and [[Stöckl]] (1823–95), and the authors of the "Philosophia Lacensis" published at Maria Laach by the Jesuits (Pesch, Hontheim, Cathrein), Gutberlet, Commer, Willmann, Kaufmann, Glossner, Grabmann and Schneid.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Gonzalez (1831–92), Orti y Lara, Urráburu, and Gómez Izquierdo&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de Groot&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de San (1832–1904), Dupont and Lepidi&lt;/ref&gt; England,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Maher, John Rickaby, [[Joseph Rickaby]], Boedder (Stonyhurst Series)&lt;/ref&gt;  Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Mandonnet]] at Freiburg.&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Farges, Dormet de Vorges (1910), Vallet, Gardair, Fonsegrive and Piat&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;Kiss and Pécsi.&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Coppens, Poland, Brother Chrysostom, and the professors at the Catholic University (Shanahan, Turner, and Pace).&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;[[Julio Meinvielle]] and [[Nimio de Anquín]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Santroul&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, a particularly important moment was the establishment by Leo XIII at [[Leuven|Louvain]] (then still a francophone university) in 1891 of the "Institut de philosophie" for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute was placed in charge of Mgr (later Cardinal) [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier|Mercier]] whose "Cours de philosophie" was translated into many major European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; It was endorsed by four [[Catholic Congress]]es: Paris (1891); Brussels (1895); Freiburg (1897); Munich (1900).

==Early-20th-century development==
In the early 20th century, neo-Thomism became official Catholic doctrine, and became increasingly defined in opposition to Modernism. In July 1907, Pope [[Pius X]] issued the decree ''Lamentabili sane exitu'', which condemned 65 Modernist propositions. Two months later, he issued the encyclical ''Pascendi Dominici Gregis'', in which he unequivocally condemned the agnosticism, immanentism, and relativism of Modernism as the 'synthesis of all heresies'.&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"&gt;[[Hans Boersma]], ''Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery'', (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p18.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Modernist oath of 1910 was very important; this remained in force until 1966. .&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"/&gt; In 1914, Pope [[Pius X]] acted against Modernism by ordering, though the Sacred Congregation of Studies, the publication of a list of 24 philosophical propositions, propositions summarising the central tenets of neo-scholasticism to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of philosophy, which was intended to promote a purer form of Thomism; in 1916, these 24 propositions were confirmed as normative. In 1917, the Church’s new Code of Canon Law (''Codex Iuris Canonici'') insisted that the doctrine, methods, and principles of Thomas should be used in teaching philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomist thought therefore became reflected in the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before [[Vatican II]].

==Variation within the tradition&lt;!--'Strict observance Thomism' redirects here--&gt;==
While writers such as [[Edouard Hugon]], [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], and [[Henri Grenier]] were maintaining the tradition of the manuals this did not mean that there was no variation or disagreement among thinkers about how best to formulate Thomism, especially in response to contemporary trends. Variation within the tradition of neo-scholastic Thomism is represented by [[Martin Grabmann]] (1875–1949), Amato Masnovo (1880–1955), Francesco Olgiati (1886–1962), and [[Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges]] (1863–1948).&lt;ref&gt;Battista Mondin's Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Jacques Maritain]], and [[Joseph Maréchal]] investigated alternative interpretations of Aquinas from the 1920s until the 1950s.  Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers.

The growth in historical investigation into Thomas’s thought led some to believe that neo-Thomism did not always reflect the thought of Thomas Aquinas himself. This historically oriented theology was particularly carried out by writers such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], and [[Henri de Lubac]].  At [[Vatican II]], traditional neo-Thomist thought was opposed by such exponents of the ''[[nouvelle théologie]]''.

Many Thomists however continue in the neo-scholastic tradition.  Some relatively recent proponents are treated in Battista Mondin's ''Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti'' (2002), which treats Carlo Giacon (1900–1984), Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990), [[Cornelio Fabro]] (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Accessed 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomas Tyn]] (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925–2012), Leo Elders (1926–), and Enrico Berti (1935–), among others.  Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called "'''strict observance Thomism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

Also [[Edward Feser]] in discussing anglophone authors has indicated that proponents of the more traditional Thomist perspective such as [[Ralph McInerny]] foster the possibility of a contemporary revival of neo-scholastic Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2008/11/neo-scholastic-revival.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Feser could be included along with these thinkers and other such as [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] as engaging in a contemporary polemic in defense of the traditional system of Thomistic metaphysics in response to modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thomistic tradition (Part 1)|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html|author=Feser, Edward|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Franciscan school''' was the name given to a group of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers that, in the context of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], gave special contribution to the development of [[science]] and [[scientific method]]ology during the [[High Middle Ages]]. This group includes such names as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]] as well as [[Thomas of York (Franciscan)|Thomas of York]], [[John Peckham]], and [[Richard of Middleton]].

[[Robert Grosseteste]], was the founder of the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Franciscan]] school. He was the first scholastic philosophers to fully understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual path of [[scientific reasoning]]. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again: from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation in order to verify the principles. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to [[Padua]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] in the 17th century.

Under the tuition of Grosseteste and inspired by the writings of [[Arab]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] who had preserved and built upon [[Aristotle]]'s portrait of [[Induction (philosophy)|induction]], Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''observation'', ''hypothesis'', ''experimentation'', and the need for independent ''verification''. He recorded the manner in which he conducted his experiments in precise detail so that others could reproduce and independently test his results — a cornerstone of the [[scientific method]], and a continuation of the work of researchers like [[Al Battani|Albatenius]].

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P. F. Collier &amp; Son Corporation |pages= 126-128 |format= PDF |access-date= 20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture.

'''Philosophy of Eating''' is a concept of food production and nutritional philosophy that matches the source and result of health together.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital [[micronutrients]] generally lost in most food processing.

Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where [[advertising]] along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present.  The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements.

==History==
As a book [[The Philosophy of Eating]] by author [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] in the late 1860s,.&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Bellows (1868) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_Eating_1868.html?id=7Td5xyWSFb4C originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton] 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the middle to late 1860's era.  So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher.

More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in [[raw foodism]] for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including [[vegan|vegan food preparation]] and offshoots related. The [[micronutrients]] [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s aid digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a variety of shared characteristics of the origins of food spelled out in the 1860s book started to mainstream more so as a backlash to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html |title="How to Eat in Seven Words", an article at Dr. Andrew Weil |author=Brad Lemley|publisher=drweil.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the sourcing to consumption in thought as well a contexts for acceptability.

Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by [[George Davey]] who published a 2013 book called ''Break the Trance''.  [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]]
.&lt;ref&gt;George Davey (2013) [http://lccn.loc.gov/2013938024 The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing]  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic.

==Experiences==

Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood.

Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Carrien and Tamra (2006) [http://foodthatnourishes.blogspot.com/2006/10/philosophy-of-eating.html 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution]  2006&lt;/ref&gt; blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach.

Though cited in [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]], health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake.

==Contrast==

Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

Particularly, the scientific basis is now better understood and psychological remediation or behavior patterns are more amenable to that of a reader in modern times contrasted with processed food celebration by.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Kim (2013) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=processed-food-a-two-million-year-history 'Processed Food: A 2-Million-Year History', It is the dark force, we're told, behind the obesity epidemic, the death of the family farm and Tang...]  2013&lt;/ref&gt; The continued strength of industrialized food troubles some people though.

The '''[[philosophy]] of [[healthcare]]''' is the study of the [[ethics]], processes, and people which constitute the maintenance of health for human beings. (Although [[veterinary]] concerns are worthy to note, the body of thought regarding their methodologies and practices is not addressed in this article.) For the most part, however, the philosophy of healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare can be seen as a necessary [[phenomenon]] of human [[civilization]] whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/putting-health-in-perspective Yuval Levin, "Putting Health in Perspective," ''The New Atlantis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of healthcare is primarily concerned with the following elemental questions:

*Who requires and/or deserves healthcare? Is healthcare a fundamental right of all people?
*What should be the basis for calculating the cost of treatments, hospital stays, drugs, etc.?
*How can healthcare best be administered to the greatest number of people?
*What are the necessary parameters for [[clinical trials]] and [[quality assurance]]?
*Who, if anybody, can decide when a patient is in need of "comfort measures" (allowing a natural death by providing medications to treat symptoms related to the patient's illness)?

However, the most important question of all is 'what is health?'. Unless this question is addressed any debate about healthcare will be vague and unbounded. For example, what exactly is a health care intervention? What differentiates healthcare from engineering or teaching, for example? Is health care about 'creating autonomy' or acting in people's best interests? Or is it always both? A 'philosophy' of anything requires baseline philosophical questions, as asked, for example, by philosopher [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvGXLF3uxd0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+seedhouse+health+the+foundations+for+achievement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2lwAOsSnz&amp;sig=m1x991yrTldDBtju1BzbZIKTQUU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3y-mTMycK5TEsAPHsMT-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false David Seedhouse].

Ultimately, the purpose, objective and meaning of healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding the ever-changing fields of [[biotechnology]], medicine, and [[nursing]]. And seeing that healthcare typically ranks as one of the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[allied health professional]]s, hospital administrators, [[health insurance]] companies ([[HMO]]s and [[Preferred provider organization|PPO]]s), the government ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]), and lastly, the patients themselves.

==Ethics of healthcare==
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|[[Hippocrates]], the ancient Greek physician, considered the father of [[Western medicine]].]]

The ethical and/or moral premises of healthcare are complex and intricate. To consolidate such a large segment of [[moral philosophy]], it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, it can be said that healthcare itself is a "''special''" institution within society.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, healthcare ought to "be treated differently from other social goods" in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a [[coma]], then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that "elsewhere" has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.

===Medical ethics===
{{Further|Medical ethics}}
Whereas [[bioethics]] tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of [[Hippocrates]], and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund D. Pellegrino, "The Philosophy of Medicine Reborn" (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds "the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brock, "Quality of Life Measures in Health Care and Medical Ethics," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Terms like [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Therefore, it becomes important to acquire a basic grasp of the varying dynamics that go into a doctor-patient relationship.

===Nursing ethics===
{{Further|Nursing ethics}}
Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, "nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning," whereby it is "the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Janie Butts and Karen Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) endorses an ethical code that emphasizes "values" and "evaluative judgments" in all areas of the nursing profession.&lt;ref&gt;Butts and Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = M |last2 = Heath | first2 = I |last3 = Howick | first3 = J |last4 = Greenhalgh | first4 = T | title = The importance of values in evidence-based medicine | doi = 10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 16 | issue = 69 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fulford | first1 = KWM |last2 = Peile | first2 = H |last3 = Carroll | first3 = H | title = Essential Values-Based Practice | isbn = 9780521530255 | url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/medicine/medicine-general-interest/essential-values-based-practice-clinical-stories-linking-science-people }}&lt;/ref&gt; And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision.

===Business ethics===
{{Further|Health economics}}
Balancing the cost of care with the quality of care is a major issue in healthcare philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments play a major role in determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health insurance corporations as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," but "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" and "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" regardless of health insurance status.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare [[cost-benefit analysis]]. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield]] employ large numbers of [[actuary|actuaries]] (colloquially known as "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/30/business/la-fi-health-insurance-20100730 Actuaries, HMOs, and State Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows:{{quotation|The least costly treatment should be provided unless there is substantial evidence that a more costly intervention is likely to yield a superior outcome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This generalized rule for healthcare institutions "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of [[stewardship]] of resources," especially since "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; And lastly, [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] have been cited as major precipitants of increasing healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headaches.about.com/cs/advocacy/a/lamus_cala.htm Are Frivolous Lawsuits Driving Up Healthcare Costs?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy of healthcare==
{{Further|Health care politics}}
In the [[political philosophy]] of healthcare, the debate between [[universal healthcare]] and [[private healthcare]] is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives by the federal government to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]], the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of [[socialized medicine]], many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage.&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does It Mean?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013858/http://cesr.org/ushealthright |date=27 September 2007 }} (29 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.&lt;ref name="LeonardPeikoff"&gt;Leonard Peikoff, [http://afcm.org/hcinar2.html "Health Care Is Not a Right,"] (11 December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Medicare.gif|thumb|right|500px|U.S. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (2008)]]

===Patients' Bill of Rights===
{{Further|U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights}}
In 2001, the U.S. federal government took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended ideas of the [[Consumer Bill of Rights|Consumers' Bill of Rights]] with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken in an effort to ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html Summary of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414202540/http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many [[interest group]]s, including the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[Pharmaceutical lobby|Big Pharma]] came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of [[health insurance]] status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"/&gt; As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2002.

===Health insurance===
[[File:Tommydouglas1945.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tommy Douglas|Tommy Douglas']] (centre left)  number one concern was the creation of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canadian Medicare]]. In the summer of 1962,  [[Saskatchewan]] became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's  physicians, who brought things to a halt with a doctors' strike.]]
{{Further|Health insurance}}
Health insurance is the primary mechanism through which individuals cover healthcare costs in [[industrialized countries]]. It can be obtained from either the [[government|public]] or [[corporation|private]] sector of the economy. In Canada, for example, the [[Canadian provinces|provincial governments]] administer public health insurance coverage to citizens and permanent residents. According to Health Canada, the political philosophy of public insurance in Canada is as follows:{{quotation|The administration and delivery of health care services is the responsibility of each province or territory, guided by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]]. The provinces and territories fund these services with assistance from the federal government in the form of fiscal transfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php Provincial/Territorial Role in Health]&lt;/ref&gt;}} And the driving force behind such a political philosophy in Canada was [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] politician [[Tommy Douglas]].

Contrasting with the U.S., but similar to Canada, Australia and New Zealand have [[universal healthcare]] systems known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and ACC ([[Accident Compensation Corporation]]), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/ Medicare Australia][http://www.acc.co.nz/index.htm ACC Government Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Medicare originated with [[Health Insurance Act 1973]]. It was introduced by Prime Minister (PM) [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Labor Government, and was intended to provide affordable treatment by doctors in public hospitals for all resident citizens. Redesigned by PM [[Bob Hawke]] in 1984, the current Medicare system permits citizens the option to purchase private health insurance in a [[two-tier health care|two-tier health system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/nphc-draftreportsupp-toc~nphc-draftreportsupp-ch3#.T2JX3GJWpss Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Considering the rapid pace at which the fields of medicine and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the [[phenomenon]], from which the research question is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research [[methodology]], design, and methods to fulfill the purposes of the research."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," ''Beyond Method: Philosophical Conversations in Healthcare Research and Scholarship'' Ed. Pamela M. Ironside (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her scientific inquiries rather than the research itself. Even so, "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', fixed and unchanging."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, viewpoints on scientific inquiries into healthcare matters "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical trials===
{{Further|Clinical trials}}
Clinical trials are a means through which the healthcare industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device. The traditional methodology behind clinical trials consists of various phases in which the emerging product undergoes a series of intense tests, most of which tend to occur on interested and/or compliant patients. The U.S. government has an established network for tackling the emergence of new products in the healthcare industry. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from [[pharmaceutical]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/7086fnl.htm Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers in Exploratory Drug Studies (FDA January 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the FDA, the [[National Institutes of Health]] sets the guidelines for all kinds of clinical trials relating to [[infectious diseases]]. For cancer, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) sponsors a series or cooperative groups like [[CALGB]] and [[Children's Oncology Group|COG]] in order to standardize protocols for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/overview/mission Mission Statement of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ogco fda 1006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (2006)]]

===Quality assurance===
{{Further|Quality assurance}}
The primary purpose of quality assurance (QA) in healthcare is to ensure that the quality of patient care is in accordance with established guidelines. The government usually plays a significant role in providing structured guidance for treating a particular disease or ailment. However, protocols for treatment can also be worked out at individual healthcare institutions like hospitals and HMOs. In some cases, quality assurance is seen as a superfluous endeavor, as many healthcare-based QA organizations, like [[QARC]], are publicly funded at the hands of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"&gt;[http://www.qarc.org/ Quality Assurance Review Center]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people would agree that healthcare quality assurance, particularly in the areas cancer treatment and disease control are necessary components to the vitality of any legitimate healthcare system. With respect to quality assurance in cancer treatment scenarios, the [[Quality Assurance Review Center]] (QARC) is just one example of a QA facility that seeks "to improve the standards of care" for patients "by improving the quality of clinical trials medicine."&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"/&gt;

==Birth and death==

===Reproductive rights===
{{Further|Abortion}}
The [[ecophilosophy]] of [[Garrett Hardin]] is one perspective from which to analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since they do a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', Hardin states,{{quotation|To couple the concept of [[liberty|freedom]] to breed with the belief that everyone born has an equal right to the commons is to lock the world into a tragic course of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html Garrett Hardin, "Freedom to Breed is Intolerable," ''The Tragedy of the Commons'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} By encouraging the freedom to breed, the [[welfare state]] not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one particular method to mitigate healthcare costs. With respect to population growth, the fewer people there are to take care of, the less expensive healthcare will be. And in applying this [[logic]] to what medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber previously suggested, less expensive healthcare does not necessarily mean poorer quality healthcare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Birth and living===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The concept of being "''well-born''" is not new, and may carry racist undertones. The [[Nazis]] practiced [[eugenics]] in order to cleanse the gene pool of what were perceived to be unwanted or harmful elements. This "race hygiene movement in Germany evolved from a [[theory]] of [[Social Darwinism]], which had become popular throughout Europe" and the United States during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'' (Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2005), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A German phrase that embodies the nature of this practice is ''lebensunwertes Leben'' or "life unworthy of life."&lt;ref&gt;Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with healthcare philosophy, the theory of [[natural rights]] becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed with a series of natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher [[John Locke]]. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states,{{quotation|If God's purpose for me on [[Earth]] is my survival and that of my species, and the means to that survival are my life, health, liberty and property — then clearly I don't want anyone to violate my rights to these things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/#HumNatGodPur John Locke, "Human Nature and God's Purposes," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although partially informed by his [[religion|religious]] understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a [[human rights|human right]] becomes relevant.

The process of preserving and maintaining one's health throughout life is a matter of grave concern. At some point in every person's life, his or her health is going to decline regardless of all measures taken to prevent such a collapse. Coping with this inevitable decline can prove quite problematic for some people. For [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], the depressing and gerontological implications of [[aging]] pushed him to believe in the prospects of [[immortality]] through a wholesome [[faith]] in the possibilities of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#PosHumFre René Descartes, "Possibility and Human Freedom," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and dying===
{{Further|Euthanasia}}
One of the most basic human rights is the right to live, and thus, preserve one's life. Yet one must also consider the right to die, and thus, end one's life. Often, religious values of varying traditions influence this issue. Terms like "mercy killing" and "assisted suicide" are frequently used to describe this process. Proponents of [[euthanasia]] claim that it is particularly necessary for patients suffering from a terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callahan, "Terminating Life-Sustaining Treatment of the Demented," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of a self-chosen death purport that it is not only immoral, but wholly against the pillars of reason.

In a certain philosophical context, death can be seen as the ultimate [[Existential crisis|existential]] moment in one's life. Death is the deepest cause of a primordial [[anxiety]] (''Die Anfechtung'') in a person's life. In this emotional state of anxiety, "the Nothing" is revealed to the person. According to twentieth-century [[Germans|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]],{{quotation|The Nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?" ''Basic Writings'' Ed. David Krell (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;}} And thus, for Heidegger, humans finds themselves in a very precarious and fragile situation (constantly hanging over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]]) in this world. This concept can be simplified to the point where at bottom, all that a person has in this world is his or her [[Being]]. Regardless of how individuals proceed in life, their existence will always be marked by [[wikt:finitude|finitude]] and [[solitude]]. When considering near-death experiences, humans feels this primordial anxiety overcome them. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize the onset of this entrenched [[wiktionary:despair|despair]] in patients who are nearing their respective deaths.

Other philosophical investigations into death examine the healthcare's profession heavy reliance on science and technology (SciTech). This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang [[allusion]] to this reliance in what he calls the allure or "character of exactness."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?," 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, people are inherently attached to "exactness" because it gives them a sense of purpose or reason in a world that is largely defined by what appears to be [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and irrationality. And as the moment of death is approaching, a moment marked by utter confusion and fear, people frantically attempt to pinpoint a final sense of meaning in their lives.

Aside from the role that SciTech plays in death, [[palliative care]] constitutes a specialized area of healthcare philosophy that specifically relates to patients who are terminally ill. Similar to [[hospice]] care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. Even though the terms "'''palliative'''" and "'''hospice'''" are typically used interchangeably, they are actually quite different. As a patient nears the end of his life, it is more comforting to be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. Palliative care has generally been reserved for those who have a [[terminal illness]]. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capc.org/palliative-care-across-the-continuum/ "Palliative Care across the Continuum" ''Center to Advance Palliative Care'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role development==
The manner in which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators interact is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers can be seen as being in a privileged position, whereby they have the power to alter the patients' quality of life. And yet, there are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise. Effects stemming from a "gender gap" between nurses and doctors are detrimental to the professional environment of a hospital workspace.&lt;ref&gt;Mary W. Stewart, "The Social Context of Professional Nursing," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}
The '''problem of induction''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] question of whether [[inductive reasoning]] leads to [[knowledge]] understood in the [[Justified true belief|classic philosophical sense]],&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#CanIndJus "Can induction be justified?"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

# Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that "all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white", before the discovery of [[black swan]]s) or
# Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the [[laws of physics]] will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |title=''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9662/pg9662.txt |work=Gutenberg Press }}#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem calls into question all [[empirical]] claims made in everyday life or through the [[scientific method]], and, for that reason, the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] said that "induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy." Although the problem arguably dates back to the [[Pyrrhonism]] of [[ancient philosophy]], as well as the [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], [[David Hume]] popularized it in the mid-18th century.

== Formulation of the problem ==
[[File:Buck Creek IN - sunrise.jpg|thumb|Usually inferred from repeated observations: ''"The sun always rises in the east"''.]]
[[File:Vainaja kannethaan.jpg|thumb|Usually not inferred from repeated observations: ''"If someone dies, it's never me"''.]]
In [[inductive reasoning]], one makes a series of observations and [[inference|infers]] a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, [[David Hume]] would even argue that we cannot claim it is "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated this point in ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'':

{{Cquote
| quote = Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
| 2 = 
}}

In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;This story is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient and early modern origins===
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic [[Sextus Empiricus]] first questioned the validity of inductive reasoning, positing that a universal rule could not be established from an incomplete set of particular instances. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite.}}

The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the [[circular reasoning]] of induction. However, Weintraub claims in [[The Philosophical Quarterly]]&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460-470&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''ad infinitum''.}}

Although the [[regress argument|criterion argument]] applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument "is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular." She concludes that "Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction." She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern [[foundationalism]].

The [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]], a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, pg 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dasgupta - A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century Indian skeptic, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa|Jayarasi Bhatta]], also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Balcerowicz, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/ "Jayarāśi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of Jayarāśi's Scepticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[William of Ockham]] connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232-3, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duns Scotus]] however argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings'', trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh:, 1962), 109-10; Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 17th-century [[Jesuits]] argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 223-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume &lt;!--'Hume's scepticism about induction' and 'Hume's skepticism about induction' redirect here--&gt;===
Few philosophers are as associated with induction as [[David Hume]]. He described the problem in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', §4, based on his [[epistemology|epistemological]] framework. Here, "reason" refers to [[deductive reasoning]] and "induction" refers to [[inductive reasoning]].

First, Hume ponders the discovery of [[causality|causal relations]], which form the basis for what he refers to as "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another",&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually happen with the balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.

Next, Hume ponders the justification of induction. If all matters of fact are based on causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must be shown to be valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" and the proposition "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects".&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers to come up with a (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be [[begging the question]]. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.

In this way, the problem of induction is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived by induction, but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#JusInd The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction===
{{main|New riddle of induction}}
[[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled "The New Riddle of Induction". Goodman proposed the new [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast'' (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, "will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/grue.html Goodman’s original definition of grue]&lt;/ref&gt;) observed to be green before a certain time ''t'', or blue if observed after that time. The "new" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time ''t'' we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

– Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time ''t'').

– Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate "grue" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after ''t'', will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

Goodman, however, points out that the predicate "grue" only appears more complex than the predicate "green" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of "grue" and "bleen" (where bleen is blue before time ''t'', or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider "green" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are "entrenched" in our language.

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] offers a practical solution to this problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Nicholas Rescher]]|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: Quine (1969), ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'', Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim that only predicates that identify a "[[natural kind]]" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. [[Roy Bhaskar|R. Bhaskar]] also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the  possibility  of  a  reason for the predicate,  located  in  the  enduring  nature  of  something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Realist Theory of Science|last=Bhaskar|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-45494-0|location=New York|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green [[beryl]], made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===
{{See also|David Hume#Induction_and_causation|l1=David Hume on the problem of induction}}
Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the ''Enquiry'', titled "Skeptical solution of these doubts". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and "without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses."&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
[[David Stove]]'s argument for induction, based on the [[statistical syllogism]], was presented in the ''Rationality of Induction'' and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late [[Donald Cary Williams]] (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book ''The Ground of Induction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Cary Williams | title=The Ground of Induction | location=New York | publisher=Russell and Russell | year=1947 }}, {{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ |title=Donald Cary Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset "matches" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or "representative" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stove, ''The Rationality of Induction'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biting the Bullett: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inacessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taking into account by [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] by considering that to be built a concept must be reapplied, what demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction &lt;ref&gt;"One form of Skepticism about Induction", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) ''The Justification of the Induction''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently - ''contra'' Hume - some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, what would make some inductive procedure always possible.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa: ''Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy'', Appendix to Ch. V, CSP, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Karl Popper===
[[Karl Popper]], a [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], sought to solve the problem of induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification "begs for an authoritarian answer". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-06-131376-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', section 43&lt;/ref&gt; Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so  there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Foundations of Scientific Inference
| author = [[Wesley C. Salmon]]
| year = 1967
| pages = 26
| accessdate = 27 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=Critical rationalism: A restatement and defense |date=1994 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a [[justificationism|justification]] for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bullemore, [https://www.academia.edu/4154895/Some_Remarks_on_the_Pragmatic_Problem_of_Induction "Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction"], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sue Knight''' is an Australian philosopher, educator and academic whose research focuses on teaching reasoning skills and embedding philosophy within school curricula. She is the author of the Primary Ethics curriculum, which has been offered as an alternative to Scripture in New South Wales public schools for students from Kindergarten to Year 6 since 2010.

== Education ==
Knight was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Philosophy]] in 1978 from the [[University of Adelaide]] with a thesis examining "the problem of universals, a fundamental problem within Metaphysics".&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sueknight.com.au/About.html|title=About|website=www.sueknight.com.au|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 she earned a Bachelor of Education from the same university. After becoming interested in the work of [[Matthew Lipman]], Knight undertook an advanced training workshop at the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) founded by Dr Lipman at [[Montclair State University]], [[New Jersey]], USA.  The [[Philosophy for Children]] program aims to engage students of all ages (from kindergarten to the senior secondary) in philosophical inquiry.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

== Career ==
Knight's career has focused on development of justificatory reasoning skills and embedding philosophy within school curricula across the year levels.&lt;ref name="Primary Ethics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://primaryethics.com.au/sue-knight/|title=Dr Sue Knight, Curriculum Author|last=|first=|date=August 2018|website=Primary Ethics: Ethics Education for Children|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UofAdelaide-BonythonHall&amp;Conservatorium-front-Aug08.jpg|thumb|right|200px||University of Adelaide, Bonython Hall &amp; Conservatorium.]]   On her return to Australia, Knight took up academic positions first with the University of Adelaide and then with the University of South Australia's School of Education, holding both teach and research positions for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="Event"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/philosophy-in-the-classroom-introductory-training-formerly-level-1-tickets-46141024045#|title=About presenter Dr Knight: Philosophy in the Classroom Introductory Training (formerly Level 1)|last=|first=|date=10 August 2018|website=Eventbrite|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career focus has led to her involvement in writing South Australia's Senior Secondary Philosophy curriculum and she served as inaugural Chair of the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of South Australia's Philosophy Subject Advisory Committee.

Knight established and held the inaugural Chair of the South Australian Philosophy in Education Association, which is involved in primary and middle school education.

From 2006 to 2009 Knight held the joint editorship of ''Critical and Creative Thinking: The Australasian Journal of Philosophy in Education'' with Carol Collins.&lt;ref name=Event/&gt;

Other contributions Knight has made to the field of philosophy for children include:

* Membership of the Vincent Fairfax Family Fund's Ethical Development Working Group.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

'''Theosophy''', also known as '''Christian theosophy''' and '''Boehmian theosophy''', refers to a range of positions within [[Christianity]] which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of [[divinity]] and the origin and purpose of the universe.
They have been characterized as [[mystical]] and [[occult]]ist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forward, to the East: Mapthali Herz Imber's Perception of Kabbalah|last=Huss|first=Boaz|year=2013|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|page=398|doi=10.1080/14725886.2013.826464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy is considered part of [[Western esotericism]], which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and salvation.

The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher [[Jakob Böhme]].

In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the [[Theosophical Society]], an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt; "Following a period of obscurity, it was then revived at the end of the nineteenth century by the Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky" Partridge, C. (2013). Understanding the Dark Side. Chester: University of Chester. page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

==Etymology and terminology==
Theosophy comes from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|theosophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}), which combines ''{{lang|grc|theos}}'' (θεός), "God"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott: ''Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|grc|sophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|σοφία}}), "wisdom". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theosophy |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/theosophy |website=Encylopedia.com |publisher=Encylopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymological meaning is thus "wisdom of God."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} 

The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]]:{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name = "Lobel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''theosophoi'' are "those knowing divine things".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "theosophos" (θεόσοφος) "wise in divine things" was applied by [[Iamblichus]] to the [[gymnosophists]] (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian [[yogi]]s or [[sadhu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]] (''De mysteriis'' 7.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of esotericism such as [[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Antoine Faivre|Faivre]] differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by [[Helena Blavatsky]] by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt;

Antoine Faivre suggested that it be called "Boehmian theosophy".{{sfn|Faivre|1998|p=116}}

==Historical development==
{{see also|Transcendent theosophy}}
===Antiquity and medieval ending c. 1450 CE===
The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name = "Lobel" /&gt; The 13th century work ''[[Summa philosophiae]]'' attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]] made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Origen]] were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
During the [[Renaissance]], use of the term diverged to refer to [[gnostic]] knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century ''Theosophia'' by [[Johannes Arboreus]] provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.&lt;ref name="Faivre1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and [[Pietism]] arose in response to the orthodoxy of the [[Lutheran Reformation]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=87}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[I]n the first decades of the seventeenth century, the German cobbler Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) wrote an oeuvre of impressive depth and originality that has become foundational for one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism: Christian theosophy. In a heartfelt attempt to understand how a good God could have created a world so full of evil and suffering, Böhme developed a dramatic visionary cosmogony filled with alchemical and Paracelsian references, that described the 'birth of God' himself out of the unfathomable mysteries of the ''Ungrund''."|source=— Religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} }}

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic [[Jakob Boehme]] (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word "theosophy", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13, see also p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Boehme gave the word "theosophy" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating [[nature]] with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=10–11 Faivre's list of 17th century theosophers in North-Western Europe (including Germany) consists of roughly ten names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1618–1699), [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637), [[John Pordage]] (1608–1681), [[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), [[Henry More]] (1614–1687), [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646–1719), and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] (1616–1680).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=10-11 Henry More is added to the list by Faivre with some reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying [[active imagination]] in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OED|1989|}} v. XVII, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in [[ancient Egypt]], and to [[Neo-Platonism]], and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term "theosophy" was still "practically absent" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=47 (Diderot is the one exception Faivre mentions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Jakob Brucker]] (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work {{cite book|title=Historia critica philosophia}} (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word ''theosophy'' was often used in conjunction with {{clarify span|panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.|explain=panosophy vs. pansophy?|date=January 2015}} The term ''theosophy'' is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Robert Hindmarsh]], a printer with a Methodist background, formed a "Theosophical Society" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Hindmarsh, Robert, ''Rise and Progress of The New Jerusalem Church In England, America and Other Parts,'' Hoderson and Sons, London 1861; {{ISBN|1-4021-3146-1}}.

Groups such as the [[Martinist Order]] founded by [[Papus]] in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: "although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemeth IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that "Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=23}}

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the "theosophic current" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought  (i.e., [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], Neo-Alexandrian [[hermetism|Hermeticism]], [[Christian Kabbalah]], Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the "prognostications" of [[Paracelsus]]), [[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|philosophia occulta]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faivre noted that there are "obvious similarities" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier  theosophy "belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type", while that of modern Theosophy "reveals a more universal aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences "are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern theosophy retains its western Hermetic motive, logic and end.... The continuities are greater than the differences." Handbook of the Theosophical Current , Olav Hammer, Mikael Rothstein, BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9789004235977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. [[Antoine Faivre]] notes, "the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail."&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

''Theosophy'':
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind.  
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==

The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] described Christian theosophy as "one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} 

===Academic study===

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=31, also xxx.(Preface)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] and Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=6}}
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic ''Naturphilosophie'' and therefore creates an "ideal" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=11}}

{{Universalism|expanded=all}}
'''Universalism''' is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application or applicability.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A community that calls itself ''universalist'' may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner. It is centered around the belief in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For example, some forms of [[Abrahamic religions]] claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and "feel inclusive"{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--"claim universal value" is very different from "feel inclusive". What does the latter even mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'/&gt;

[[Christian Universalism]] is focused around the idea of [[universal reconciliation]]. Also known as universal salvation, it is a doctrine stating that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Otis Ainsworth Skinner (1807-1861), ''A Series of Sermons in Defense of the Doctrine of Universal Salvation'', Page 209, It is not part of mainline Christian doctrine either Catholic or Protestant. "Repentance is a means by which all men are brought into the enjoyment of religion, and we do expect any man will be saved while he continues in sin. However, Unitarian Universalism holds a universal salvation, because is, "we expect all men will repent."&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in Universalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the [[Rig Veda]] states, "Truth is one; sages call it by various names."&lt;ref&gt;[https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/harmony-of-religions/ Vedanta Society of Southern California ''Harmony of Religions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism has had an influence on modern day [[Hinduism]], in turn influencing western modern spirituality.{{sfn|King|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Unitarian Universalism]] emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality, and also focuses on the universal principles of most religions. They accept all religions in an inclusive manner.

==Philosophy==
===Universality===
{{Main|Universality (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, universality is the notion that universal facts can be discovered and is therefore understood as being in opposition to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). ''Anti-Racism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain religions, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe.

=== Moral universalism ===
{{Main|Moral universalism|Moral particularism}}
Moral universalism (also called ''moral objectivism'' or ''universal morality'') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] position that some system of [[ethics]] are applied [[universality (philosophy)|universally]]. That system is inclusive of all individuals,&lt;ref name=PhilPages&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm#unvby |title=A Dictionary of Philosophical Terms and Names |work=Philosophy Pages |first=Garth|last=Kemerling |date=November 12, 2011 |quote=According to [http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/kant.htm Immanuel Kant] and [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/h.htm#hare Richard Mervyn Hare]...moral imperatives must be regarded as equally binding on everyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other distinguishing feature.&lt;ref name=Gowans&gt;{{cite web |quote=Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that moral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or universal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes are justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false ones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and well-informed person. |first=Chris|last=Gowans |title=Moral Relativism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/ |date=Dec 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral universalism is opposed to [[moral nihilism]] and [[moral relativism]]. However, not all forms of moral universalism are [[moral absolutism|absolutist]], nor do they necessarily [[value monism]]. Many forms of universalism, such as [[utilitarianism]], are non-absolutist. Other forms such as those theorized by [[Isaiah Berlin]], may [[value pluralism|value pluralist ideals.]]

==Religion==

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
In Bahá'í belief, a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]]. As a result, the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose. In this view, there is unity among the founders of world religions, but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paradise and Paradigm: Key Symbols in Persian Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1999 |page=292 |last=Buck |first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this universal view, the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="Stockman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Stockman |title=Sourcebook of the World's Religions |isbn=1-57731-121-3 |publisher=New World Library |year=2000 |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Beversluis|chapter=The Baha'i Faith |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people with regard to race, colour or religion.&lt;ref name="Smith138"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockman" /&gt; Hence the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.&lt;ref name="Smith138" /&gt;

The teaching, however, does not equate unity with uniformity; instead the Bahá'í writings advocate the principle of ''unity in diversity'' where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards, and the inevitability of, [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="Smith-peace"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=peace |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is [[universal reconciliation]] – that all humans will eventually be saved. They will eventually enter God's kingdom in Heaven, through the grace and works of the lord [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=What Is Christian Universalism? |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal [[Hell]] does not exist, and that it was not what Jesus had taught. They point to historical evidence showing that some early fathers of the church were universalists, and attribute the perpetuating idea of hell to eternal mistranslation.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/ The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Amirault |url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html |title=The Fate of the Wicked |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they argue that an eternal hell is both unjust, and against the nature and attributes of a loving God.&lt;ref&gt;Guild, E.E. 'Arguments in Favour of Universalism'. http://www.tentmaker.org/books/InFavorCh20.html
http://godfire.net/eby/saviour_of_the_world.html
http://www.godfire.net/Hellidx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are generally compatible with the fundamentals of Christianity{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* [[God in Christianity|God]] is the loving Parent of all peoples, see [[Love of God]].
* [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] reveals the nature and character of God, and is the spiritual leader of humankind.
* Humankind is created with an [[immortal soul]], which death can not end—or a [[Christian mortalism|mortal soul]] that shall be resurrected and preserved by God. A soul which God will not wholly destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/TheBibleHell.html ''The Bible Hell'']. TentMaker.org. "The immortal soul is not meant, but the life. As though Jesus had said: "Fear Not those who can only kill the body, but rather him, who ''if he chose could'' destroy the soul"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian views on sin|Sin]] has negative consequences for the sinner either in this life or the [[afterlife]]. All of God's punishments for sin are corrective and remedial. None of such punishments will last forever, or result in the permanent destruction of a soul. Some Christian Universalists believe in the idea of a Purgatorial Hell, or a temporary place of purification that some must undergo before their entrance into Heaven.&lt;ref name="Scott2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Van Scott |title=The Encyclopedia of Hell: A Comprehensive Survey of the Underworld |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1EnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240 |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-4668-9119-7 |page=240 |chapter=Purgatorial Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the [[Universalist Church of America]], adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, the reality of sin and [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/prof.html |title=See section entitled "Five Principles of Faith" |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
{{See also|Universal reconciliation#History|l1=History of Universal Reconciliation}}
Universalist writers such as [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12/Page_96.html [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, 1953, vol. 12, p. 96; retrieved 30/04/09]&lt;/ref&gt; These included such important figures such as Alexandrian scholar [[Origen]] as well as [[Clement of Alexandria]], a Christian theologian. Origen and Clement both included the existence of a non-eternal Hell in their teachings. Hell was remedial, in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering into Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanrock.net/2015/05/20/purgatorial-hell-faq/ |title=Purgatorial Hell FAQ |publisher=StanRock.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first undisputed documentations of Christian Universalist ideas occurred in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe as well as in colonial America. Between 1648-1697 English activist [[Gerrard Winstanley]], writer [[Richard Coppin]], and dissenter [[Jane Leade]], each taught that God would grant all human beings salvation. The same teachings were later spread throughout 18th-century France and America by [[George de Benneville]]. People who taught this doctrine in America would later become known as the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyatt |first1=Neal |last2=Dwyer |first2=Tierney V |last3=Dwyer |first3=Tierney V |year=2008 |title=Unitarian Universalism: A Research Guide |url=|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=3|pages=210–214 |doi=10.5860/rusq.47n3.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''[[apocatastasis|apocatastas]]'' came to be related by some to the beliefs of [[Christian Universalism]], but central to the doctrine was the restitution, or restoration of all sinful beings to God, and to His state of blessedness.  In early [[Patristics]], usage of the term is distinct.

====Universalist theology====
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
{{religious text primary|section|date=February 2012}}
Universalist theology is grounded in history, scripture and assumptions about the nature of God. [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Whittemore]] wrote the book "100 Scriptural Proofs that Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/ScripturalProofs.html |title=100 Scriptural Proofs That Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoting both Old and New Testament verses which support the Universalist viewpoint.

Some Bible verses he cites and are cited by other Christian Universalists are:
# 1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;ref name="Tent"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Wicked|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html|work=tentmaker.org|publisher=Tentmaker|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Tentmaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "For as in Adam '''ALL''' die, so also in Christ shall '''ALL''' be made alive." ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]; emphasis added)
# 2 Peter 3:9
#* "'''The Lord''' is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, '''not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# 1 Timothy 2:3–6&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who '''wants all men to be saved''' and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for '''ALL''' men—the testimony given in its proper time." (NIV; emphasis added)
# 1 John 2:2
#* "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." (NIV)
# 1 Timothy 4:10&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the '''Savior of all people, especially of those who believe'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# Romans 11:32&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all." (NIV)

====Mistranslations====
Christian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as giving rise to the idea of Eternal Hell, and the idea that some people will not be saved.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tentmaker1"&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html "Eternal" Punishment (Matthew 25:46) Is NOT Found In The Greek New Testament.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carm.org/look-word-aionion A look at the word "aionion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Greek word is the origin of the modern English word [[aeon]], which refers to a period of time or an epoch.

The 19th century theologian [[Marvin Vincent]] wrote about the word ''aion'', and the supposed connotations of "eternal" or "temporal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Aion''', transliterated '''''aeon''''', is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. [...] Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of ''endless'' or ''everlasting''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=Marvin|title=Note on Olethron Aionion (eternal destruction)|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/vincent.html|work=Word Studies in the New Testament|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Ken Vincent writes that "When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, "aion" became "aeternam" which means "eternal".&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"/&gt;

====New Thought====
{{Main|New Thought}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
[[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Divine Science]] are denominations within the New Thought movement. Each teaches that there is a common thread of truth at the heart of all religions. New Thought is an ever-evolving belief system which will incorporate ''Truth'' where ever it is found, hence the name ''New Thought''. ''All is God, But God transcends all''.

====Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a theologically liberal religion characterized by a "free and responsible search for truth and meaning".&lt;ref&gt;(The 4th principle of Unitarian Universalism)[http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml UUA.org Seven principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists do not share a [[creed]]; rather, they are unified by their shared search for [[spiritual growth]] and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not a result of obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian Universalists draw from all major world religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Rastafarianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many different theological sources and have a wide range of beliefs and practices.

While having its origins in Christianity, UU is no longer a Christian church. As of 2006, fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=James Ishmael |title=Zen Master Who? |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |year=2006 |page=187 |isbn=0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief, whereby members may describe themselves as [[Humanism|humanist]], agnostic, [[deist]], [[atheist]], pagan, Christian, [[monotheist]], [[pantheism|pantheist]], [[polytheist]], or assume no label at all.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) was formed in 1961, a consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]], established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America,&lt;ref name="harvard1"&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1866. It is headquartered in [[Boston]], and mainly serves churches in the United States. The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] became an independent body in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;CUC-UUA Tradition. Canadian Unitarian Council [http://cuc.ca/who_we_are/cuc-uua_transition.htm Growing Vital Religious Communities In Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-religious Universalism=====
Universalism is not only a set of values, but a worldview to which any can subscribe if they observe and believe in the universality of the human experience—and that of all sentient life—and work to uphold the principles, ethics, and actions that safeguard these fundamental things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/unitarianuniversalism.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many Universalists may be attracted to the logic of universally applicable principles, rather than any belief or dogma. Human unity, solidarity, and the perceived need for a sustainable and socially conscious global order are among the tendencies of non-religious Universalist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/u-u.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Author David Frawley says that Hinduism has a "background universalism" and its teachings contain a "universal relevance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haindavakeralam.com/pluralism-and-universalism-within-hinduism-david-frawley-hk5500 ''Pluralism and Universalism Within Hinduism''] "Hindu teachings were also denigrated accordingly and the deeper philosophies of Hinduism were often ignored, especially their universal relevance. For conversion purposes it was easier to define Hinduism in a limited way as a local phenomenon only. Yet the universality of Hindu teachings continued, though few outside of India understood this until recent years. This background universalism of Sanatana Dharma affords Hinduism a synthetic tendency, an ability to incorporate within itself a diversity of views and approaches, including at times those from groups outside of Hinduism or even opposed to Hinduism. Because of this syncretic view, sometimes Hinduism is equated with a blind universalism that accepts without discrimination anything that calls itself religious or spiritual, as if differences of spiritual teachings did not matter in any way. While this may be true of some Hindus, the Hindu tradition also contains a lively tradition of free debate on all aspects of theology, philosophy and metaphysics, showing differences as well as similarities, and not simply equating all teachings as they are. A good example of this is the debates between the dualistic and non-dualistic schools of Vedantic philosophy, but many other examples exist as well. The different sects within Hinduism have always been free to disagree, though each sect has its particular guidelines and there is an overall respect for Dharma."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] is also naturally [[Religious pluralism|religiously pluralistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation "Hinduism Basics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously."&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: "As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 211. {{ISBN|0-87395-831-4}}, which translates the same passage as "They who, in whatever way, take refuge in Me, them I reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) {{ISBN|1-884852-04-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions, it also has a wide range of diversity within it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation ''Hinduism Basics'' "It is a richly diverse family of philosophies, traditions, and practices that have been followed primarily throughout Asia for thousands of years."]&lt;/ref&gt; There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://veden-akademie.de/index.php?article_id=154&amp;clang=1 "Shat-darshana: The Philosophical Schools of Sanatana Dharma"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple unorthodox or "hetrodox" traditions called [[darshanas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearias.com/indian-philosophy-schools/ ''Indian Philosophy: Orthodox and Heterodox Schools'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Universalism====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu reform movements}}
''Hindu Universalism'', also called ''Neo-Vedanta''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neo-Hinduism'',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and [[orientalism]]. It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith|year=2007|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|isbn=1934145009|page=416|author=Editors of Hinduism Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} For example, it presents that:
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Rigveda 1:164:46) "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti" - Truth is one; sages call it many names&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Maha Upanishad: Chapter 6, Verse 72) "[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]" - The entire world is a one big family&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Badlani |first=Hiro |title=Hinduism: Path of the Ancient Wisdom |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8NrQhyxH-GgC |isbn=978-0-595-70183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was [[Ram Mohan Roy]], who established the [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Ghazi|2010}} Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]]{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Veneration for all other religions was articulated by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]:
{{quote|After long study and experience, I have come to the conclusion that [1] all religions are true; [2] all religions have some error in them; [3] all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism, in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives. My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith; therefore no thought of conversion is possible.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, ''All Men Are Brothers: Life and Thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi as told in his own words'', Paris, UNESCO 1958, p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation, regarding Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{Citation not found}}

===Islam===
{{Further|Ummah|Divisions of the world in Islam|People of the Book|Dhimmi|Dawah|}}
{{Original Research|date=June 2018}}
Islam recognizes to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Quran]] identifying Jews, Christians, and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandaeans]]) as "people of the Book" (''ahl al-kitab''). Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include [[Zoroastrians]], and later even Hindus, as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion, but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews, Christians, and [[Sabians]] as People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone|first=Patricia|title=God's Rule: Government and Islam: Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political Thought|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13291-6|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2015}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lapidus|first1=Ira M.|title=Ira M.

There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism. According to the most inclusive teachings, common among the [[liberal Muslim movements]], all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation. For example, Surah 2:62,256 states that:&lt;ref&gt;1. S. A. Rahman, Punishment of Apostasy in Islam, Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} {{quote|Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve...let there be no compulsion in religion}}

However, the most exclusive teachings disagree. For example, the [[Salafi]] refer to Surah 9:5,29:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} {{quote|Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters [''mushrikun''] wherever ye find them, and take them, and besiege them, and lay in wait in every stratagem of war. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the ''Zakat'', then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful [...] Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture [i.e. people of the book] as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the ''jizya'' readily, being brought low [in submission].}}

The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought, traditionalist and reform-minded, and branches of Islam, from the reforming [[Quranism]] and [[Ahmadiyya]] to the ultra-traditionalist [[Salafi]], as is the doctrine of abrogation (''[[Naskh (tafsir)|naskh]]'') which is used to determine which verses take precedence, based on reconstructed chronology, with later verses superseding earlier ones. The traditional chronology places Surah 9 as the last or second-to-last surah revealed, thus, in traditional exegesis, it gains a large power of abrogation, and verses 9:5,29,73 are held to have abrogated 2:256&lt;ref name="Ibn Kathir 2000 6608"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail (1301-1373)|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Aziz (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)|year=2000|publisher=Maktaba Darussalam|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|isbn=978-1-59144-020-8|page=6608|edition=English Abridged|editor=Sheikh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ahadith also play a major role in this, and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith, with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections, generally along with the [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]. Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions, the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely, from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith, to the Salafi, or ''ahl al-hadith'', who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on religious pluralism}}
{{See also|Noahidism}}
Judaism teaches that God [[Jews as the chosen people|chose the Jewish people]] to be in a unique covenant with God, and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the [[Torah]] with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations. This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as [[Noahidism|Noachides]], and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God, as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polish |first1=David |year=1985 |title=Covenant-Jewish Universalism and Particularism |journal=Judaism |volume=34 |issue=3 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An on-line organization, the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by [[Steven Blane]], who calls himself an "American Jewish Universalist Rabbi", believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism, stating that "God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world, and we have much to learn and share with each other. We can only accomplish [[Tikkun Olam]] by our unconditional acceptance of each other's peaceful doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Universalism|url=http://www.jsli.net/jewish-universalism|work=Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}
Manichaeism, like Christian [[Gnosticism]] and [[Zurvanism]], was inherently universalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manichaeism in the Early Sasanian Empire|author=Manfred Hutter |date=January 1993|publisher=BRILL|jstor=3270395|volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

===Sikhism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
}}
In [[Sikhism]], all the religions of the world are compared to rivers flowing into a single ocean. Although the [[Sikh gurus]] did not agree with the practices of [[fasting]], [[idolatry]] and pilgrimage during their times, they stressed that all religions should be tolerated and considered on equal footing. The Sikh scripture, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], contains the writings of not just the Sikh guru themselves, but the writings of several Hindu and Muslim saints, known as the ''[[Bhagat]]s''. 

The very first word of the Sikh scripture is "Ik", followed by "Oh-ang-kar". This literally means that there is only one god, and that one is wholesome, inclusive of the whole universe. It further goes on to state that all of creation, and all energy is part of this primordial being. As such, it is described in scripture over and over again, that all that occurs is part of the divine will, and as such, has to be accepted. It occurs for a reason, even if its beyond the grasp of one person to understand.

Although Sikhism does not teach that men are created as an [[image of God]], it states that the essence of the One is to be found throughout all of its creation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As was said by Yogi Bhajan, the man who is credited with having brought Sikhism to the West:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all". (Sri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhdharma.org/about-the-siri-singh-sahib-yogi-bhajan/|title=About the Siri Singh Sahib – Sikh Dharma International|website=www.sikhdharma.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]] said himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/There_is_no_Hindu_and_no_Musalman|title=There is no Hindu and no Musalman - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm|title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People|website=www.sikhs.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/gurunanakforchildren/chapter4/#No%20Hindu,%20and%20no%20Muslim|title=Guru Nanak (for Children) - No Hindu, and no Muslim|last=Munde |first=Amarpreet Singh|website=www.gurmat.info|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this, Guru Nanak meant that there is no distinction between religion in God's eyes, whether polytheist, monotheist, [[pantheist]], or even atheist, all that one needs to gain salvation is purity of heart, tolerance of all beings, compassion and kindness. Unlike many of the major world religions, Sikhism does not have [[proselytism|missionaries]], instead it believes men have the freedom to find their own path to [[salvation]].

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
Some varieties of Zoroastrian (such as [[Zurvanism]]) are universalistic in application to all races, but not necessarily universalist in the sense of universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Porter Berkey ''The formation of Islam: religion and society in the Near East'' 2003 p28 "This is not to say that there was no universalist dimension to Zoroastrian religious life; but what universalism there was derived directly, and to a greater degree than in the case of Rome and Christianity, from the explicit connection between religion and the state."&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2015}}

==Critics==
In his book ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God'', the Australian philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] noted that whilst in the past a miracle performed by Jesus had served as proof to Christians that he was the 'one true God', and that a miracle performed by another religion's deity had served as a (contradictory) proof to its own adherents, the universalist approach resulted in any such miracle being accepted as a validation of all religions, a situation that he characterised as "Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Mackie |author-first1=J. L. |title=The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=November 1982 |isbn=978-0198246824|quote="It is no longer 'The heathen in his blindness…', but rather 'We worship the same god, but under different names and in different ways’.

It is as if someone had coined the slogan, Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Wonderism''' is a term coined by French sinologist [[Terrien de Lacouperie]] (1845-1894) to differentiate the proto-Daoism of [[Jixia Academy]] from the philosophical [[Daoism]] of [[Laozi]], although his ideas were received with skepticism at the time of assertion [[Albert_Étienne_Jean_Baptiste_Terrien_de_Lacouperie#Evaluations_of_Terrien.27s_theories|and have since been discredited by modern sinology]].{{elaboration needed|reason=linked section does not mention this idea|date=December 2016}}

Lacouperie believed that Chinese civilization was influenced by early sea traders from the [[Erythraean Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]] who established a settlement in [[East China]] circa 675 BCE. It was located in the [[Zhou Dynasty]] state of [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]] 齊 (present day [[Shandong]] Province) at Langye 琅琊 (near [[Linyi]]) and [[Jimo, Shandong|Jimo]] 即墨 (northeast and southwest of [[Jiaozhou Bay]]). In the history of [[Ancient Chinese coinage]], Jimo was an important mint where large bronze [[knife money]] called "Qi knives" were manufactured.&lt;ref&gt; Albert Étienne Terrien de Lacouperie (1892), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xZAUAAAAYAAJ Catalogue of Chinese coins from the VIIth cent. B.C. to A.D. 621, Including the Series in the British Museum], Gilbert and Rivington, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;These foreigners, Sabaeans, Syrians and Hindus introduced new notions, such as astrology and superstitions, and by their sailors' yarns awakened a curiosity for the wonderful. The social and political condition of the country was favourable to a movement of this sort. The Chinese princes were anxious of novelty to show their independence from the once respected and now disregarded suzerainty of the Kings of Chou. It was really an age of wonderism.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1892), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0QULAAAAYAAJ The Oldest Book of the Chinese, the Yh-king, and its Authors], D. Nutt, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Lacouperie, this [[school of thought]] combined with early philosophical Daoism to create religious Daoism. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The school of Wonderism, which had grown out of the influence of the trader-colonists of the Indian Ocean settled at Lang-ya and Tsih-Moh who had taught Astrology and an overrated conception of the transforming powers of nature, amalgamated with the pure Taoism of Lao-tze, and formed henceforth what may be called the Neo-Taoism or Tao-szeism, while Confucianism remained in opposition to it, such as his founder had conceived it against the encroachments of Wonderism, Taoism, and Shamanism. It was indeed the rising of Confucianism which led to the fusion of these various elements. &lt;ref&gt;Albert Étienne Terrien de Lacouperie (1894), [https://archive.org/details/westernoriginofe00terrrich Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilisation from 2300 B.C. to 200 A.D.: or, Chapters on the Elements Derived from the old Civilisations of West Asia in the Formation of the Ancient Chinese Culture], Asher &amp; Co., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This terminology is outmoded. "Taoszeism" (from the French [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] ''tao-sze'' for ''daoshi'' 道士 "Daoist master, Daoist priest/priestess") was used by [[Léon de Rosny]] in reference to religious Daoism. "Neotaoism" or "Neodaoism" usually refers to [[Xuanxue]] 玄學 (lit. "arcane studies").

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
