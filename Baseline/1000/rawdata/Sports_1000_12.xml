By 1600, rural folk in [[Great Britain]] had begun to play early versions of [[cricket]], [[football]] and [[golf]]. Early in the 16th century, English public houses were showing interest in [[bowls]] and [[real tennis]], as well as dice and cards, all of which the government tried to eliminate forcefully. According to [[Derek Birley]], it was late in the 16th century that "licensing began to replace prohibition ... a public house might be licensed to allow men of substance to engage in dice, cards, tables, bowls, and tennis on condition that there was no blaspheming or swearing, and no play before noon on working days or during hours of religious worship on Sundays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum |pages=4–5 |isbn=1-85410-710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Bandy]]==
'''Events'''
* c.1001–c.1100 — games that are accepted as direct predecessors to bandy have been recorded in Russian monastery records dating back to this period.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* Having been popular in both [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], boxing was apparently in centuries-long decline following the rise of Christianity after the fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="EncyclopaediaBritannicaEntry"&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Poliakoff |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-29781/boxing |title=Encyclopædia Britannica entry for Boxing |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Creag"==
'''Speculation'''
* 10 March 1301&lt;ref name=LTL1300&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1300.html#1300 |title=From Lads to Lord's – 1300 |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153251/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1300.html#1300 |archivedate=10 October 2012}} Quotes the precise date of the accounting entry as Thursday, 10 March 1300 (Julian date), which is in the Gregorian year of 1301.&lt;/ref&gt; — an expenses paid item in the English royal accounts confirms that the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]], then aged 15, was playing a game called ''creag'' at [[Newenden]], [[Kent]]. Despite speculation that ''creag'' was an early form of [[cricket]], there is no supportive evidence and it is much more likely that the word is an early spelling of [[craic]], meaning "fun and games" in general, though it does confirm that games were being played, if only among aristocrats, at the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=LTL1300/&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 11th to 13th centuries — the most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it developed among children in south-east England sometime before 1300.&lt;ref name=LTL1300/&gt;
* 17 January 1597&lt;ref name=LTL1597&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1300.html#1597 |title=From Lads to Lord's – 1597 |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153251/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1300.html#1597 |archivedate=October 10, 2012}} Quotes the precise date of the court case as Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date), which is in the Gregorian year of 1598.&lt;/ref&gt; — a court of law in [[Guildford]] heard from a 59-year-old [[coroner]], [[John Derrick]], who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the "Free School at Guildford", fifty years earlier, "{{sic|hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play at creckett and other plaies}}" on common land which was the subject of the current legal dispute, confirming that the sport was played there by schoolboys c.1550. It is perhaps significant that cricket is the only one of the "plaies" to be specifically named.&lt;ref name=JM19&gt;{{cite book |last=Major |first=John |authorlink=John Major |title=More Than A Game |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |page=19 |isbn=978-0-00-718364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DU3&gt;{{cite book |last=Underdown |first=David |authorlink=David Underdown |title=Start of Play |year=2000 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |page=3 |isbn=0-713-99330-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LTL1597/&gt;
* 1598 – reference to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by [[John Florio|Giovanni Florio]]. His definition of the word ''sgillare'' is: "to make a noise as a [[cricket (insect)|cricket]], to play ''cricket-a-wicket'', and be merry"; Florio is the first writer known to have defined "cricket" in terms of both an insect and a game.&lt;ref name=Florio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/florio/ |title=Queen Anna's New World of Words, f. 144 and f. 198 |date=1611 |first=Giovanni |last=Florio |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Curling]]==
'''Events'''
* 1511 — evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at [[Dunblane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002022.asp |title=Wooden Curling Stone |publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]] |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 1541 — the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice comes from the records of [[Paisley Abbey]], [[Renfrewshire]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* 1565 — two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] depict Dutch peasants curling.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* Medieval England — huge rise in popularity of annual [[Shrovetide football]] matches, sometimes referred to as "[[mob football]]", which were played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash ''en masse'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sportmatters"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=88 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1308 — football was played at [[Newcastle, County Down]], where a spectator was stabbed during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |title=Irish inventions: fact and fiction |publisher=Carlow-nationalist.ie |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729154246/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Golf]]==
'''Theory of origin'''
* 12th century — the most widely accepted theory is that golf (as practiced today) originates from [[Scotland]] in the 12th century with shepherds knocking stones into rabbit holes on the site now occupied by the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club]] of [[St Andrews]]. The real origin of golf, however, is uncertain and open to debate.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==

'''1814 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Bandy]]==
'''Events'''
* The first recorded games of bandy take place in the [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] during the great frost of 1813–14, but it is probable that the game has been played there since the previous century.  A feature of the Fens is that large expanses of ice form on flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters and skating is a tradition.  Bury Fen bandy club from Bluntisham-cum-Earith, near [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], is the most successful team, remaining unbeaten until 1890–91.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship but no fights involving him are recorded in 1814, although he does stage an exhibition of sparring for the [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}.  Retrieved on 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The site of [[Lord's Middle Ground]] is requisitioned by Parliament for the building of the [[Regent's Canal]].  [[Thomas Lord]] contacts the Eyre family, erstwhile owners of the ground, and persuades them to lease to him another parcel of land in [[St John's Wood]], about half a mile further north at a place called North Bank.  This site has previously been a duckpond.  In the winter of 1813-14, Lord again has his turf literally dug up and removed.  He builds a high perimeter fence, a tavern and a pavilion at what is now [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] (Lord's).  
* On 22 June 1814, [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) plays the first match at Lord's against Hertfordshire, then as now a minor county.  
* The first match of importance at Lord's is played 13–15 July 1814 when MCC takes on a team called St John's Wood that includes a number of [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] players including [[Billy Beldham]], [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] and [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]].
* [[Jem Broadbridge]] makes his debut in [[first-class cricket]].
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] 126 (HS 59*)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] and [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] 11 apiece

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* Inaugural running of the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Charlotte (horse)|Charlotte]]
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Olive 
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Blucher (horse)|Blucher]] 
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Medora (horse)|Medora]]
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[William (horse)|William]]

The '''Amateur Sports Act of 1978''', signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]], established the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and provides for national governing bodies for each [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=30133 |title= Jimmy Carter: "Amateur Sports Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2727 Into Law. ," November 8, 1978 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act provides important legal protection for individual athletes.&lt;ref&gt;36 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 220501&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the adoption of the Act in 1978, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) represented the United States on international competition matters and regulated amateur sports generally. The AAU had adopted arbitrary rules which prohibited women from participating in running events and prohibited any runner who had raced in the same event as a runner with a shoe-company sponsorship. Congress adopted the Act in response to criticisms of the AAU, effectively removing that organization from any governance role.

The AAU now continues as a voluntary organization largely promoting youth sports. While it still has a major role in promoting track, it is now best known for sponsoring youth basketball competitions.

==Overview==
The Act charters the U.S. Olympic Committee, which in turn can charter a national governing body (NGB) for each sport, such as [[USA Swimming]], the [[United States Fencing Association]], the [[United States Ski Team]], [[USA Track &amp; Field]], [[USA Shooting]], or the [[U.S. Figure Skating]]. Each NGB in turn establishes the rules for selecting the United States Olympic Team and promotes amateur competition in that sport.

The Act requires that active athletes (defined as amateur athletes who have represented the United States in international amateur competition within the last ten years) must hold 20 percent of the voting power of any board or committee in an NGB. The Act also provides athletes with due process and appeal rights concerning eligibility disputes. 

The Act gives exclusive rights of usage of the words ''Olympic'' and ''[[Olympiad]]'' to the Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/220506-|title=36 U.S. Code § 220506 - Exclusive right to name, seals, emblems, and badges|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee used this act to sue other organizations which used this term "Olympics", such as the [[Gay Olympics]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927082357/http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1998 Revision ==
The '''Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act''' is a [[United States]] law (codified at 36 U.S.C. Sec. 220501 et seq. of the [[United States Code]]) that charters and grants monopoly status to the [[United States Olympic Committee]], and specifies requirements for its member national [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] for individual [[sport]]s.  

The current version of the Act was sponsored by [[Ted Stevens]], then–[[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Alaska]], and adopted in 1998.  It is a revision of the previous Amateur Sports Act of 1978 that reflects changes such as the fact that [[amateurism]] is no longer a requirement for competing in most international sports, expansion of the USOC's role to include the [[Paralympic Games]], increased athlete representation, and protection of the USOC against lawsuits involving athletes' right to participate in the [[Olympic Games]].

The United States Olympic Committee has used the law to force the "Gay Olympics" to change their name to the [[Gay Games]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"/&gt; The organization has threatened to use the law against the "Redneck Olympics," though it has given special dispensation to the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071387|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071616|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''welfare of animals in rodeo''' has been a topic of discussion for the industry, the public, and the law for decades.  Protests were first raised in the 1870s, and, in the middle twentieth century, laws were enacted to curb events using animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436"&gt;[[#Westermeier|Westermeier]]: 436&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) has worked with the rodeo industry (specifically, the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]) to establish rules improving [[animal welfare]] in rodeo and the treatment of rodeo animals.

Today, animal cruelty complaints in rodeo are still very much alive.  The PRCA (which governs about a third of the rodeos conducted in the United States annually) has provided rules for its members regarding [[animal welfare]].  However the concept of rodeo has changed from year to year, derving from the amount of people not in the event increasing. Some local rodeos have banned the use of certain rodeo tack including [[flank strap]]s and certain events such as [[steer tripping]].  Some ''[[charreada]]'' events staged in the United States saw a crack down in the early years of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
James Serpell stated in his ''In the Company of Animals'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps exaggerated to claim, as one author has, that the rodeo is 'the modern equivalent of the public hanging'. Nevertheless, these performances hinge on the violent subjugation of living animals, some of which are deliberately incited to frenzied violence by raking them with spurs, constricting the genital region with leather straps, or by thrusting an electric prod into the rectal area. At the same time they are often given bogus, malevolent names in order to deflect sympathy from their plight. Occasionally, they are maimed or killed, and many are forced to undergo the same terrifying ordeal several times a day. Yet the rodeo is presented to the American public as a harmless, red-blooded entertainment in which the cowboy – the epitome of wholesome, manly virtue – uses his courage and skill to overcome and subdue untamable, outlaw stock. Doubtless, the Romans employed similar fantasies to justify their activities in the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref name="Serpell: 225"&gt;[[#Serpell|Serpell]]: 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Protests were first raised regarding animal welfare in the 1870s, and, beginning in the 1930s, some states enacted laws curtailing rodeo activities and other events involving animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  In the 1950s, the then Rodeo Cowboys Association worked with the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) to establish regulations protecting the welfare of rodeo animals that were acceptable to both organizations. These regulations appear in the PRCA's annually-updated rule book. Rodeo saw its greatest growth in the 1970s and with it a rise in animal cruelty complaints.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  The PRCA and AHA have insinuated that these charges exist solely for the fund-raising purposes of other humane interest groups.  The protests and complaints have made the PRCA realize that public education regarding rodeo and the welfare of animals needs to be undertaken if rodeo is to survive.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;

In his "Author's Note" to ''Chasing the Rodeo'' (2005, 2006) author W.K. Stratton states, "Without question, rodeo exploits animals for the entertainment of humans, causing injury and death to hundreds of horses and cattle each year." Stratton notes that as many as a dozen head of steer and calves will die annually at a single large rodeo like the [[Calgary Stampede]], and that many valuable roping horses have died over the years at the [[Pendleton Roundup]] which is conducted on slippery grass. He also points out that while PETA ([[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) characterizes rodeo as "cruelty for a buck", conservative [[Matthew Scully]], a special assistant to and former speechwriter for President [[George W. Bush]] as well as author of ''[[Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy]]'' calls rodeo "gratuitous abuse of animals".  Stratton notes that he attended twenty plus rodeos and bullriding events in researching his book and saw "animals injured in the arena, some badly enough that they had to be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stratton|Stratton]]: 300&amp;ndash;302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent assessments==
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of [[animal cruelty]] by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122325/http://www.prorodeo.com/pdfs/AnimalWelfare.pdf ''Animal Welfare: The Care and Treatment of Professional Rodeo Livestock.'' PRCA {{dead link|date=May 2016}}] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians.  Reviewing  animal runs, the injury rate was documented 0.047% (16 animals in 33,991 runs.&lt;ref name="Sellnow2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=3233|author=Sellnow, L.|date=January 1, 2002|title=Rodeo horses|publisher=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0.053% (38 animal injuries in 71,743 animal exposures).&lt;ref name="Schonholtz2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=Schonholtz, C.|title=Professional rodeo horses are bred to buck |date=January 16, 2012|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/professional-rodeo-horses-are-bred-to-buck#sthash.4WAHrlNx.dpbs|accessdate=May 28, 2012|publisher=National Animal Interest Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0.056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26,584 performances).&lt;ref name="AVMA2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=AVMA|title=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|date=January 15, 2001|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of "slack" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured, i.e. 0.04%&lt;ref name="PRCApdf"/&gt;

In Australian rodeos, similar injury rates occur.  Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0.072% (one in 1,405), with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036% (one injury each 2,810 times an animal is used in competition).&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals in rodeo|publisher=Australian Professional Rodeo Association|author=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|accessdate=May 28, 2016|url=http://www.prorodeo.com.au/files/uploaded/file/animalwelfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist.   The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos, another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf/&gt; Several [[animal rights]] and animal welfare organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv SHARK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110002548/http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv |date=2011-11-10 }}''Animal Abuse Inherent in Rodeo''.

Groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) note incidents of animal injury, including an incident where a "bull [sic] suffered from a broken neck ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-in-Entertainment/rodeo-cruelty-for-a-buck.aspx ''Rodeo: Cruelty for a Buck'']. Retrieved 23 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), practice sessions are often the scene of more severe animal welfare abuses than competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo ASPCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123072049/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo |date=2008-11-23 }} "Animals in Entertainment: 5.4 Rodeo" 27 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto Medical Officer===
In 1990, when a major rodeo was planned for the [[Toronto]] [[Sky Dome]], [[Ontario, Canada]], the Toronto City Council requested the Toronto Medical Officer on Health to report on rodeo practices and whether "such practices could be deemed cruel to animals". The Medical Officer noted that animal handlers employed electric prods, flank straps, sharpened sticks, spurs and other tack were used to provoke animals into reacting in such a way as to make certain events thrilling for spectators, and thus it was unlikely to be enjoyable for livestock.&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"&gt;[[#Armstrong|Armstrong]]: 489&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medical Officer further noted that guidelines instituted to prevent animal abuse at sanctioned rodeos were paid little heed and calves suffered damage not readily visible such as bruised tracheal cartilage in roping events.  All bucking events were found by the Medical Officer to rely on the application of irritants to make the animals "fly" from the chutes.  The Medical Officer stated in his summary that in terms of a dictionary definition of cruelty, most rodeo events have the potential to cause injury, grief, or pain, and therefore can be considered cruel.  Although the Medical Officer did not say that the legal definition of cruelty had been met, he implied that it had been "reached, if not crossed."{{clarify|Is this a quote? If so, it is "stated, not implied"|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"/&gt;

===Veterinarians===
E.J. Finocchio, DVM wrote the Rhode Island legislature urging a ban on calf roping: "As a large animal veterinarian for 20 years ... I have witnessed first hand the instant death of calves after their spinal cords were severed from the abrupt stop at the end of a rope when traveling up to 30 mph. I have also witnessed and tended calves who became paralyzed ... and whose tracheas were totally or partially severed ... Slamming to the ground has caused rupture of several internal organs leading to a slow, agonizing death for some of these calves."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 152&lt;/ref&gt;

C.J. Haber, a veterinarian with 30 years experience as a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) meat inspector notes, "The rodeo folk send their animals to the packing house where ... I have seen cattle so extensively bruised that the only areas where the skin was attached [to the body] was the head, neck, legs, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and at times puncturing the lungs."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions of animal groups==
[[File:Calf Roping Rodeo.JPG|thumb|A steer after being roped.]]

===The Calgary Humane Society (CHS)===
"The Calgary Humane Society opposes the use of animals for any form of entertainment in which they are placed at risk of suffering undue stress, pain, injury or death."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|CHS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its position on animals in entertainment, CHS opposes rodeo events like chuckwagon racing, calf-roping and steer wrestling that are the most often implicated in injury to animals.

While other organizations may wish to intervene through protest, or other means, CHS has found it can best protect the interests of the animals involved by working with organizations that put on such events.  Over more than a decade of work with the Calgary Stampede, Calgary Humane Society has been instrumental in significant changes that have reduced injuries (for example, changes to the chuckwagon track that reduced stress fractures to the legs of horses; penalizing of calf-roping that yanked the calf backward) and eliminated certain high risk events (like wild cow milking).

CHS does its work by providing recommendations to the organizations, by following up on public complaints, and by having its Peace Officers attending these events to ensure the province's Animal Protection Act (APA) is upheld.

Under Alberta and Canadian law, Calgary Humane Society's primary role in attendance of the Calgary Stampede is to enforce the Animal Protection Act of Alberta.Calgary Humane Society Peace Officers attend every day of the Stampede to monitor and ensure the animals are being properly treated i.e., food, water, shelter and care. They are also immediately on scene of any accident involving an animal  to ensure the animal is being treated promptly, efficiently and humanely, to document what happened, and to follow up with the unresolved cases.

CHS encourages concerned citizens to document their complaints and send them to the agencies and individuals listed in the attached document.

===The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS)===
[[The Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) takes a position of opposition to all rodeos and rodeo events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The HSUS opposes rodeos as they are commonly organized, since they typically cause torment and stress to animals; expose them to pain, injury, or even death; and encourage an insensitivity to and acceptance of the inhumane treatment of animals in the name of sport. Accordingly, we oppose the use of devices such as electric prods, sharpened sticks, spurs, flank straps, and other rodeo equipment that cause animals to react violently, and we oppose bull riding, bronco riding, steer roping, calf roping, "wild horse racing," chuck wagon racing, steer tailing, and horse tripping.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|HSUS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Humane Society of the United States came into being in 1954 as an offshoot of the American Humane Association (AHA), and initially tackled legislation regarding humane slaughter, the protection of laboratory animals and other issues. In the 1970s, the organization began eyeing rodeo and its "psychologically damaging" effect on children.

===The Vancouver Humane Society===
"Vancouver Humane Society is opposed to rodeo because most rodeo events involve the use of fear, stress or pain to make animals perform."  In Canada, the City of Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have banned rodeos. For the most part, all animal welfare organizations in Canada oppose rodeo, including the Humane Society of Canada and the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.&lt;ref name="VHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo |title=Rodeo: animal abuse for the sake of entertainment |work=Vancouver Humane Society|accessdate=April 1, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318120749/http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=277&amp;Itemid=169 |title=Rodeos A Brutal Violent Spectacle Says The HSC |work=The Humane Society of Canada|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)===
PETA criticizes the United States military in its annual expenditure of tax dollars to support the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), stating that American tax dollars are fueling "horrific and cruel rodeo events".  PETA asserts that rodeo animals suffer fear and pain through the application of spurs, flank straps, prods, and tail-twisting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aguilar|Aguilar]]: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA has used some unorthodox methods to make its point. Moments after being crowned, [[Miss Rodeo America]] 2000 had a chocolate [[tofu]] 'cow pie' pushed in her face by a PETA member. PETA President, [[Ingrid Newkirk]], said in a statement that Miss Rodeo America should relinquish her crown for promoting cruelty to animals. "Now that she's got pie on her face, we hope Miss Rodeo America will find a little compassion in her heart," Newkirk said. The pageant is held in conjunction with the [[National Finals Rodeo]], an event PETA annually protests against, claiming the sport exploits animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Associated Press|AP]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)===
The [[ASPCA]] has a policy statement on rodeo events that reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ASPCA is opposed to all rodeo events that involve cruel, painful, stressful and potentially harmful treatment of livestock, not only in performance but also in handling, transport and prodding to perform. The ASPCA recognizes the cruel treatment inflicted on many additional animals in the process of practicing to compete in rodeo events. Further, the ASPCA is opposed to children's rodeo events such as goat tying, calf riding and sheep riding ("mutton busting"), which do not promote humane care and respect for animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ASPCA|ASPCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The American Humane Association (AHA)===
The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) used to campaign against rodeo through anti-rodeo literature but changed its strategy in the 1950s and began working with rodeo to establish rules to ensure the humane treatment of livestock.  The rules are updated as needed and published annually in the PRCA's rule book.  The AHA believes the exploitation of animals begins when "animals, people, and money" are mixed together, and what progress has been made is ascribed to a change in people's attitudes in general and the urban and college background of modern rodeo participants. Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has criticized the AHA for collaborating with rodeo and thereby lending respectability to its cruelties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fredricksson|Fredricksson]]: 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The AHA has strict requirements for the treatment and use of animals in movie rodeo scenes. The use of electric prods and other artificial stimuli to make an animal perform are forbidden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[#American Humane Association|AHA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (RSPCA Australia)===
The [[RSPCA Australia]] is opposed to rodeo. It has repeatedly called for rodeo to be banned,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_03_Rodeo%20Ban.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21424365-2862,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=RSPCA backs rodeo ban | first=Ian | last=Royall | date=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/01/08/48651_tasmania-news.html RSPCA moves on rodeos Tasmania News - The Mercury - The Voice of Tasmania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  and has funded media campaigns urging public boycott of prominent international rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_04_stamp_out_rodeos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its policy statement reads:

{{quote|RSPCA Australia is opposed to rodeos because of the potential for significant injury, suffering or distress to the animals involved. The use of devices such as flank straps, spurs and electric prods contributes to the pain and suffering associated with this sport.

Where rodeos are permitted to be conducted, RSPCA Australia advocates the adoption of compulsory registration and licensing. Compliance with national standards for the management, housing and transport of rodeo animals must be made a condition of licensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kb.rspca.org.au/RSPCA-Policy-C07-Rodeos_178.html RSPCA Policy C07 Rodeos], ''RSPCA Australia'', accessed February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==

===Rodeo===
The PRCA admits it only oversees about a third of the actual rodeos that occur in the United States annually, and, according to their own public relations information, the organization has taken steps to improve the welfare of animals. The organization says that most rodeo animals enjoy what they're doing.&lt;ref&gt;name="Serpell: 225"&lt;/ref&gt;  The PRCA's regulations and rules require, among other things, provisions for injured animals, [[veterinarian]]s on site at PRCA sanctioned rodeos, and [[spur]]s with dulled, free-spinning rowels.  Health regulations mandate vaccinations and blood testing of animals crossing state lines, and sick or injured animals are given appropriate veterinary care.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) in its Journal dated January 2001, Dr. James Furman, a former rodeo rider and mixed practice practitioner, stated at the organization's Animal Welfare Forum that ranchers provide their stock health and other care. When grilled about the possible damage to a calf's neck when he is roped and jerked to a sudden stop, Dr. Furman responded by observing that rodeo men have changed calf roping techniques; where they once roped and flipped a calf on its back they now try to spin the standing calf around.

''[[Charreada]]'' is amateur rodeo among Mexican Americans in the United States with family-owned arenas being operated for 200 teams in 12 states.  Eight states have cracked down on several traditional events including horse-tripping, an event in which the front legs of a running mare are roped causing her to fall, and steer tailing in which a steer is flipped to the earth by grabbing his tail. Some Mexican Americans have expressed concerns their culture is being unfairly targeted and point to the deaths of [[Eight Belles]] and other race horses as evidence that Anglo sports involving animals see few restrictions.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Rodeo sometimes appears in court. A PRCA [[stock contractor]] faced animal cruelty charges regarding the use of a prod at a California rodeo in 2002. Testimony revealed a rodeo judge and a veterinarian had been consulted before the rodeo about a chute-stalling horse, and an agreement had been reached that if the horse stalled, the prod would be applied to protect all involved. California law stipulates a prod cannot be used on an animal in a holding chute unless necessary to protect participants and spectators.  The stock contractor was cleared of charges because the chute gate was open when the prod was used, and therefore it was not a holding chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schonholtz|Schonholtz]]: Animal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
In response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns, a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo. In the United Kingdom the [[Protection of Animals Act 1934]] effectively made rodeo, as it was then practiced, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Garner Robert (1993) ''Animals, Politics and Morality'' Manchester, UK, Manchester University Press, p.88, {{ISBN|0-7190-3574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2000, California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringent regulations have virtually eliminated rodeo in [[Rhode Island]], a state which also stipulates that any individual convicted of animal cruelty in a rodeo cannot participate as a rodeo contestant.  While there is no record in any state of anyone being convicted of cruelty to animals during the course of a rodeo, several states&amp;mdash;[[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wyoming]]&amp;mdash;all exempt rodeo from its anticruelty laws, making such convictions impossible. Eleven of the states immunize rodeo events from the provisions of the law, while Utah excludes rodeo animals from the definition of 'animal' in its anitcruelty laws. [[Idaho]] has declared exhibitions that are commonly considered acceptable cannot be charged with cruelty to animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnett|Curnett]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

After a video aired on [[NBC]] showing a bull breaking its leg in a 1991 [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] rodeo, the city banned controversial rodeo tack, specifically electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]] 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go&amp;ndash;specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for teh Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] does not allow anyone to conduct a rodeo within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#PETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Woodstock, Illinois]] made fighting or wrestling with any animal illegal, thus ending [[steer wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 273&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ohio]] has restricted some rodeo practices, having outlawed unpadded flank and bucking straps and the use of electric prods on cattle and horses.    Rodeo was banned in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1934 when Parliament passed the Protection of Animals Act. [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]], and [[Pompano Beach, Florida]] have enacted legislation banning certain rodeo tack including [[bullwhip]]s.  [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] has banned rodeo within the city limits&amp;mdash;the only complete ban on rodeo in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jim Thorpe, 1912 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jim Thorpe]] at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]]]

An '''athlete''' (also '''sportsman'''  or '''sportswoman''') is a person who competes in one or more [[sport]]s that involve [[physical strength]], speed or [[endurance]]. The application of the term to those who participate in other activities, such as horse riding or driving, is somewhat controversial.

Athletes may be [[Professional sports|professional]]s or [[amateur sports|amateurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary, Millennium Ed. - 'athlete'&lt;/ref&gt; Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.

==Overview==
[[File:Armedforces crosscountry coppingerandballas.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes taking part in a race on a snowy park in the U.S.]]
The word "athlete" is a [[romanization]] of the {{lang-el|άθλητὴς}}, ''athlētēs'', one who participates in a contest; from ἄθλος, ''áthlos'', or ἄθλον, ''áthlon'', a contest or feat. The primary definition of "sportsman" according to Webster's ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'' (1960) is, "a person who is active in sports: as  (a): one who engages in the sports of the field and especially in hunting or fishing." Athletes involved in isotonic exercises have an increased mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume and are less likely to be depressed.&lt;ref&gt;MORGANROTH, JOEL, et al. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1024.7587&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Comparative left ventricular dimensions in trained athletes]." Annals of internal medicine 82.4 (1975): 521-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oler, Michael J., et al. "[http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7987512 Depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use among adolescents. Are athletes at less risk?]." Archives of Family Medicine 3.9 (1994): 781-785.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their strenuous physical activities, athletes are far more likely than the general population to visit [[massage]] salons and pay for services from massotherapists and masseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Jönhagen, Sven, et al. "[http://www.taichiqigongreikicentre.com.au/resources/Sports%20Massage%20after%20Eccentric%20Exercise.pdf Sports massage after eccentric exercise]." The American Journal of Sports Medicine 32.6 (2004): 1499-1503.&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes whose sport espouses endurance more than strength usually have a lower calorie intake than other athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Paul D., et al. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002604958490249X The effects of caloric restriction or exercise cessation on the serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of endurance athletes]." Metabolism 33.10 (1984): 943-950.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titles ==
{{see also|Athlete of the Year}}

==="All-around athlete"===
An "'''all-around athlete'''" is a person who competes in multiple sports at a high level. Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Lionel Conacher]], [[Deion Sanders]], [[Danny Ainge]], [[Babe Zaharias]] and [[Erin Phillips]]. Others include [[Ricky Williams]], [[Bo Jackson]], and [[Damon Allen]], each of whom was drafted both by [[Major League Baseball]] and by professional [[gridiron football]] leagues such as the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. Another female example is [[Heather Moyse]], a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in [[Bobsleigh|bobsled]] and member of the [[World Rugby Hall of Fame]] who also represented Canada internationally in [[track cycling]] and competed at [[U Sports|university]] level in basketball and track and field. Japanese athletes such as [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], [[Kazuyuki Fujita]], [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Naoya Ogawa]] have successfully performed in [[professional wrestling]] (which isn't a sport) and competed in [[mixed martial arts]].

==="World's Greatest Athlete"===
The title of "'''World's Greatest Athlete'''" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the [[decathlon]] (males) and [[heptathlon]] (females) in [[track and field]]. The [[decathlon]] consists of 10 events: [[100 meters]], [[long jump]], [[shot put]], [[high jump]], [[400 meters]], [[110 m hurdles]], [[discus]], [[pole vault]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[1500 m]]. The [[heptathlon]] consists of seven events: the [[100 m hurdles]], [[high jump]], [[shot put]], [[200 meters]], [[long jump]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[800 meters]]. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance.

Although the title "World's Greatest '''Athlete'''" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with [[Jim Thorpe]]. During the 1912 [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the [[Decathlon]] (among others). Thorpe notably also competed professionally in [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[American Football]], and [[basketball]]; and competed collegiately in [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[lacrosse]], and did [[ballroom dancing]]. King [[Gustav V of Sweden]], while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold said: "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world." That title has become associated with the decathlon event ever since.

A '''benefit''' is a match or season of activities granted by a sporting body to a loyal sportsman to boost their income before retirement. Often this is in the form of a match for which all the ticket proceeds are given to the player in question. However hosting one of these matches is a risk for the player in question as he/she is responsible for paying any relevant receipts and collects any excess income from the match, therefore income from such matches is more often than not reliant on attendance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/abs/10.1080/09523369908714056#.VS4qvpSUcmV|title = County cricketers’ benefits and testimonials, 1946–85,|last = Sadiford &amp; Vamplew|first = Keith A.P &amp; Wray|date = 1999|journal = The International Journal of the History of Sport|doi = 10.1080/09523369908714056|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the "beneficiary" can opt to give part or all of the money to charity. An example of this is [[Paul Collingwood]]'s 2007 benefit with [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. This may also occur when sportsmen unite for a cause, for example the [[Rafael Nadal]] vs [[Roger Federer]] "[[Match for Africa]]" (2010) where more than $2.6 million was raised for the [[Roger Federer Foundation]], enabling children living in poverty to realise their potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.match-for-africa.com/en/|title = Match for Africa 2|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rogerfedererfoundation.org/en/home/|title = Roger Federer Foundation|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/12/Other/Charity-Nadal-Federer-In-Madrid.aspx|title = Nadal, Federer Unite For Children In Madrid|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = ATP World Tour|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Benefit matches originated in English [[county cricket]] in a time period where playing sport, in particular cricket, for a living didn't offer as big of an income as it does in modern society (2015), holding a benefit at a player's 10 year service mark or retirement mark was considered a form of retirement/insurance policy. Benefit matches are confused with [[Testimonial match]]es, it's important to note that this is a direct gift from the club where income is guaranteed unlike in a benefit where income is often dependent on attendance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similar events were organised in Baseball in the 1860s, these events often occurred at season end involving the stars of the sport to acknowledge a significant member of the sport. However a rule established by the NABBP in 1859 prohibited any player compensation, the basis of this rule was to maintain fair game in competition and avoid professional vs. amateur situations arising.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early Professional Baseball and The Sporting Press|last = Furst|first = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25739">'''Boycotts of Israel in sports''' refer to various disqualifications and denial of Israeli athletes. As part of a more or less systematic [[boycott of Israel]], Israeli athletes and teams have been barred from some competitions. In many international competitions, where Israel does take part, such as the [[Olympic Games]], some [[Arab]] and Muslim competitors avoid competing against Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sports/Druze-Israeli-advances-as-Iraqi-foe-refuses-to-fight-564322|title=Druze-Israeli advances as Iraqi foe refuses to fight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{vague|date=September 2012}} countries even compel their athletes not to compete against Israelis or in Israel.

==Contemporary examples==
The [[Israel Football Association]] was a member of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) group of [[FIFA]] between 1954 and 1974. Because of the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]], several Arab and [[Muslim]] states refused to compete against Israel. The political situation culminated in Israel winning the [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification|1958 World Cup qualifying stage for Asia and Africa]] without playing a single game, forcing FIFA to schedule a playoff between Israel and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] to ensure the Israeli team did not qualify without playing at least one game (which Wales won). In 1974, Israel was expelled from the AFC group by a resolution initiated by Kuwait, which was adopted by AFC by a vote of 17 to 13 with 6 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aust-Asian bid fails |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RNRYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4321%2C5571494 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1974-09-16 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get around the ban, Israel was admitted as an associated member of the Union of European Football Associations ([[UEFA]]) in 1992, and was admitted as a full member of the UEFA group in 1994. Supporters of the [[Boycott Divestment Sanctions]] (BDS) movement have advocated for Israel to be expelled or suspended from FIFA, without success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/palestinians-disappointed-determined-after-fifa-betrayal |title=Palestinians disappointed but determined after FIFA betrayal |website=|language=en |date=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2018 the President of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub was fined CHF 20,000 (US$20,333) and banned from FIFA matches for a year for inciting hatred and violence against an Argentinian team proposing to play a friendly match in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Head-of-Palestinian-Football-fined-for-urging-fans-to-burn-photos-of-Messi-565722PALESTINIAN|title=FOOTBALL CHIEF BANNED BY FIFA FOR INCITING HATRED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Leonard Mucheru Maina|Mushir Salem Jawher]], a [[Kenya]]n-born [[marathon]]er, lost his [[Bahrain]]i citizenship after competing in the [[Tiberias Marathon]] in Israel, but later that year reacquired Bahraini citizenship and competed again in the Tiberias Marathon in 2008, 2009 and 2010.

In 2009, there was an increased number of full or partial boycotts of Israeli athletes, probably related to Arab/Leftist fury over [[Operation Cast Lead]]. Israeli tennis star [[Shahar Peer]] was denied a visa to participate in a tournament in [[Dubai]], leading to comments from stars like [[Serena Williams]] and [[Andy Roddick]] that were critical of the Dubai authorities' decision, with Roddick later pulling out of a tournament in Dubai. After a response that included a cable network cancelling its coverage of the event and a large fine for the Dubai Tennis Authorities, Dubai did issue a visa for Israeli tennis player [[Andy Ram]] to compete that year.

Tennis authorities in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]] wanted to cancel a [[Davis Cup]] match between Israel and Sweden because of [[2009 Malmö anti-Israel riots|anti-Israel riots]] and because the city council did not want the Israeli team competing in the city. The tennis authorities were unwilling to accept a Swedish forfeit, which would have eliminated Sweden from the competition, and decided to bar spectators from the match instead. As a punishment, the city was banned from hosting Davis Cup matches for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/daviscup/5095836/Sweden-punished-for-Israel-Davis-Cup-lockout.html|title=Sweden punished for Israel Davis Cup lockout|first=Telegraph staff and|last=agencies|date=2 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the BDS movement also tried and failed to have Israeli teams barred from the [[2012 London Olympics]] and the [[2016 Rio Olympics]]. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Egypt's [[Islam El Shehaby]] provoked outrage after refusing to shake hands with Israeli judoka, [[Or Sasson]].&lt;ref name=uaejudo/&gt;

Despite the country's international political issues, a growing{{vague|date=September 2012}} number of Arab athletes are joining domestic Israeli sports teams and the international teams, including the [[Israel national football team]]. These include [[Rifaat Turk]], [[Najwan Ghrayib]], [[Walid Badir]], [[Salim Toama]], [[Abbas Suan]], amongst others. Another [[Arab-Israeli]], Johar Abu Lashin, born in [[Nazareth]], was an [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] Welterweight champion.

In October 2017, when an Israeli won gold in an international judo championship in the United Arab Emirates, officials refused to fly the Israeli flag and play the Israeli national anthem, instead playing the official music of the International Judo Federation (IJF) and flying the IJF's logo.&lt;ref name=uaejudo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/27/sport/judo-abu-dhabi-grand-slam-tal-flicker-israel-national-anthem-flag/index.html|title=Israeli wins gold in UAE; officials refuse to play anthem|first=Henry Young,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE also banned Israeli athletes from wearing their country's symbols on uniforms,&lt;ref name=uaejudo/&gt; having to wear IJF uniforms. Other contestants received similar treatment. In December 2017, seven Israelis were denied visas by Saudi Arabia to compete in an international chess tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42484987|title=Storm brews over Saudi chess tournament|journal=BBC News|date=26 December 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the UAE reversed its position allowing the Israeli flag be displayed and anthem played when an Israeli judoka won a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-Judoka-Sagi-Muki-wins-gold-medal-in-Abu-Dhabi-570533 HATIKVAH PLAYS FOR FIRST TIME IN UAE AS ISRAELI JUDOKA WINS GOLD]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2018, a team of international jurists, including Harvard Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], announced a plan to petition the international [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] against the exclusion of Israel’s flag and anthem at sporting events in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Petition-filed-to-force-Arab-states-to-show-Israeli-flag-at-sports-events-558284|title=Dershowitz to sue against Israeli flag ban at sports events in Arab state|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the International Judo Federation cancelled two grand slam judo events, in [[Tunis]] and [[Abu Dhabi]], because Israeli flags were not allowed to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Regev-gets-Israeli-flag-less-Tunis-Abu-Dhabi-judo-events-cancelled-563034|title=Regev gets Israeli flag-less Tunis, Abu Dhabi judo events cancelled|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in July 2018, the [[World Chess Federation]] said it will ban Tunisia from hosting the international chess competition in 2019 if it does not grant a visa to Israeli contestants, including a seven-year-old Israeli girl champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Tunisia-could-lose-chance-to-host-World-Chess-meet-after-banning-Israelis-563689|title=Tunisia could lose chance to host World Chess meet after banning Israelis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual sporting boycott==
Since the 21st century, Israeli athletes competing in tournaments have faced boycotts by athletes from Muslim countries (primarily [[Iran]]), speculated to be the result of political interferences.

'''Chinese Wand''' Exercise is an obscure ancient [[exercise]] system, related to the martial art [[Kung Fu]].  The “wand” in Chinese Wand Exercise is a 48-50” long dowel, 1” in diameter, (wood or [[bamboo]], for example), used as a [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] for balance, form and posture. “It’s the [[pyramid effect]], with you as center.”&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"&gt;Lanie Frame “Chinese Wand Exercises ‘Key to Perfect Health’” (March 1978) Daily Herald-News&lt;/ref&gt;	“Seventeen gentle bending, twisting and lunging  movements flow in exact order, specially designed to get the blood circulating more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Nelda Clemmons “Chinese wand exercises a little magic” (December  1977) The Tampa Times&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises are done in gradual, easy ‘Stages’ while using an original Chinese deep-breathing technique” and [[chi energy]], and can be easy or more challenging as the individual chooses.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"&gt;Chinese Wand Exercise by Bruce L. Johnson. William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they exercise every major muscle in the body and take no more than 20 minutes to complete. The relative ease of the 17 moves (11 standing and six floor exercises) engage all the organs and muscles of the body together in harmony rather than separating out one part of the body from another. This produces a more efficient way of staying fit and healthy by increasing and balancing the chi energy.

“Chinese Wand prevents illness and delays the aging process of many cells.”&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Mike, “Chinese Wand Exercises: Integrating Body, Mind and Spirit,” San Fernando Valley Magazine, June 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they exercise the entire body safely and gently. Chinese Wand was known as a “preventive” of disease while [[acupuncture]] was the “treatment.”

==History in China==

Although awareness of its existence is recent, Chinese Wand is said to be thousands of years old.&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"/&gt; It was passed down through Grand Masters and kept private for the use of the succeeding Chinese rulers and their families. They were devised for the emperor to slow down the aging process and maintain perfect health.&lt;ref name="Mary Jane Hunter"&gt;Mary Jane Hunter, “Exercises for young and old.” March 1978, News-Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercises were derived from studying animals at play in [[nature]], hence some of the names of the forms: “Springing of the Tiger,” “Raising of the Bird’s Wing,” “Panda Rolls,” to name a few.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt; Chinese wand is not by itself taught as a method of self-defense.

It should be noted that the source of all current information stems from Bruce L. Johnson, who is currently the only known living Grand Master of Chinese Wand.

==Coming To America==

According to Johnson, when he was 19 he learned the exercises from 93-year-old Grand Master Ch’eng in 1945. He and two [[United States Navy|Navy]] buddies, all wrestlers, were exploring [[Shanghai]] and were amazed by an 80-year-old rickshaw man’s ability to pull a wide [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] with the three muscular seamen up and down the steep hills of Shanghai. Johnson pursued the slight Chinese man who eventually led him to the slender, regal Grand Master. Upon meeting Dr. Ch’eng at his home in Shanghai, the tall, 235-pound 19-year-old was unable to take down the 130&amp;nbsp;lb.  Ch’eng who, seemingly inexplicably, fended him off and left him lying on the floor after each of three increasingly aggressive advances. He used an ancient “spinning” technique. Johnson, convinced that he had to learn everything this man could teach, was soon accepted as a student by Ch’eng, who was no doubt impressed and amused by the young headstrong man’s potential and enthusiasm for learning all he could.  Eventually Dr. Ch’eng, having lost his sons in the war between China and Japan, trusted Johnson enough to pass on the knowledge and techniques he would need to become the next Grand Master.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt;

==Biography of Grand Master Bruce L. Johnson==

[[Minnesota]]-raised Bruce Leroy Johnson, (June 21, 1926- December 11, 2014) was a sickly child who overcame his early beginnings through exercise and [[body-building]].  Health and [[physical fitness]] became a lifelong passion, as well as a quest to stay young and embrace Nature.

After high school, during [[World War II]],  the handsome blue-eyed, black-haired (of Swedish and Iroquois descent) Johnson became a [[Navy]] heavyweight wrestling champion&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Hiebert, “Afton Adonis is Married to the Oceans”, Oliver Towne&lt;/ref&gt; who excelled in physical exploits and competitions.  He also was a [[navy ranger]], and one of the first to reach the shores of [[Iwo Jima]]. His mother’s sister was married to revered World War II [[journalist]] and author, [[Ernie Pyle]], with whom Bruce had a close relationship and who was killed only a few miles from where Johnson was, on the island of [[Ie Shima]].&lt;ref&gt;Palm Beach Post-Times, April 19, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He is often called upon to accept memorial awards on behalf of his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;“Pyle’s Death is Recalled,” Honolulu Adviser, April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"&gt;Joe Rafferty,  “’Bamboozle’ Weighty Problems with the Ancient Chinese Wand Exercises,” Norwich Bulletin, October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson studied at the [[Kodokan Institute]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] where he earned three [[black belts]] in [[Judo]].&lt;ref&gt;Alison Wyrley Birch, “The Magic in a Wand of Bamboo.” November 1975, The Sunday Republican&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in the states after World War II, Johnson tried to introduce the merits of the exercise [[system]]. But because of [[McCarthyism]] and the fear of [[Communism]], there was little enthusiasm about anything Asian. Few showed interest in learning the unusual, oriental exercises.

Meanwhile, wanderlust led Johnson around the world finding work, often on ships. He was a [[bodyguard]] for [[King Farouk]] for a time. Wherever he went in the world, he sought out others who might have heard of Chinese Wand, even placing ads in local papers. But he never found anyone. As far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it.  Johnson spent time in [[Hollywood]] and found a small group of [[health food]] and fitness enthusiasts such as [[Mae West]], [[Jimmy Durante]], and others who became students.&lt;ref&gt;Nelda Clemmons, “Chinese wand exercises a little magic,” December 1977, The Tampa Times&lt;/ref&gt; It has been rumored that he might have been the inspiration for the song “[[Nature Boy]]” (popularized by [[Nat King Cole]]) when he claimed he spent time with the songwriter, [[Eden Ahbez]]. Later, he taught celebrities such as [[James Coburn]] who was photographed in [[People Magazine]] doing the exercises.&lt;ref&gt;“Over the Tube”, People Magazine, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson became friends with [[Bruce Lee]], and the two did demonstrations of strength and speed together. “Bruce [Lee] was the only man who could ever ‘handle’ me - of course, he never knew Dr. Cheng.”&lt;ref name="Karen Kaye"&gt;Karen Kaye, “Bruce Johnson and his Amazing Chinese Wand”  Los Angeles Free Press, October 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was quoted in Johnson’s book as saying, “All things are possible with the great Masters.”&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"/&gt;

In 1965, Johnson became a hero when he rescued three children from a shark in the [[Bahamas]] by swimming out and averting its attention . A fourth child was killed. Armed with only a pointed shell he grabbed on the beach, he fought the beast a full five minutes underwater, his leg in its mouth until he jabbed its eye with the shell and was able to escape, barely making it to shore.&lt;ref name="The Secret Strength"&gt;”The Secret Strength of Bruce Johnson”, Palm Beach Post-Times,
February 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He won international acclaim and was honored by heads of three governments.&lt;ref&gt;The Tribune, October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

He caused another sensation in 1966 when he and a friend (who later became his wife) volunteered to spend an unspecified amount of time on an uninhabited [[Fiji|Fiji Island]] with no supplies, only bathing suits and camera equipment. Learning too late that the island was far from idyllic limited their stay to 40 days, but caused national publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Webster K. Nolan, “Island Paradise Lost… to Hunger and Rats”, UPI, January 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramatic adventures seemed to follow the elusive Johnson who often found himself at the right place in time to rescue others from extreme danger (over 50 documented at the risk of his own life) including fires, mangled cars, even abusive husbands.

Johnson rarely spoke of his powers as a [[mysticism|mystic]]. Students would sometimes notice [[supernatural]] transformations in his appearance as he taught the class.  He was inclined to believe that Dr. Ch’eng was teaching through him. One famous [[psychic]] of his day, [[Peter Hurkos]], upon meeting Johnson said, “Who is that beautiful Chinese man coming out of you?”&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"/&gt;

Others saw Johnson transform: after a class in [[Eureka, California]], a young student “asked him if he knew that he had become transformed into a Chinese person while he was performing the wand exercises. . .Did you see it too?...” another classmate added.&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"/&gt;

It has also been said that the late Dr. Ch'eng's formidable, otherworldly presence was physically tangible, gentle, even erotic.

Enthusiasm for Chinese Wand was minimal until a nationwide curiosity in [[Eastern philosophy]] erupted in the 1960s, beginning with the [[Beatles]]’ trip to [[India]] and the subsequent publicity. Interest in meditation techniques, [[yoga]], martial arts, and other esoteric practices spiked.  At last, Johnson was able to develop classes. Eventually, he self-published a book in 1975.

In December 1976, Johnson, who also worked as a professional diver, was seriously injured in an underwater accident and sustained a near-fatal brain stem infarct causing [[Stroke symptoms|stroke-like symptoms]].&lt;ref name="Mary Jane Hunter"/&gt; Initially told he would never walk again, he once again defied odds and within a matter of months,  was walking and looking as healthy as ever.&lt;ref name="Karen Kaye"/&gt;

Although still reeling from lingering and painful after-effects of the trauma, he managed to generate interest from a major publisher ([[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]], [[New York City|New York]]) who published his book in hardcover in 1977.

During the time he was striving to regain his health, he underwent a  [[Christian]] “[[born-again]]” experience that eventually influenced his thinking and upended his belief system. He slowly rejected a [[holistic]] awareness of consciousness and abandoned his lifelong allegiance to preserving and re-introducing the teachings of Dr. Ch’eng and the art of Chinese Wand.  The spreading of a popular desire to learn the more violent aspects of martial arts and the potential “danger” of involvement with the [[supernatural]] conflicted with his newfound [[ultra-conservative]] Christian views. Efforts to promote Chinese Wand diminished and eventually disappeared from public view.

“--Oriental philosophy is at their [martial arts] heart,” Johnson says. “These things are not from [[God]], as God is not in the business of [[mystical]] energies or the [[occult]]. . .I no longer practice the martial arts …as a Christian, I cannot in good conscience, teach or recommend the martial arts to others.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs by John Ankerberg &amp; John Weldon c. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese Wand Today==

Even though Johnson’s book is no longer in print, the web and [[YouTube]] videos are generating a resurgence of the practice in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. A new generation of students are learning what they can from Johnson’s book, sometimes by changing the name slightly (e.g. `Chi Stix', 'Stick Yoga,' or `[[Jian Gan]] - Chinese Health Wand') to avoid copyright infringement on Johnson's original text.

Sadly, it appears that Johnson did not train anyone to carry on this unique art as the next Grand Master. Because of this, apart from the basic exercises, the remaining 190 exercises, more esoteric practices and knowledge, are probably lost.

	“I am the last of the Grand Masters [of Chinese Wand]. When I go, the secret goes with me.”&lt;ref name="The Secret Strength"/&gt;

==The Future==

Although Johnson is the last Grand Master his book opened the art up to the wider population. He wanted his book to be in every nursing home, every hospital, every physical therapy room, every doctor's office for the doctor to prescribe the exercises to patients - in every home so families could practice together; he also hoped that workers in offices and factories could practice the exercises together to increase productivity and health of workforce and that physical fitness instructors in schools and colleges would adopt the system.
&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt;

Some in the Chinese martial arts and Qigong community are now taking a serious interest in the Chinese Wand and promoting its use as a social exercise the way Johnson envisaged. A new book on the subject examines the esoteric aspects of the art and its origins and influences - and encourages dialogue within China itself.&lt;ref name="Michael Davies"&gt;Jiangan - Chinese Health Wand by Michael Davies, Singing Dragon, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The link with China was very much in Johnson's thoughts. He was curious whether someone was still practicing in a remote region of China &lt;ref name="The Day"&gt;The Day, New London Connecticut, September 9, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to take the art back to China himself:-

"In China they now do Tai Chi, but my one ambition is to return there and bring their ancient Chinese exercises full circle." &lt;ref name="Victoria Advocate"&gt;The Victoria Advocate, April 4, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">The '''Chris Brasher Sporting Life Trophy''' is a trophy that is awarded annually to the elite male and female winners of the [[London Marathon]]. It was previously awarded to the winners of the [[Polytechnic Marathon]] between 1909 and 1961 which was staged between Windsor in Berkshire and various locations in London.

The creation of the trophy was instigated by Jack Andrew, the secretary of the [[Kingston Athletic Club and Polytechnic Harriers|London 
Polytechnic Harriers]] athletics club in the wake of the popularity of the marathon after the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London. Andrew approached William Will, the editor of the ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'', who agreed to fund a trophy for a new annual marathon race in London.&lt;ref name="Lambie2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Lambie|title=The Story of Your Life: A History of the Sporting Life Newspaper (1859-1998)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJcbd-7pYlkC|year=2010|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-84876-291-6|page=276-281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy was made by London's [[Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Company]] and cost £500. It was funded by Eleanor, the widow of William McFarlane, the former owner of ''Sporting Life''.&lt;ref name="Lambie2010"/&gt;

The trophy is 4&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit)|ft]] 6in high.&lt;ref name="Lambie2010"/&gt; The ''Sporting Life'' withdrew the trophy from the Polytechnic Marathon in 1962 after several years of failing finances for the race. The ''Sporting Life'' was then owned by [[Trinity Mirror|Mirror Group Newspapers]] who declined to fund the event any further. The marathon was subsequently sponsored by [[Callard &amp; Bowser-Suchard|Callard &amp; Bowser]], who made a [[butterscotch]] energy food.&lt;ref name="Lambie2010"/&gt; The trophy was subsequently stored at the headquarters of the ''Sporting Life'' for several years until 1969 when it was presented to the Polytechnic Harriers in perpetuity with the proviso that the club "the best means and method that will fulfill the original purpose of the trophy"; the original purpose being to "encourage long distance running in Great Britain".&lt;ref name="Lambie2010"/&gt;

It was renamed in honour of [[Chris Brasher]] shortly before the [[2003 London Marathon]].&lt;ref name=BBCApr03&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/london_marathon_2003/2910897.stm|title=Runners to Honour Brasher|date=9 April 2003|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">A '''comparison of [[baseball]] and [[softball]]''' can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

[[Fastpitch softball]] is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational [[sports league|league]]s where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).

      <comment>Added detail to intro in regard to deeper breathing pattern increasing IAP</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10023">'''Core stability''' refers to a person's ability to stabilize their [[Core (anatomy)|core]]. Stability, in this context, should be considered as an ability to control the position and movement of the core. Thus, if a person has greater core stability, they have a greater level of control over the position and movement of this area of their body. The body's core is frequently involved in aiding other movements of the body, such as the limbs, and it is considered that by improving core stability a person's ability to perform these other movements may also be improved i.e. core stability training may help improve someone's running ability. The body's core region is sometimes referred to as the [[torso]] or the trunk, although there are some differences in the muscles identified as constituting them. The major muscles involved in core stability include the [[pelvic floor]] muscles, [[transversus abdominis]], [[multifidus]], [[internal obliques|internal]] and [[external obliques]], [[rectus abdominis]], [[erector spinae]] (sacrospinalis) especially the [[longissimus thoracis]], and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The minor muscles involved include the [[latissimus dorsi]], [[gluteus maximus]], and [[trapezius]]. Notably, breathing, including the action of the diaphragm, can significantly influence the posture and movement of the core; this is especially apparent in regard to extreme ranges of inhalation and exhalation. On this basis, how a person is breathing may influence their ability to control their core. 

Some researchers have argued that the generation of intra-abdominal pressure, caused by the activation of the core muscles and especially the transversus abdominis, may serve to lend support to the [[lumbar spine]].&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Hodges, A.E.M. Eriksson, D. Shirley, S.C. Gandevia. 'Lumbar Spine Stiffness is Increased by Intra-Abdominal Pressure' &lt;https://isbweb.org/images/conf/2001/Longabstracts/PDF/0300_0399/0314.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One way in which intra-abdominal pressure can be increased is by the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern. In this case, and as considered by Hans Lindgren, 'The diaphragm [...] performs its breathing function at a lower position to facilitate a higher IAP.'&lt;ref&gt;http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern may improve core stability.

Typically, the core is associated with the body's center of gravity, which is over the region of the second sacral vertebrae groups and stability is associated with isometric or static strength. In addition, it is the lumbar spine that is primarily responsible for posture and stability thus providing the strength needed for the stability especially utilized in dynamic sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Running |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; 1st edition|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8092-9899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Whenever a person moves, to lift something or simply to move from one position to another, the core region is tensed first{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. This [[Muscle tone|tension]] is usually made unconsciously and in conjunction with a change in breathing pattern{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. An example to try is to sit in a chair and to reach forward over a table to pick up a cup. This movement is first accompanied by a tension in the core region of the abdomen and can be felt by placing one hand on the abdomen as the movement is made{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

As the load increases the key muscles contract around the viscera, which are in-compressible, to form a stable ball-like core region against which the forces are balanced in coordination with posture.

It is commonly believed that core stability is essential for the maintenance of an upright [[Neutral spine|posture]] and especially for movements and lifts that require extra effort such as lifting a heavy weight from the ground to a table{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Without core stability the lower back is not supported from inside and can be injured by strain caused by the exercise{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  It is also believed{{By whom?|date=March 2017}} that insufficient core stability can result in lower back pain and lower limb injuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

There is little support in research for the core stability model and many of the benefits attributed to this method of exercise have not been demonstrated. At best core stability training has the same benefits as general, non-specific exercise&lt;ref&gt;Kriese M, et al Segmental stabilization in low back pain: a systematic review. Sportverletz Sportschaden. 2010 Mar;24(1):17-25. Epub 2010 Mar 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rackwitz B, et al Segmental stabilizing exercises and low back pain. What is the evidence?

==Training methods==
Training methods for developing and maintaining core stability include:
* [[Pilates]]
* [[Exercise ball]], also known as a Swiss ball, stability ball, [[yoga]] ball, [[Pilates]] ball or fitness ball
* [[Yoga]]

==Exercise for strengthening of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine==
The [[cervix|cervical]], [[thoracic]] and [[lumbar]] spine is composed of a total of 24 [[presacral]] [[vertebrae]] and their main functions are to protect the spinal cord, provide an attachment site for many muscles of the body. They also function by distributing one's bodyweight when standing upright.&lt;ref&gt;"Vertebral column". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2015. Web. 16 Feb. 2015 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626589/vertebral-column&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many injuries to the spine occur as a result of [[single-vehicle accident|vehicle accidents]], [[falling (accident)|falling]], and [[sports]] and [[recreation]]. While it is impossible to prevent such events from happening, increasing intra-abdominal pressure and strengthening the musculature in the back, along with keeping a neutral spine, can minimize injuries like [[hernia]]s, [[strain (injury)|strain]]s, and [[sprains]].

===Intra-abdominal pressure===
The correlation between having a significant amount of core strength and spinal health has been well documented by many studies in the past. Some of these studies were able to quantify the effects that antagonizing abdominal muscle had on stabilizing the lumbar spine by increasing the amount of intra-abdominal pressure in order to maintain a straight lumbar spine and to avoid rounding during physical activities &lt;ref&gt;Gardner-Morse, M., &amp; Stokes, I. (1998). The Effects of Abdominal Muscle Coactivation on Lumbar Spine Stability. Spine, 23(1), 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt; and using simple techniques such as the “Valsalva maneuver”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldish, MD, G., Quast, MD, J., Blow, MD, J., &amp; Kuskowski, PhD, M. (1994). Postural Effects on Intra-Abdominal Pressure During Valsalva Maneuver. Arch Phys Mad Rehabil ,, Vol75, 324-327.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple exercise used to strengthen the abdominals (rectus abdominis, internal/external obliques, and transverse abdominis) is using the isometric or “static” hold known as [[Plank (exercise)|the plank]].

===Strengthening back musculature===
Simply by working to keep a neutral spine and remembering to increase intra-abdominal pressure before performing a movement that could compromise the spine, you are able to drastically decrease your risk for sustaining a back injury. If you were looking for ways to both strengthen and increase stability of the musculature of the spine one could perform various body weight exercises, for instance the [[Bird dog (exercise)|bird dog exercise]].

'''Cricket diplomacy''' consists of using the game of [[cricket]] as a political tool to enhance or worsen the diplomatic relations between two [[List of International Cricket Council members|cricket playing nations]]. Cricket is the second-most widely played game in the world after [[association football|football]], and is thus used as a political tool to bridge the gap in the diplomatic vacuum.

==Australia and England==
{{main|The Ashes}}
The [[Bodyline]] controversy was detrimental to relations between England and Australia. The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the MCC—supported by the British public and still of the opinion that their ''fast leg theory'' tactic was harmless—took serious offence at being branded "unsportsmanlike" and demanded a retraction. Many people saw bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 241&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine, and by extension the entire English team, threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour.&lt;ref name="p259"&gt;Pollard, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The Governor of South Australia, [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] [[James Henry Thomas]] that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 242&amp;ndash;248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p2601"/&gt; The standoff was settled only when Australian prime minister [[Joseph Lyons]] met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.&lt;ref name="p2601"&gt;Pollard, pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 255&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country displayed a preference for not buying goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the ''North China Daily News'' published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] were lost by Australians because of local reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934–35 a statue of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word "BODYLINE" painted on it.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and Pakistan==
{{Main|India–Pakistan cricket rivalry}}
Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur - a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, in 2004 after a break of fifteen years, India toured Pakistan in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. In 1991, the workers of the [[List of political parties in India|Indian political party]] [[Shiv Sena]] dug up the cricket pitch at the [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai]] on the eve of an India-Pakistan [[Test cricket|Test match]] which was to be held there, forcing the entire series between the two nations to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1602/16020280.htm|title=Navigation News - Frontline|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20121101/main4.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Main News|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shiv Sena once again used this unique means of protest at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[New Delhi]] in 2000 to protest against the Pakistan cricket team's proposed visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=21 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.

During the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]], [[2011 Cricket World Cup Semifinal: India v Pakistan|the semifinal]] is believed to have eased the relationship between India and Pakistan after the polarising 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]] used this opportunity and greeted his Pakistani counterpart [[Yousuf Raza Gilani]] to watch the match with him at Mohali. Gilani subsequently accepted the offer and agreed to watch the match with Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Video/133811/44/india-vs-pakistan-pakistan-prime-minister-yousuf-raja-gilani-arrives-in-chandigarh.html|title=- Video - Pak PM Gilani arrives in Chandigarh - Sports Videos - - India Today|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Video/133816/44/india-vs-pakistan-india-to-play-semi-final-match-against-pakistan-in-mohali.html|title=- Video - 'Cricket brings India Pak together' - Sports Videos - - India Today|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has requested Indian govt. to allocate a cricket stadium for Afghanistan Cricket team in India. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theindiantalks.com/featured/modi-should-engage-in-cricket-diplomacy-with-afghanistan/4697/ | work=The Indian Talks | title=Modi Should Engage in Cricket Diplomacy with Afghanistan | date=25 April 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150425213015/http://www.theindiantalks.com/featured/modi-should-engage-in-cricket-diplomacy-with-afghanistan/4697/ | archivedate=25 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Zimbabwe==
In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England, and the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] subsequently suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking them to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=21 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China and Taiwan==
Extending a form of [[cultural diplomacy]] popularly called [[stadium diplomacy]], China has also joined cricket diplomacy. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] also built both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket globally. The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Double Full''' is a [[trampoline]] move that comprises a single (normally straight) back [[somersault]] with two full twists. This move also may be executed on the ground in rapid succession as part of a cheerleading/gymnastics/acrobatics routine.

Compared to a full back (full twisting back somersault), a double full is a more advanced move. It's not often seen in high-grade routines because it has only 360° of somersault rotation.

The performer sharply and tightly brings the arms down to the sides and maintains a straight body position to speed up the rotation generated from a full back. Variations of this twist-acceleration process include folding the arms one above the other across the midsection or crossing the arms to form an "X" shape across the chest.  The latter is becoming less common due to debate over its safety.

Double fulls are usually performed in the straight position, though they may be performed in both tucked and piked shapes. The straight shape is most common, however, since it helps to slow the somersault rotation down. As somersault rotation is sped up greatly with the addition of twist, keeping rotation low is important, especially as there is a great deal of twist rotation involved in the move.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90864">{{short description| Watertight clothing that seals the wearer from cold and hazardous liquids }}
[[File:US Navy 060329-F-3759D-001 U.S. Navy divers assigned to the rescue and salvage ship USS Safeguard (ARS 50) prepare to dive.jpg|upright=2|thumb|U.S. Navy divers in dry suits prepare to dive]]

A '''dry suit''' or '''drysuit''' provides the wearer with environmental protection by way of [[thermal insulation]] and exclusion of water,&lt;ref name="Piantadosi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nishi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thalmann" /&gt; and is worn by [[underwater diving|divers]], [[boating|boaters]], [[List of water sports|water sports enthusiasts]], and others who work or play in or near cold or contaminated water. A dry suit normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and possibly the feet. In hazmat configurations, however, all of these are covered as well.&lt;ref name="High risk"/&gt;

The main difference between dry suits and [[wetsuit]]s is that dry suits are designed to prevent water entering. This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. Dry suits can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. For divers, they add some degree of operational complexity as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to minimize "squeeze" on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to excessive buoyancy.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;

Dry suits provide passive thermal protection: They insulate against heat transfer to the environment.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt; When this is insufficient, active warming or cooling may be provided, usually by a hot-water suit, which is a wetsuit with a supply of heated or chilled water from the surface, but it is also possible to provide chemical or electrically powered heating accessories to dry suits.

==Components==

===Essential components===
The essential components include a shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where parts of the body pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while the suit is worn. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually largely provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on trapped air for its insulating properties. An inflation valve with gas supply and dump valve are generally provided, but were not standard on early models.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

====Shell====
The main part of the dry suit is a waterproof shell made from a membrane type material, foamed [[neoprene]] or a hybrid of both.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;

=====Membrane=====
[[File:Viking pro 1000 drysuit with magnum hood.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Rubber on two way stretch knit fabric has an external surface that is relatively easy to decontaminate&lt;ref name="Viking" /&gt;]][[File:Plongee CombinaisonsEtanchesDansLaGlace-199912.jpg|thumb|right|Membrane drysuit in icy water]]
Membrane dry suits are made from thin materials which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of [[stockinette]] fabric coated with [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], laminated layers of [[nylon]] and [[butyl rubber]] known as [[Trilaminate]] or [[Cordura]] proofed with an inner layer of [[polyurethane]]. With the exception of the rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly oversized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] to move or keep joints flexed.

To stay warm in a membrane suit, the wearer must wear an insulating undersuit, today typically made with [[polyester]] or other synthetic fiber [[Batting (material)|batting]]. Polyester and other synthetics are preferred over natural materials, since synthetic materials have better insulating properties when damp or wet from [[Perspiration|sweat]], seepage, or a leak.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;{{rp|73}}

Reasonable care must be taken not to puncture or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;{{rp|73}}

Membrane dry suits may also be made of a waterproof but breathable material like [[Gore-Tex]] to enable comfortable wear without excessive humidity and buildup of condensation. This function does not work underwater. [[Sailor]]s and boaters who intend to stay out of the water may prefer this type of suit.&lt;ref name=Kokatat /&gt;

=====Neoprene=====
[[Image:Diving suit neoprene.jpg|thumb|The neck seal, the zip, the inflator, a wrist seal, and the manual cuff vent of a [[neoprene]] dry suit]]

[[Neoprene]] is a type of [[synthetic rubber]] which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called "foamed neoprene", "foam-neoprene" or "expanded neoprene". Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is skinned with a layer of knit fabric bonded to each side for strength and abrasion resistance. Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing some insulation due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles, like a wet suit, which is proportional to the thickness of the foam, Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|55}}

Neoprene dry suits are generally not as easy to put on and remove as are membrane dry suits, largely due to a closer fit which is possible due to the inherent elasticity of the material, and partly due to greater weight. As with wet suits, their buoyancy and thermal protection decreases with depth as the air bubbles in the neoprene are compressed. The air or other gas in the dry fabric undergarments providing insulation under a dry suit is also compressed, but can be restored to an effective volume by inflating the drysuit at depth through an inflator valve, thus preventing "suit squeeze" and compacting of the air-filled undersuit. Foam-neoprene tends to shrink over the years as it loses gas from the foam and slowly becomes less flexible as it ages.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|56}}
An alternative is crushed or compressed foam neoprene, which is less susceptible to volume changes when under pressure. Crushed neoprene is foam neoprene which has been hydrostatically compressed so much that the gas bubbles have been mostly eliminated, this retains the elasticity of foamed neoprene which allows freedom of movement, but does not provide much insulation, and is functionally more like a membrane suit.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

=====Hybrid=====
Some suits marketed as hybrid suits combine the features of both types, with a membrane top attached to a neoprene bottom near the waist.&lt;ref name="DUI 50/50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The neoprene part is usually configured as a sleeveless "farmer-john" that covers the torso as well. This style is often used for surface water sports, especially in very cold water. The tight fitting lower part lets the wearer kick while swimming, and the loose fitting top allows easy arm movement. The torso covering also provides additional self-rescue or survival time if the suit leaks.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Other manufacturers such as "Waterproof", use the term to refer to a membrane suit with integral liner of a relatively compression resistant porous 3-dimensional mesh, which creates a thin but resilient air space between the suit shell and the diver.&lt;ref name="Leisurepro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterproof D1 Hybrid" /&gt;

====Seals====
[[File:Silicone neck seal with clamping ring - inside P8170011.jpg|thumb|left|Silicone neck seal attached with clamping ring - view inside the suit]]
[[File:Silocone cuff seals with clip-on clamping rings P8110005.jpg|thumb|Silicone dry suit cuff seals with clip-on clamping rings: above - assembled, below - components]]
Seals at the wrists and neck prevent water entering the suit by a close contact fit against the skin around the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to [[Perspiration|sweat]] and [[condensation]]. The seals are typically made from [[latex]] [[rubber]] or foam [[neoprene]],&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; but are also available in silicone rubber.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, [[oxygen]], and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an [[Latex allergy|allergic]] reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter because they do not seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.

A recent innovation is the [[silicone]] seal, which is claimed to be as supple as latex, more flexible, yet far more durable. These are now available as original equipment on some makes of dry suit. Silicone seals are hypoallergenic, but can not be glued to the suit, and must be attached using clip-on rings. The silicone seals are similar in mechanical strength to latex seals but do not deteriorate as rapidly from oxidation and chemical attack. They are initially relatively expensive, but can be replaced without tools by the user which reduces cost of replacement.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterproof" /&gt;

====Waterproof entry====
[[Image:Dry suit shoulder-entry.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder (rear entry) zipper]]
[[File:Plastic watertight drysuit zipper tooth and seal edge detail P8110020.jpg|thumb|Plastic watertight dry suit zipper: tooth and seal edge detail - the watertight seal is made by pressing together the continuous ridge along the middle of the teeth when the zipper is closed.]]
[[Image:Dry suit front-entry.jpg|thumb|left|Front entry zipper]]
[[File:Plastic watertight drysuit zipper closed teeth detail P8110024.jpg|thumb|Plastic watertight dry suit zipper: detail of closed teeth showing interlock above and (not visible) below the seal edge.]]

Modern dry suits have a watertight [[zipper]] for entry and exit. The original bronze-toothed version was developed by [[NASA]] to hold air inside [[space suit]]s. This complex and special zipper is one of the most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy-duty, medium, and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses injection moulded plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The zipper is commonly installed across the back of the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the torso, which allows self-donning.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|59}} Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early ''Poseidon Unisuit''), up one side of the front, around the back of the neck and partway back down the front (later model ''Poseidon Unisuit''&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|50}}) or on a wide tubular chest entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the waist after sealing the zip (some ''Typhoon'' suits). The waterproof-zipper is stiff, and cannot stretch at all, which can make it difficult for a user to get into and out of the suit.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|43}} Dry suits may also be fitted with an extra waterproof "fly", "relief" or "convenience" zipper to let the user urinate when out of the water when the suit is worn for long periods.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

Before truly watertight zippers were invented, other methods of keeping the suit waterproof at the entry point were used, with the most common being a long rubber entry tunnel which would be folded shut, then rolled together from the sides and finally folded and clamped with a metal clip.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|14}} An early example was the [[Sladen suit]], where the entry tunnel was at the front of the torso. The Louisiana-based dry suit company Aquala makes a "historical" diving suit of that kind.&lt;ref name="Aquala historical" /&gt; Another type of entry featured a rubber tunnel that protruded through a non-watertight zipper. The tunnel would be rolled shut and the zipper closed to hold the roll in place.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Accessories===

====Thermal undersuits====

Most drysuits do not provide sufficient insulation without suitable undergarments. The type of undergarment selected will depend on the water temperature, type of suit and dive plan. The purpose of the undergarment is to maintain the diver in comfortable thermal balance, where the heat lost is balanced by the heat generated by the diver. More insulation is needed for colder conditions and for less energetic diving activity.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

The principle of layering can be used to provide a wider range of insulation possibilities from a relatively small range of underwear items, however this can only be done before entering the water. Most dry suit underwear insulates by a trapped layer of air in the garment, and this is largely lost if the air is replaced by water in a flooded suit, so as a general rule, insulation is proportional to the combined thickness of the undergarments. The layering principle shows that the option of two layers of undergarment in two thicknesses allows three levels of insulation to be selected. Thin only, thick only, and both layers.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

Some materials have better insulating properties than other when wet, and will keep the diver warmer if the suit leaks or floods. The best dry suit undergarment is the thinnest material that will provide the required insulation, by trapping air in the smallest spaces. These will require less air in the suit and thus less excess buoyancy for which weighting will be required.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

The moisture given off by the human body, even when not exercising and sweating, will condense against the inside of the dry suit, and the way this condensate is handled by the underwear material will influence the comfort of the diver. If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.&lt;ref name="Lang and Sayer 2007" /&gt;

The fit of the underwear should allow the same range of movement as the suit itself, and together should allow the diver to bend, [[Squatting position|squat]], kneel, climb a ladder, fin and reach all critical parts of the diving equipment. Underwear which is flexible and stretches, particularly at the joints, will allow the diver more freedom of movement, and is less likely to chafe, and materials which resist compaction under light pressure will maintain a more even thickness in use, which will provide better insulation for the same overall volume.&lt;ref name="Barsky" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

For cold-water use, especially diving under ice, the user will usually wear a thick undersuit in a membrane dry suit. The thickness of undersuits varies and can be chosen by the wearer according to the water temperature. [[Thinsulate]] is one of the preferred fabrics for undersuits.&lt;ref name=Audet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sterba /&gt;

The hydrophobic qualities of Thinsulate help prevent water absorption which helps to maintain the insulating airspace even in the presence of free water.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;  More recently, [[aerogel]] material is being added to conventional undergarments to increase the insulating properties of those garments.&lt;ref name=Nuckols /&gt; [[Polar fleece]] is a good insulator with good stretch, is lightweight, and dries quickly if it gets wet. It is also hypoallergenic and comfortable against the skin. Polyester liners can add to the insulation and will wick perspiration away from the skin. Cotton is not recommended as it absorbs moisture and saturates easily, and will then rapidly conduct heat away from the body. Most dry-suit underwear is full length, either as a one piece or jacket and trousers, but a vest may be added for extra insulation on the torso, and a "Farmer John" style trousers with jacket is flexible and puts extra insulation where it is most useful.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

Neoprene dry suits are made from a foam-rubber sheet containing tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can eliminate the need for an under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth in the same way as for a wetsuit.&lt;ref name="Barsky" /&gt;{{rp|55}} Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits.&lt;ref name="Barsky" /&gt;{{rp|57}} A neoprene wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any closed cell suit.

Undersuits used for surface watersports are generally thinner than those used for diving, and are commonly made from fleece material.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Suspenders====
Some dry suits are provided with internally attached suspenders which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up when the top part of the suit has not yet been fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if the suit is partly removed between dives for comfort. The suspenders also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

====Gloves, mitts, and three-finger mitts====
Dry suits may have wrist seals, permanently attached gloves or mitts, or removable dry gloves connected by attachment rings.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|84}}

Permanently attached gloves or mitts are unusual, It is more common for them to be connected by attachment rings. Either way, the absence of a wrist seal makes getting in and out of the suit much easier since there is no need for the suit to tightly seal around the wrists. It may be necessary to use a wrist strap to prevent loose gloves pulling off the hands when filled with air. Dry gloves can also be fitted over a wrist seal, which prevents leakage into the sleeves if the gloves are penetrated.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Full-hand diving mitts can be sometimes useful in extreme environments such as ice diving, but significantly reduce dexterity and grip.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|84}} Dry gloves and mitts usually allow a dry insulating glove to be worn underneath.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;{{rp|82}}

Three-finger mitts are a compromise between gloves and mittens. In the three-finger mitts, the fingers are arranged with the index finger in a separate pocket to the other three fingers.  This provides slightly better hand-grasping dexterity while still permitting heavy [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] around the hands.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|84}}

====Hoods====
The dry suit may also have an integrated [[Hood (headgear)|hood]], which seals water out around the wearer's face, and helps keep the wearer's head warm. The integrated hood is often latex rubber that fits tightly around the head, but can also be made from neoprene or membrane to allow an insulating cap to be worn under the hood. Care must be taken to avoid the hood making a waterproof seal around either of the ears, as this could cause an [[barotrauma|eardrum bursting]] outwards at depth.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Separate (non integral) hoods are of two types: one which extends only to the base of the neck, and the other a standard wetsuit hood with a large flange. Hoods are never tucked into the neck seal as they would be tucked into a wetsuit, as this would compromise the watertight integrity of the seal. Some suits are designed with a second (non-watertight) "warm neck collar" around the neck seal, which allows the flange of a standard wetsuit hood to tuck in around the outside of the seal. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

====Helmets====
To provide more protection to the head against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] [[diving helmet]] may be worn with the dry suit. This can be separate from the dry suit with its own watertight neck seal, or it can be clamped onto a neck ring attached to the suit, so that air can flow between the helmet and the suit.&lt;ref name="High risk"/&gt;

====Boots====
Most commercial diving dry suits have heavy duty integral [[boot]]s. Sport diving suits may have lightweight integral boots or soft neoprene [[Wetsuit boot|boot]]ies. Rock boots or heavy working boots may also be worn over integral neoprene or latex socks. Boots which are stiff at the ankle make finning inefficient and are unsuitable for many diving applications where mobility is important. If the suit will be used by a diver who needs to fin efficiently on some dives and to walk on sharp surfaces on other dives, it is more effective to wear boots suited to the dive over a dry suit with integral socks.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|44}}

Surface dry suits may have socks or ankle seals fitted. Socks are normally made from latex rubber or from a breathable material similar to the rest of the suit. An outer boot or shoe would normally be worn over these socks to protect them from wear and the risk of puncture. The outer boot also provides more warmth than the thin layer of latex. A regular sock (e.g. a woollen sock) would normally be worn inside the drysuit sock for comfort.&lt;ref name="Biardo" /&gt; Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better foot control of [[water ski]]s and [[surfboard]]s. Survival suits may have neoprene socks of the same material as the suit, with tougher soles and ankle ties to keep them on the feet, as the "one-size fits all" socks must be too big for most users.&lt;ref name=mustangsurvival /&gt;&lt;ref name=mustangusermanual /&gt;

====Attachment rings====
[[Image:Dry suit latex seals.jpg|thumb|right|Dry suits with latex seals; Top: quick-change seal (Viking ring); Bottom: glued seal.]]
Attachment rings allow separate neck seals, gloves, and (less commonly) boots to be joined to the suit with a watertight seal. The older style attachment ring system uses a support ring inside the suit and a clamping band outside the suit to tightly hold the suit and the separate hood/boot/glove together. They were also used with the neck seals of some old British frogman-type dry suits.

More recently, on both commercial and recreational suits, "quick-change" rings have become increasingly common. These are permanently glued to the suit and accessories, either during manufacture or as a retrofit. These systems form a watertight seal between the suit and components using soft rings on both pieces that comprise a series of interlocking channels, similar in principle to a common food storage bag. Quick-change rings allow a diver to easily replace a damaged seal on the surface with no tools or adhesives, or to change attachments depending on conditions–for example, choosing between dry gloves and standard wrist seals. Different manufacturers' ring systems are generally incompatible, so the diver must choose accessories that are designed for the ring system on his or her suit.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|41}}

====Valves====
[[File:Dry suit inflation valve P8170013.jpg|thumb|left|Inflation valve on neoprene suit]]
[[File:Dry suit auto dump valve P8170014.jpg|thumb|Auto dump valve on neoprene suit]]
Dry suits are equipped with an inflation valve and at least one exhaust valve.

The inflation valve allows the diver to compensate for air compression in the suit on descent.  Suit compression squeezes the suit uncomfortably onto the diver's body, especially where the suit folds, it hinders the diver's freedom of movement, reduces thermal insulation through compression of insulating garments and interferes with buoyancy control.  Compensating gas is taken either from the breathing gas [[Diving cylinder|cylinder]], a small, dedicated inflation cylinder or the umbilical.  Environmentally sealed suits, which are sealed to the helmet, automatically equalise from the breathing gas.

The exhaust valve allows the diver to vent expanding gas from the suit on ascent in order to maintain buoyancy control in the same way that a [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]] must be vented on ascent to avoid an uncontrolled ascent, missed decompression stops, [[decompression sickness]], [[arterial gas embolism]] or [[pulmonary barotrauma]]. The manual exhaust vent may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or supplement a separate automatic over-pressure dump valve on the shoulder.  Automatic valves are pre-set and in most situations can be left at this setting throughout the dive.&lt;ref name=AAUSascents /&gt; Configurations differ but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder and manual vents at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have a watertight seal to the helmet, rely on the helmet exhaust valve and may not have a separate exhaust valve on the suit itself. Older, now obsolete, dry suits had no dedicated vents; venting was achieved by raising an arm and lifting one of the wrist seals or placing a finger in the neck seal.
Surface dry suits do not normally have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.

====Suit inflation gas supply====
[[File:Submersible argon cylinder for dry suit inflation 1.jpg|thumb|Aluminium cylinder and valve intended for argon at a maximum pressure of 139 bar to be used for the inflation of a dry suit while scuba diving]]
Normally, the gas used for dry suit inflation is air from the primary breathing cylinder.  [[Helium]]-based [[breathing gas|gas mixes]] such as [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] or [[heliox]] are avoided for suit inflation because of helium's high [[thermal conductivity]]. Nitrox blends from a [[Decompression stop|decompression cylinder]] have essentially the same thermal conductivity as air but oxygen rich mixes introduce a fire hazard when out of the water. Using a small (1-2 litre), dedicated cylinder avoids these complications; usually this will contain air but [[argon]] may be used instead.  Argon has a low thermal conductivity, which improves insulation by approximately 20% compared to air,&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|24}} without adding any bulk or weight. Unfortunately, the accidental breathing of pure argon results in rapid unconsciousness and probable death.  Consequently, argon cylinders must be clearly marked to prevent the accidental attachment of a breathing regulator or have valves that cannot accept a breathing regulator. To gain the full benefit of argon the suit must be flushed with argon before the dive to remove the air.&lt;ref name=IEEE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=argon/&gt;

Dry suit inflation only applies to diving.  Survival suits and other dry suits designed for wear on the surface have no inflation or dump valves as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.

====Inflation hose====
[[File:Seatec quick disconnect end fitting P8180016.jpg|thumb|left|Seatec quick disconnect end fitting commonly used for dry-suit and buoyancy compensator inflation]]
[[Image:Low pressure air hose 1.jpg|thumb|[[Pressure|Low pressure]] inflation hose with CEJN connector (right) used for some dry suits]]

There are two types of low-pressure hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose.  Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.&lt;ref name="Miflex" /&gt;

====Zipper protection flaps====
Some suits are provided with a flap which can be closed over the outside of the zipper to protect it from being damaged by contact with the diver's equipment or the environment. these flaps may be held in place by velcro or a non-watertight outer zipper.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

====The P-valve====
For commercial divers or technical divers who may spend many hours in a dry suit underwater, it is not practical to have to climb back on board the ship in order to open a waterproof relief zipper and urinate. The P-valve is a urinal built into the suit, which enables a diver to urinate at any time without having to get out of the water, while keeping him or her dry and clean inside the suit.&lt;ref name="pmid22752741" /&gt;

Before putting on the dry suit, the male diver puts on a [[External urine collection devices#Texas catheter|condom catheter]], which is similar to a [[condom]] except that it is made of thicker material with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a screw-down outlet valve (P-valve), opened for use, or a non-return valve to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return equalisation valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device in the form of a wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup. The rim is affixed onto the skin surrounding the labia with medical grade glue. The cup's outlet connects to the drain hose with similar fitting on the suit.&lt;ref name="pmid22752741"/&gt;&lt;ref name="She-P" /&gt;

Risks involved with the use of the P-valve can include [[urinary tract infection]], [[pneumaturia]] and [[Barotrauma|genital squeeze]].&lt;ref name="pmid22752741"/&gt;

Divers expecting the need to urinate in dry suits can also use an adult [[diaper]] / [[diaper|nappy]], which soaks up and retains the urine.&lt;ref name=Barsky/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22752741"/&gt;

====Gaiters, ankle straps and ankle weights====

Most suits have relatively baggy trouser legs to allow passage of the feet to the boots. This can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|121}} Elastic or tailored "[[gaiters]]" can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain horizontal trim. Gaiters may also reduce hydrodynamic drag when finning, reduce the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|45}} Small ankle-weights (typically one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight at the bottom of the suit, and function as short gaiters to constrict the ankle region of suit once the foot is in the boot. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated and decelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more energy from the diver. Gaiters do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|87}}

===="Bio-seals"====

To reduce the contact with latex seals in divers with a latex allergy, a soft elastomer band called a "Bio-seal" can be worn under the latex contact area. These may also reduce friction with the seal and improve watertightness.&lt;ref name="Jackson 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Jack|title=Complete Diving Manual|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=zxuW42R3rbMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=2005|publisher=New Holland Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781843308706|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Active heating====
For applications where passive heating is insufficient, active heating can be used. One of the earliest systems was the tube suit, a set of underwear with a complicated labyrinth of tubes which carried heated water supplied from the surface or the lockout submersible through an additional hose in the diver's umbilical.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; Other active heating systems use electrical heating elements in an undersuit layer, or internal pockets containing hot-packs, sealed plastic bags containing materials which emit latent heat during a phase change.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Applications==
Use of dry suits can conveniently be divided into surface and underwater applications, as the construction of the suit may be optimized for either.

===Surface===
====Boating====
Dry suits are often worn for [[boating]], especially [[sailing]], and on [[personal water craft]] in the winter months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable [[artificial membrane|membrane]] material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day.&lt;ref name="Sailing World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingworld.com/gear/staying-dry-never-felt-so-good|title=Staying Dry Never Felt So Good|last=Reed|first=Dave|date=2 February 2010|work=Sailing World|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=14 November 2016|location=Winter Park, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal [[undersuit]], or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====Water sports====
[[Image:DrySuits.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Kitesurfing|Kitesurfers]] wearing dry suits on [[Long Island]] in winter when the air and water temperatures are near 32&amp;nbsp;°F (0&amp;nbsp;°C).]]
Dry suits are used for [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[kayaking]], [[water skiing]] and other surface water sports where the user is frequently immersed in cold water. These suits are often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type suits are commonly used in the spring and autumn with moderate water temperatures, but Neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water. These provide greater thermal protection in the event of a leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A neoprene bottom also is less likely to allow trapped air to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====Working====
Crew members who must work on the decks of commercial ships wear a type of dry suit also known as an [[immersion suit|immersion survival work suit]]. Single engine aircraft ferry pilots flying between North America and Europe, and helicopter pilots that must fly over the open ocean, must wear a survival suit in the cockpit, so they can continue to fly the aircraft, then exit immediately if the aircraft is ditched in cold water after an engine failure. These suits are also used on shore when working on docks, bridges, or other areas where cold water immersion is a safety risk. They are usually a three-part system consisting of:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* A warm undersuit made of synthetic fabric designed to wick moisture from sweat generated by physical exertion away from the user's skin.
* A dry suit made with a waterproof breathable membrane to let moisture permeate out of the suit.
* A durable outer shell, designed to protect the dry suit, and to carry tools and survival gear. The outer shell may also be equipped with an inflatable bladder to give the wearer additional flotation and freeboard when immersed.

====Survival====
[[File:Diver Pataholm.jpg|thumb|Survival suit]]
Immersion [[survival suit]]s are dry suits carried for use by ship and aircraft crew who will be immersed in cold water if the craft must be abandoned. Unlike immersion survival work suits, these are not intended to be worn all the time, and are only to be used in an emergency. Survival suits will typically be a one-piece design made of fire-retardant neoprene, optimized with quick donning features, and produced in high visibility colours with reflective tape patches.&lt;ref name="mustangsurvival" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mustangusermanual" /&gt;

====Rescue====
Dry suits are also worn by rescue personnel who must enter, or may accidentally enter, cold water. Features of dry suits designed for rescue may be a hybrid of the immersion survival and work suits, since the wearer is not expected to be working in the suit for an extended time. They may also be optimized for a specific task such as ice rescue, or helicopter rescue swimmer.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Underwater===
Dry suits are typically used where the water temperature is below 15&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F), and for extended immersion in water above 15&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F), where discomfort would be experienced by a wet suit user. They are also used with integral boots, and gloves and sealed to the helmet for personal protection when working in and around hazardous liquids.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

====Recreational diving====
Dry suits for recreational diving are made in both [[artificial membrane|membrane]] and [[neoprene]], and primarily differ from surface dry suits in that they have inflation and deflation air valves to maintain neutral buoyancy, and may be slightly more durable.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

====Commercial/military diving====
Dry suits for commercial and military diving tend to be heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as [[underwater welding]]. A boiler suit may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated [[diving helmet]] can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks.&lt;ref name=Steigleman /&gt; These "hazmat suits" are most often made of [[vulcanized rubber]] laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;

Manufacturing processes mainly depend on the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which in the case of neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams on the inside of the suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer.&lt;ref name="WVSAC 2011" /&gt; DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.&lt;ref name=DUI /&gt;

==Care of suit==
[[File:Neoprene drysuit inside out for airing P8110001.jpg|thumb|Neoprene drysuit hanging up inside out for airing]]
Some components are inherently susceptible to damage if not treated with due care.

===Seal damage===

[[File:Cracking of latex rubber dry suit wrist seal P8180008.jpg|thumb|Cracking of latex rubber dry suit wrist seal]]
Latex and silicone seals are easily pierced by sharp objects. Gripping the seal with long fingernails to pull it on or off can cut through the material, while long toenails can damage thin rubber booties when the foot is pushed inside tight-fitting fins.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

Latex is subject to rubber perishing, or "dry rot", where ozone normally present in the air deteriorates the material over time, regardless of use. A latex seal is generally expected to last 1–2 years.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; The useful life can be extended by detaching removable seals when not in use and keeping them in airtight containers. They should also be kept in a cool, dark environment.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|131}}

Latex and silicone seals are elastic, but can be easily torn if overstretched. Powdered [[talc]] can help the seals slide on easier.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

Silicone seals are similar in strength and elasticity to latex, but do not perish in the same way.

Neoprene seals are a tougher and more tear resistant alternative, though they must be correctly sized for the user, as they cannot be adjusted much.  These are much more resistant to perishing than latex.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt; Use of a lubricating liquid such as dishwashing liquid or KY jelly is suggested for donning neoprene wrist seals.&lt;ref name="Divernet2" /&gt;

===Zipper damage===
[[Image:WP zip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Waterproof zipper installed on a membrane type dry suit]]
[[File:Worn dry suit zip detail P8170002.jpg|thumb|Frayed edge of zipper tape]]
Metal toothed watertight zippers rely on pressure between the two rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together in front of the pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|104, 130}} The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Care of plastic zippers includes keeping them clean, lubrication of the slider docking area with a suitable grease, and long term storage with the zipper closed.&lt;ref name="Tizip" /&gt;

On metal toothed zippers, the cut edges of the rubberized fabric of the zipper tapes are susceptible to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually delaminate the edge. The moulded plastic zippers do not have an exposed cut edge, so do not have this weakness.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Hazards of use==

===Hyperthermia on deck before a dive===
Dressing into a dry suit is usually more time-consuming than a wet suit, and may require the assistance of another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time on the deck of a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of [[hyperthermia|overheating]] to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;{{rp|124, 161}}

===Suit squeeze===
During descent the air in the suit is compressed and unless more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become so tight that movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a low pressure gas supply.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

===Excess buoyancy hazard related to excess air===
Dry suits pose their own unique problems compared to wet suit diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage and adjust the air volume inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, in order to prevent over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent, with possibly fatal consequences.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2012" /&gt; Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem when properly set.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

===Suit flooding===
Damage to the lower part of the suit can cause a sudden inrush of very cold water for winter users, or an inrush of contaminated water or chemicals for hazmat divers.
Damage to the upper part of the suit can cause a sudden venting of the air, resulting in a loss of buoyancy and possible uncontrolled descent, followed by flooding with water and loss of thermal insulation, and possible exposure to hazardous materials if the water is contaminated.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|ch.3}}

A flooded suit may contain so much water that the diver cannot climb out of the water because of the weight and inertia. In this case it may be necessary to cut a small slit in the lower part of the leg to let water drain out as the diver rises out of the water. This will take some time, and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with reasonable care.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;

===Diving without a Buoyancy Compensator Device===
Dry suits are not designed to be used as a [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|Buoyancy Compensator Device]] (BCD) and cannot offer the same degree of safety and control as a BCD. However, the fact that it is possible to control buoyancy using a dry suit has led some divers to attempt to control their buoyancy with the dry suit alone and dive without the dedicated BCD normally worn by scuba divers. Although it is possible to dive like this, the risks are higher than when using a buoyancy compensator for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="Nishi" /&gt;{{rp|11–19}}

* The BCD is more robust than a dry suit. Dry suits are not designed to be buoyancy compensators and more prone to failure than BCDs, they have multiple points of failure and can completely flood when a seal tears or a zip breaks or leaks. Wrist and neck seals can vent accidentally; annoying if wearing a BCD, possibly fatal without.
* The vent valves of a BCD are more secure and have backups, often via the inflator hose, the left shoulder valve, the right shoulder valve and sometimes the bottom.  The dry suit has none, other than manipulating the neck and wrist seals, the wrist seals may not be available if wearing certain types of gloves.
* The BCD is designed to act as a flotation device on the surface, the dry suit is not.
* The BCD can be orally inflated if out of air, the dry suit cannot be.
* The lifting power of the dry suit is less.  This is because it is not designed to lift. It may not be sufficient if entering the water overweighted or if required to assist others.  
* If a dry suit floods, the release of the [[Diver weighting system|diving weights]] may not be sufficient to compensate, especially if the cylinders are negatively buoyant.
* It increases the risk on an inversion.  Dry suit inversions are dangerous and are best controlled by minimising the volume of air in the suit. If using the BCD for buoyancy control, and the suit inflation only to avoid a squeeze, the suit will never contain an excess of air.  If it does contain excess air as a result of using it for buoyancy or to compensate for being over-weighted the excess air may migrate to the legs causing the diver to invert to a dangerous legs-up position making venting the dry suit difficult or impossible and leading to an uncontrolled ascent. 
* Maintaining horizontal [[Diver trim|trim]] is more difficult and trim may change suddenly.  Excess air will migrate as the diver changes horizontal attitude and cause dangerous instability.
* No redundancy.  A dry suit might just compensate for an, unlikely, BCD failure but relying on the dry suit alone leaves no redundancy.
* Having a BCD makes it easier for a buddy assisting in an emergency to determine where the buoyancy is located and how to control it.

===Carotid-sinus reflex===
An over-tight neck seal can put pressure on the [[carotid sinus|carotid artery]], causing a reflex which slows the heart, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to the brain, light-headedness and eventual unconsciousness. For this reason, neck seals should be stretched or trimmed to the correct size.&lt;ref name=Hendrick /&gt;

===Accidental body-inversion hazards===

====Underwater====
If there is more air in the dry suit than is needed to counteract "squeeze" on the undersuit, that excess air creates a "bubble" which moves to the highest point of the suit; in an upright diver this is the shoulders. In such cases, divers wearing loose baggy suits need to keep their legs at level or below their waist. Otherwise the bubble quickly moves to the highest point,  and if the legs are above the waist, the bubble moves into the legs and feet, causing the legs to rise, and "inverting" the diver's body into a head-down position.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

The movement of such a large bubble to the legs can be a problem for a number of reasons: It balloons the legs, and it may inflate thin rubber booties enough to cause fins to pop off; a diver without fins has more restricted ability to move and become upright, and also loses the ability to kick downward to maintain depth, so that the bubble expansion problem does not grow worse. Movement of gas into the legs and feet may also cause special difficulties in drysuits that have air exhaust values only at the shoulders or wrists, because the air in the legs and booties cannot be evacuated while the diver is inverted, and such a diver may be moving toward the surface, causing the problem of expanding air in the suit to grow worse with each meter of lost depth. (Some low-quality buoyancy control devices also cannot vent air, when inverted). If the diver is positively buoyant and rising, the buoyancy of the dry suit becomes uncontrollable after rising through a certain fraction of depth, and there is then an increased risk of a rapid ascent which grows more rapid, as the distance to the surface decrease. The final result of such a run-away inversion is a diver rising all the way to the surface, feet first, in an uncontrolled ascent that is too rapid for decompression safety.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|121}}&lt;ref name=divernet /&gt;

When the suit is being used correctly, the bubble inside it is relatively small, and its movement is not important. The bubble may be large for a variety of reasons: if a diver has ascended without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas to dry suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra air has been added to the suit at some point to make the diver neutrally buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. Some divers ensure that the bubble remains at the top of their body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to avoid squeeze inside the drysuit.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|111}}

The recommended solution in all such "inversion accidents", is for the wearer to bend at the knees and powerfully flap the arms to do a backward or forward roll to the upright position and then vent the suit, if needed, by manually opening the neck seal (sometimes called "burping the suit") by breaking the seal-neck contact with a finger.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

====Surface====
Surface dry suit users can face a similar inversion problem. The problem is more acute when not wearing a [[buoyancy compensator (diving)|personal flotation device]] (life vest) over the dry suit. For surface dry suit users, the inversion can be much more critical since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

It is not a problem for close-fitting neoprene suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy surface dry suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much excess air as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the arms around the knees, and then having an assistant zip the suit shut while it is stretched out tightly. Excess air can also be "burped" out of the neck or cuff seal.&lt;ref name="Dry suit diving" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Divers - Illustrated London News Feb 6 1873-2.PNG|thumb|[[Augustus Siebe|Siebe's]] improved design in 1873, from the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''. The helmet's basic features can be seen: A helmet, supplied with air from the surface, and a waterproof suit. The corselet of the helmet is clamped onto the suit with wingnuts over a rubber flange.]]
[[File:" 10 - ITALY - Gamma-della-X.gif|thumb|Italian frogman of the Decima Flottiglia]]
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A26571.jpg|thumb|Royal Navy divers in Sladen suits during the Second World War]]
[[File:British navy frogman.jpg|thumb|British navy frogman in dry suit c1945]]
In the 1830s the Deane brothers asked Augustus Siebe to improve their underwater helmet design.&lt;ref name=acott /&gt; Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a [[diving helmet|helmet]] clamped to a full length watertight [[canvas]] [[diving suit]]. The real success of the equipment was a [[valve]] in the helmet that meant that it could not flood no matter how the diver moved.

Siebe introduced various modifications on his diving dress design to accommodate the requirements of the salvage team on the wreck of the [[HMS Royal George (1756)|HMS ''Royal George'']], including making the helmet be detachable from the [[Standard diving dress#Corselet|corselet]]; his improved design gave rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised [[underwater]] [[civil engineering]], underwater [[Marine salvage|salvage]], [[commercial diving]] and [[naval diving]].&lt;ref name=acott/&gt;

In France in the 1860s, Rouquayrol and Denayrouze developed a single stage demand regulator with a small low pressure reservoir, to make more economical use of surface supplied air pumped by manpower. This was originally used without any form of mask or helmet, but vision was poor, and the "pig-snout" copper mask was developed in 1866 to provide a clearer view through a glass faceplate on a copper mask clamped to the neck opening of the suit. This was soon improved to become a three-bolt helmet supported by a corselet (1867). Later versions were fitted for free-flow air supply.&lt;ref name="Denayrouze 1" /&gt;

These dry suits were directly coupled to the air space in the helmet, and buoyancy was not sufficiently controllable to allow swimming - the diver needed to remain upright when descending or ascending to allow venting of excess air through the helmet exhaust valve, or risk a potentially fatal blowup.(ref usn training film - see Standard diving dress) With these suits the diver would be weighted sufficiently to allow reasonably stable walking on the bottom, and would either be pulled up and lowered by the tenders, or would slide down the shotline and climb back up it. Great care would be taken in normal diving to avoid over-inflation of the suit underwater as this could lead to a runaway ascent.

The earliest suits were made of waterproofed canvas invented by [[Charles Macintosh|Charles Mackintosh]]. From the late 1800s and throughout most of the 20th century, most suits consisted of a solid sheet of rubber between layers of tan [[twill]]. Their thick [[vulcanized rubber]] collar is clamped to the [[corselet]] making the joint [[Waterproofing|waterproof]]. The inner collar (bib) was made of the same material as the suit and pulled up inside the corselet and around the diver's neck. The space between the bib and corselet would trap most condensation and minor leakage in the helmet, keeping the diver dry. The sleeves could be fitted with integral gloves or rubber wrist seals and the suit legs ended in integral socks.&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt;

The twill was available in heavy, medium, and light grades, with the heavy having the best resistance to abrasion and puncture against rough surfaces like [[barnacles]], rocks and the jagged edges of wreckage. Vulnerable areas were reinforced by extra layers of fabric.&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt; Different types of dress are defined by the clamping of the collar seal to the rim of the corselet or to the joint between bonnet and corselet, and the number of bolts used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Denayrouze 2" /&gt; The legs may be laced at the back to limit inflated volume, which could prevent excess gas from getting trapped in the legs and dragging an inverted diver to the surface.&lt;ref name="davis1955" /&gt;{{rp|56}}&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt; In normal UK commercial diving activities, the legs often did not have the lace up option.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The rubberised fabric was waterproof, as was the seal to the helmet and the cuff seals, so the diver remains dry – a big advantage during long dives – and wears sufficient clothing under the suit to keep warm depending on the water temperature and expected level of exertion.&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt; The suit was usually a very baggy fit on the diver, and if over-inflated, would be too bulky to allow the diver to reach the control valves for air supply and exhaust. This contributed to the risk of suit blowup, which could cause an uncontrollable buoyant ascent, with high risk of decompression illness. To add to this problem, a runaway ascent could cause sufficient internal pressure to burst the seal at the corselet, which could result in a loss of buoyancy, and the injured diver sinking back to the bottom in a flooded suit. Consequently, divers would ensure that they remained sufficiently negative when underwater to minimise this risk. The bulkiness of fit, weighted boots and lack of fins made swimming impracticable. At the surface the diver could struggle a short distance using the arms, but underwater would normally walk on the bottom and climb up and down over obstacles, taking care to avoid passing under anything that could foul the air hose.&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt;

The [[Pirelli]] dry suit was designed in the 1930s and used by [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian frogmen]] during World War II. It became available for recreational divers after the war and was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.&lt;ref name="Bech" /&gt;

[[Frogman#United Kingdom|British frogmen]] of World War II and for some time afterwards used a similar one or two piece rubberized knit fabric suit by [[Siebe Gorman]]. They produced the one-piece front-entry [[Sladen suit]] with integral rubber helmet, developed by the [[British Admiralty]] for use with [[manned torpedo]]es, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers shod with moulded rubber soles. The two parts were sealed by rolling the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were held in place by a separate rubber cummerbund. Soft sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of  woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised stockinette, with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.&lt;ref name="Siebe-Gorman" /&gt;

In 1945 the Spearfisherman Company, owned by Arthur Brown, of Huntington Beach, California was approached by the US Navy to produce a rubber suit. These were advertised in the first issue of the Skin Diver magazine in December 1951, as “seamless, one-piece, pure gum rubber, nude freedom frogman suits”. These were entered by a chute which was folded and clamped to seal, and were available as full length or shortie suits with integral hood. Later versions had a neck level entry chute and a nape valve to purge trapped air. The shortie version was also rebranded as Kellys ''7-seas'' suit.&lt;ref name="Spearfisherman"/&gt;

A seamless dipped latex two-piece suit by an unidentified manufacturer, apparently marketed exclusively for women. was catalogued by [[Palley's]] of California in the early 1950s. The suit was made in two sections, connected by a rolled overlap similar to the Pirelli suits, and were available in long or short leg versions and long or short sleeved versions, all with integral neck, and cuff or arm and thigh seals. A separate hood was also available, and optional boots for the long leg version.&lt;ref name="Seamless" /&gt;

Waterwear of Newport Beach, California, produced the natural gum-rubber ''Seal'' suit for [[US Divers]] from 1953 or earlier. Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or back entry. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved neck ring, and clamping with a large elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt and pants were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.&lt;ref name="US Divers" /&gt;

By the mid-1950s, [[C.E. Heinke &amp; Co. Ltd.]], an established manufacturer of [[Standard diving equipment]], had diversified into recreational underwater swimming equipment, including the ''Delta'' dry suit, made from natural rubber on a stockinette base. The basic Delta was a two piece suit made up of a jacket with neck seal and trousers with ankle seals which could be worn over woolen undergarments. The full suit included integral hood and feet. The overlapped and rolled waist seal was held in place by a cummerbund.&lt;ref name="Delta" /&gt;

For a few years after [[C.E. Heinke &amp; Co. Ltd.]] was taken over by [[Siebe Gorman|Siebe-Gorman and Company]] in 1961, dry suits were marketed under the Siebe-Heinke label. The Siebe-Heinke ''Dip Suit'' for recreational diving, swimming, yachting and fishing, was advertised in [[Lillywhites]]’ 1964 underwater catalogue. The standard Dip Suit was a set of seamless black dipped-latex jacket with neck and cuff seals, and trousers with separate yellow latex waist-seal [[cummerbund]]. A yellow hood and black protective over-bootees were optional extras. Small, medium and large sizes were available.&lt;ref name="Dip suit" /&gt;
The Siebe-Heinke ''Frogman'' dry suit for professional and recreational use was introduced in 1963. It was available in [[stockinette]] proofed with black rubber, or proofed fawn [[twill]]. The suit consisted of a set of booted trousers with reinforced soles or optional ankle seals, and a jacket with cuff seals and an option between a neck seal or integral hood. The two parts were connected by a rolled waist seal held in place by a rubber cummerbund. Sizes available were small, medium, large short and large.&lt;ref name="Frogman suits" /&gt;

In 1955, [[Healthways]] retailed ''Carib'' drysuits, made of 3-ply translucent gum rubber, and available in long and short versions. Entry was by a front chute with rubber band closure. The full version included an integral hood and covered the feet.&lt;ref name="Healthways" /&gt; In 1957, they added the ''Aqua King'' and ''Aqua Flite'' dry suits to their product range. The Aqua King suit was a full-length waist entry suit, comprising hood, long sleeved shirt, booted pants and waistline sealing ring, and was made of seamless latex rubber. All these suits were available in small medium and large sizes.&lt;ref name="Healthways Aqua" /&gt;

[[Voit|W.J. Voit Rubber Corporation]] of New York, Danville and Los Angeles mamufactured the one-piece front-entry VDS10 and two-piece waist-entry VDS11 full dry suits in two ply lightweight gum rubber with integral boots and hood.  These were available completed or as kits for home assembly.&lt;ref name="Voit" /&gt;

The UK-based [[Dunlop Rubber Company]] produced drysuits for military and commercial divers and the Dunlop Aquafort range for recreational use.&lt;ref name="Dunlop" /&gt;

Bel-Aqua Water Sports Company of Los Angeles (later [[Aquala Sports Manufacturing Company]]) marketed dry suits designed and manufactured by Bill Barada from 1954 or earlier. These were front entry one-piece or waist entry two piece suits with optional hood in 3-ply rubber, with optional integral hood, intended to be worn over insulating underwear suited to the water temperature. The front entry was sealed by binding the entry chute with a length of surgical rubber, and waist entry was sealed by rolling the overlap over a rubber ring. Boots, cuff and collar were moulded rubber. These were available in small, medium or large and were also available in kit form.&lt;ref name="Bel-Aqua" /&gt;

So-Lo Marx Rubber Company produced Skooba-"totes" dry suits from the late 1950s. These two piece seamless rubber suits with "ring and rail" waist seal, reinforced feet and optional hood were available in several colours over the years including green, brown, yellow and red. Sizes ranged from extra small to extra large.&lt;ref name=Skooba /&gt;

The Dolphin Manufacturing Company of California designed and manufactured rubber spearfishing suits in the 1950s. Trading as Dolphin Enterprises, it sold the original front-entry Dolphin suits in ready-made and kit forms, before launching a new design 2-ply pocket entry suit. The Dolphin suit was available in four sizes and at least three colours (green, kelp and sand) with a tie-off sealed front-entry chute, hood and moulded boots. The company appears to have changed its name again to “Penguin Suits” after moving to Long Beach, California with the pocket entry suit as its leading product.&lt;ref name="Dolphin" /&gt; Penguin suits marketed the one piece P1 suit with pocket entry, and the two-piece P2 suit with waist entry and roll seal, in red, blue or black including seamless moulded boots with scuff soles and an optional hood.&lt;ref name="Penguin" /&gt;

===Introduction of the watertight zipper and variable volume dry suit===
Development of space-suits led to the pressure-tight zipper, first manufactured by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956.&lt;ref name="Barsky" /&gt; The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This was followed by the Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced  through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.&lt;ref name="Barsky" /&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name=Insulan /&gt;&lt;ref name="SI Tech valve manual" /&gt;

====NCAA Football====
=====Division I=====
======Football Bowl Subdivision (Formerly I-A)======
{{see also|Mythical national championship}}
The problems inherent in identifying sports dynasties are exacerbated in [[NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision]], where the national champion is determined, at least in part, by poll rather than through a tournament. These polls, however, are largely based on win-loss records, thereby relying on minimal subjectivity.  When fans of a sport cannot agree on which team within a league or other organization should be considered as holding that organization's championship, discussing whether a team has become a dynasty is more difficult. Because of these problems, teams that consistently win their conference championship and are frequently in contention for national championships are termed dynasties more often than a similarly performing team in another sport or division might.

== Dynasties in question ==

Most disputes about dynasties relate to teams that dominated within a conference or division, but either failed to win championships or infrequently won championships.  This is exacerbated in [[NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly Division I-A), where the national champion is determined, at least in part, by poll rather than through a tournament.

* [[Atlanta Braves]] Won 14 straight division titles from 1991-2005, and won 5 NL pennates during the 1990s, but were only able to win 1 World Series.

*[[Buffalo Bills]] won 4 AFC Championships in a row from 1990–1993 (three times by a spread of greater than 14 points), the only team ever to do so, and for this they are sometimes considered a dynasty.&lt;ref name="SI Dynasties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woulda, shoulda, coulda been a dynasty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.espn.go.com/columns/kreidler_mark/1404546.html |title=Woulda, shoulda, coulda been a dynasty |author=Kreidler, Mark |publisher=ESPN |date=11 July 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they went on to lose the [[Super Bowl]] all four times; the Bills' AFC dominance partially overlapped with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] dynasty.
* [[Boise State Broncos football]] from 1998 to 2008. At 113–26, their 81.29% win rate was the highest in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=jn-petersen112708&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Bluer pastures suit Petersen |author=King, Jason |publisher=Yahoo!

&lt;!--Please see the talk page and discussion, whereupon it was agreed that Spurs should be included in the dynasty section as well as dynasty in question --&gt;
* [[Detroit Red Wings]] of the mid-1990s through the late 2000s. Although not officially listed by the NHL as a dynasty, the Red Wings won 4 Stanley Cups in 11 seasons (1997, 1998, 2002, 2008) and went to the Stanley Cup Finals six times in fourteen seasons ([[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]], [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]], [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]], [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|2008]], [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals|and 2009]]). The Red Wings had the best team record during both the 1990s and 2000s, accumulating the most points of any franchise during each decade.

*[[San Francisco Giants]]: From [[2010 San Francisco Giants season|2010]] to [[2014 San Francisco Giants season|2014]]. Led by manager [[Bruce Bochy]], [[Buster Posey]], [[Madison Bumgarner]], [[Pablo Sandoval]] and [[Hunter Pence]]. The Giants won three World Series Championships in a 5-year span ([[2010 World Series|2010]], [[2012 World Series|2012]], and [[2014 World Series|2014]]). They are only the second NL team ever, since the 1940s [[St. Louis Cardinals]], to do so. However, despite winning three championships, many do not consider the Giants a dynasty because they did not win consecutive titles nor did they win their division or make the playoffs in the years between (2011 and 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3547449/san-francisco-giants-world-series-madison-bumgarner/|title=Dynasty!

'''Elephant polo''' is a variant of [[polo]] played while riding [[elephant]]s. It is played in [[Nepal]], [[Rajasthan]] ([[India]]), and [[Thailand]]. England and Scotland regularly field teams. Equipment consists of a standard polo ball and six to ten foot cane (similar to bamboo) sticks with a polo mallet head on the end. The pitch is three-quarters of the length of a standard polo pitch, due to the lower speed of the elephants. Two people ride each elephant; the elephants are steered by [[mahout]]s, while the player tells the [[mahout]] which way to go and hits the ball.

Elephant polo originated in Meghauli, Nepal. Tiger Tops in Nepal remains the headquarters of elephant polo and the site of the World Elephant Polo Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bushell at elephant polo World Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7768225.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2008 |quote=A team from England have become the new world champions of elephant polo. Air Tuskers beat Scotland's Chivas, on Friday in Southern Nepal.|accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephant Polo in Nepal and Thailand is played under the auspices of the [[World Elephant Polo Association]]. WEPA enforces strict rules regarding elephant welfare and game play. Other tournaments, such as those played in India and Sri Lanka, are managed independently of each other and the World Elephant Polo Association.  Sri Lanka held an annual tournament in Galle under the auspices of the Ceylon Elephant Polo Association. In 2007 an elephant went on a rampage during a game, injuring two players and destroying the Spanish team's minibus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Why you should never make an elephant angry |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/why-you-should-never-make-an-elephant-angry/story-e6freo8c-1111113010144 |quote=The four-tonne, 2.8m pachyderm threw off his mahout and U.S. rider as the island's sixth annual elephant polo tournament got under way, rampaging off the pitch and attacking the Spanish team's minibus. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Now]] via [[Daily Mail]] |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of cruel treatment of polo elephants, made by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], have led to match cancellation, sponsorship withdrawal and the removal of references to elephant polo records in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Richa |last1=Shukla |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-03/people/28358820_1_elephant-festival-rajasthan-polo-club-polo-lovers |title=For the record: No elephant polo |newspaper=[[Times Of India]] |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8714257/Cruel-elephant-polo-match-cancelled-in-Jaipur.html |title='Cruel' elephant polo match cancelled in Jaipur |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/elephant-polo-tournament-canceled-in-india-over-cruelty-concerns/460605 |title=Elephant Polo Tournament Canceled in India Over Cruelty Concerns |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] |date= |accessdate=17 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021732/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/elephant-polo-tournament-canceled-in-india-over-cruelty-concerns/460605 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Jason |title=On World Animal Day, it's time to end elephant polo |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30355759 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=The Nation |date=4 October 2018 |format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thailand Elephant Polo Association announced in October 2018 that it will end polo matches in Thailand. A polo tournament had been held annually at Anantara Hotel Bangkok owned by [[Minor Hotels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heinecke |first1=William E |authorlink=William Heinecke|title=Like PETA, Minor Hotels is serious about elephant welfare in Thailand |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30356000 |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=The Nation |date=8 October 2018 |format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American and Canadian [[sports]], a '''fight song''' is a [[song]] associated with a [[team]]. In both [[professional]] and [[amateur sports]], fight songs are a popular way for fans to cheer for their team, and are also laden with history; in singing a fight song, fans feel part of a large, time-honored tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/High_School_Fight_Songs|title=High School Fight Songs {{!}} LoveToKnow|work=LoveToKnow|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "fight song" is primarily used in the United States, the use of fight songs is commonplace around the world, but they may also be referred to as '''team anthems''', '''team songs''' or '''games songs''' in other countries, even such as [[Australia]], [[Mexico]] and [[New Zealand]]. Fight songs differ from [[stadium anthem]]s, used for similar purposes, in that they are usually written specifically for the purposes of the team, whereas stadium anthems are not.

Hundreds of [[college]]s have fight songs, some of which are over a century old. The oldest collegiate fight song in the United States is [[Boston College#For Boston|Boston College's]] "For Boston", composed by T.J. Hurley in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://at.bc.edu/songsofbc/ |title=@BC » Feature Archive » Beyond "For Boston" |publisher=At.bc.edu |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest games songs in Australia is [[Melbourne Grammar]]'s 'Play Together, Dark Blue Twenty', which is sung to the tune of '[[Men of Harlech|The March of the Men of Harlech]]'.&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Grammar games song comprises verses from the school's three main sports at the time, Australian rules football, cricket and rowing. For example the Australian rules verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Play together, Dark Blue Twenty,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Long and little marks in plenty;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get your kick, let none prevent ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make the leather roll.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mark your men, keen effort straining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the ball and show your training;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Still though short the time remaining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get another goal.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The chorus between each verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'None our ranks shall sunder.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who will shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;If all are true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To our Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our foemen must go under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Those who played and won before ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bear the Dark Blue flag to glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Grammar to the fore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cricket verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bat with patience unremitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yorker, shooter, break outwitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;All the loose ones freely hitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;That’s the game to play.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Skill the bat and ball in wielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Smartness, judgement in the fielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Iron nerve and pluck unyielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Scarce can lose the day.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The rowing verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Row the race, boys swing together,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sinews tough as cords of leather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Strong, yet light upon the feather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lift her, make her go!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get the catch at the beginning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Churn the tide in eddies spinning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now a spurt, you gain! you’re winning!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Melbourne Grammar, row!

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;A fourth verse with its own chorus was added in the early 20th century with imperial connotations:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Some, in strife of sterner omen,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faced the Empire’s stubborn foemen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fought, as erst their sires - her yeomen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Won the deathless name.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise ye these who stood for Britain,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;These by foreign marksmen smitten;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise them, for their names are written

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;High in storied fame.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;None their ranks could sunder;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who could shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;So stood they true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To the old Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;And all their foes went under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Heroes who - her sons before ye -

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Died or lived, but fought for glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honoured evermore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;While it is not officially discontinued, this addition is no longer sung.

==List of college fight songs==
''Notes:''
*Colleges whose names begin with "University of" or "College of" are listed by traditional name; for example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] is listed under ''C'', not ''U''.
*The service academies are universally referred to in sports media by their associated branch of service. This means, for example, that the [[United States Military Academy]] is found at ''A'', for ''Army''.
* The abbreviation "St.", standing for "Saint", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out. Some schools officially abbreviate the word (such as [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in New York City), while others officially spell it out (such as [[Saint Louis University]]).
*Schools which are normally known by a different contraction of their official name, or an acronym/initialism, are listed by their most common name. Examples:
**The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is most often referred to by American sports media as either "California" or "Cal", meaning it can be found at ''C''.
**The [[University of California, Los Angeles]] is generally called "UCLA", meaning it can be found at ''U''.
** A few branch campuses of state university systems prefer to be known by their city for athletics purposes. Among them are the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] ("Charlotte"), [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]] ("Chattanooga"), [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] ("Omaha"), [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] ("Green Bay"), and [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] ("Milwaukee"). Such schools can be found at the first letter of their city name.
*Other regional campuses, such as [[California State University, Fresno]], are listed by their regional name, meaning the aforementioned school can be found under ''F''.

[[File:HS First XI 1907.JPG|thumb|[[Hale School]] First XI (plus schoolmaster) in 1907]]

The '''first XI''', '''first 11''' or '''starting XI''' are the 11 primary players in an organisation's leading team, particularly a [[cricket]] team or [[association football]] team. A player who is considered part of the starting XI is often the most proficient in his/her particular position - for example, a football club's leading goal scorer will almost always be selected due to his ability and the contribution he/she makes to the team.

'First eleven' is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team - many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; number of players, and this number is often higher than 11. For example, in the [[Premier League]], each club has to designate a squad of 25.

'''Georges Hébert''' (27 April 1875 – 2 August 1957) was a pioneering [[physical education|physical educator]] in the [[France|French]] military who developed a system of physical education and training known as "la méthode naturelle" ("Natural Method"), which combined the training of a wide variety of physical capacities with the training of courage and morality.

==Early life==
[[File:Saint-Pierre (Martinique) avec Montage Pelée.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Saint-Pierre, Island of Martinique, with [[Mount Pelée]] in the background]]

[[File:Pelee 1902 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The remains of St Pierre after the 1902 eruption]]

Hébert was born in [[Paris]]. While an officer in the French Navy prior to the [[First World War]], Hébert was stationed in the town of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St. Pierre]], on the island of [[Martinique]] in the Caribbean Sea.  In 1902 the town fell victim to a catastrophic volcanic eruption.

Hébert coordinated the escape and rescue of some seven hundred people from this disaster. This experience had a profound effect on him, and reinforced his belief that [[athletic skill]] must be combined with courage and [[altruism]]. He eventually developed this ethos into his personal motto, "Être fort pour être utile" ("Being strong to be useful").

Hébert had travelled extensively throughout the world and was impressed by the physical development and movement skills of indigenous peoples in [[Africa]] and elsewhere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant and yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of his system==
Upon his return to [[France]], Hébert became a physical instructor for the French marines in [[Lorient]], where he began to define the principles of his own system of physical education and to create apparatus and exercises to teach his "Natural Method".

Beyond his observations of the natural movements of indigenous people,  Hébert's method is a synthesis of various influences,&lt;ref&gt; Angel 2016, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; including but not limited to:

*The work of his predecessor [[Francisco Amorós y Ondeano|Francisco Amorós]], who published in 1847 ''Nouveau Manuel Complet d'Education Physique, Gymnastique et Morale'' and which encompasses already the full range of practical movement aptitudes
*The work of German Prussian gymnastics educator [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (August 11, 1778 – October 15, 1852), which has also probably influenced the early physical training of the [[United States Marine Corps]]
*The classical representations of the human body in Graeco-Roman statuary and by the ideals of the ancient Greek gymnasia
*The [[naturist]] (although strictly rejecting complete nudism) lifestyle principles of his friend Dr. Paul Carton (1875–1947)
*The influence of [[Georges Demenÿ]] (1850–1917), a French inventor, chronophotographer, filmmaker, and gymnast who emphasized the progressiveness and the scalability of the training

Hebert's system rejected [[remedial gymnastics]] and the popular [[Swedish Method]] of [[physical culture]], which seemed to him unable to develop the human body harmoniously and especially unable to prepare his students with the practical and moral demands of life.

[[File:Eakins history of a jump 1885.jpg|thumb|Photo: "history of a jump" 1885]]

In the same way, Hébert believed, by concentrating on competition and performance, competitive sport diverted physical education both from its physiological ends and its ability to foster sound moral values.

For Georges Hébert, influenced by the teachings of philosopher and educationalist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], only the observation of nature could lead people to the true methods of physical development. He wrote:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The final goal of physical education is to make strong beings. In the purely physical sense, the Natural Method promotes the qualities of organic resistance, muscularity and speed, towards being able to walk, run, jump, move on all fours, to climb, to keep balance, to throw, lift, defend yourself and to swim.&lt;br /&gt;
In the "virile" or energetic sense, the system consists in having sufficient energy, willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;
In the moral sense, education, by elevating the emotions, directs or maintains the moral drive in a useful and beneficial way.&lt;br /&gt;
The true Natural Method, in its broadest sense, must be considered as the result of these three particular forces; it is a physical, virile and moral synthesis. It resides not only in the muscles and the breath, but above all in the "energy" which is used, the will which directs it and the feeling which guides it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hébert defined the guiding principles and fundamental rules of the Natural Method as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to the development of virile qualities, this is obtained by the execution of certain difficult or dangerous exercises requiring the development of these various qualities, for example while seeking to control the fear of falling, of jumping, of rising, of plunging, of walking on an unstable surface, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Legacy and influence==

[[File:1-10-13, Reims, collège d'athlètes, Bouin lieutenant Hébert.jpg|thumb|(1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. Hébert is standing to the left. The man to the right is [[Jean Bouin]], the French mid-distance Olympic runner, who died at age 25 while fighting in the French army during the opening weeks of World War 1, in the year 1914.]]
[[File:Collège d'athlètes et agrès.jpg|thumb|Collège d'athlètes ("Athletes' College") was a physical education training center opened in the city of Reims, in north-east France, in 1913.  The center was designed according to the principles of Georges Hébert. The training center was destroyed during World War 1.&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jean Bouin 1913 - Collège d'athlètes.jpg|thumb| (1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. The swimming pool, located to the side of the large indoor training facility.]]

Georges Hébert's teaching continued to expand between and during the two wars, becoming the standard system of French military physical education.

He was also an early advocate of the benefits of exercise for women. In his work "Muscle and Plastic Beauty", which appeared in 1921, Hébert criticized not only the fashion of [[corsetry]] but also the physical inactivity imposed upon women by contemporary European society. By following the natural method of synthesized physical, energetic and moral development, he wrote, women could develop self-confidence, will-power and athletic ability just as well as their male counterparts.

Hébert wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Georges Hébert - la methode naturelle 
 |url=http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html 
 |publisher=INSEP - Musée de la Marine 
 |language=French 
 |accessdate=2007-09-22 
 |deadurl=yes

 |archivedate=2006-07-18 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A (Natural Method) session is composed of exercises belonging to the ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, equilibrium (balancing), throwing, lifting, defending and swimming.&lt;br /&gt;
A training session consists, then, of exercises in an outdoor environment, perhaps a few hundred meters to several kilometers, during which, one walks, one runs, one jumps, one progresses quadrupedally, one climbs, one walks in unstable balance, one raises and one carries, one throws, one fights and one swims.

This course can be carried out in two ways:
#the natural or spontaneous way; i.e., on an unspecified route through the countryside.
#within an especially designed environment.

All of the exercises can be carried out while progressing through this environment. A session can last from 20 to 60 minutes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Hébert was among the earliest proponents of ''le parcours'', or [[obstacle course]], form of [[physical training]], which is now standard in the military and has led to the development of civilian [[fitness trail]]s and [[confidence courses]]. In fact, woodland challenge courses comprising balance beams, ladders, rope swings and so-on are often still described as "Hebertism" or "Hebertisme" courses both in Europe and in North America. It may even be possible to trace modern [[adventure playground equipment]] back to Hébert's original designs in the early 1900s.

As a former [[sailor]], Hébert may have patterned some of his "stations" on the obstacles that are found on the deck of a ship; he was also a strong proponent of "natural" or spontaneous training in non-designed environments.

The year 1955 marked the 50th birthday of the Natural Method, and Hébert was named Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] by the French government in recognition of his many services to his country. In 1957, George Hébert, by then suffering from general [[paralysis]], cultivated the admiration of his entourage by relearning how to walk, speak and write. He died on August 2 of that year in [[Tourgéville]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], France.

There are still schools and gymnasia throughout Europe that are promoting the Natural Method of physical training, some maintaining their own elaborate "parcours" in natural surroundings.

Most recently, Hébert's teachings have been an important influence on the emergence of [[Parkour]] as a training discipline in its own right. Also, in the first decade of the 21st century, the French American physical education instructor [[Erwan Le Corre]] took inspiration from Hébert's "méthode naturelle" ("natural method") and has expanded on the training to form a system of natural movement which he has named "MovNat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1896516/workout-time-forgot |title=The Workout Time Forgot |publisher=Outside Online |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the ancient Greek [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|''gymnasium'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partridge|1984|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and [[learning space]]s in educational institutions.  "Gym" is also slang for "[[fitness center]]", which is often an area for indoor recreation.

Gymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, fencing area, and so forth are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ravenstein|Hulley|1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing. There were schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8 year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], the ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]'' (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual [[education]] of young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]] and other languages to denote a certain type of school providing [[secondary education]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], whereas in [[English language|English]] the meaning of physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Greek word ''gymnasium'' means "school for naked exercise" and was used to designate a locality for the [[education]] of young men, including physical education (''[[gymnastics]]'', i.e. exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as [[bathing]], and studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek ''gymnasia'' had libraries that could be utilized after relaxing in the baths.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Amsterdam - Gymnasium - 0591.jpg|thumb|right|Inside a gymnasium in Amsterdam]]
The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient [[Persia]], where they were known as ''[[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]]'', areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger [[Thermae|Roman Baths]] often had attached fitness facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with [[mosaic]]s of local champions of sport. Gyms (''i.e''., places for gymnastics) in [[Germany]] were an outgrowth of the ''Turnplatz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-turnplatz-open-air-gymnasium-in-the-hasenheide-1811-48390278.html|title=Stock Photo - Turnplatz (open-air gymnasium) in the Hasenheide, 1811|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outdoor space for gymnastics, which was promoted by German educator [[Friedrich Jahn]] and the [[Turners]], a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in [[Hesse]] in 1852 by Adolph Spiess, an enthusiast for boys' and girls' gymnastics in schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to physical education, exercise science, and sport studies|last=Lumpkin|first=Angela|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education; 9 edition|date=January 29, 2013|isbn=0078022665|location=|pages=226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the Turner movement thrived in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in several cities like Cincinnati and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] which had large [[German American]] populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young [[Lou Gehrig]] would frequent the Turner gym in [[New York City]] with his father.

The [[Boston Young Men's Christian Union]] claims to be "America's First Gym". The [[YMCA]] first organized in [[Boston]] in 1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852. Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs across the country, most of which provided gymnasia for exercise, games, and social interaction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga. Over the course of the 20th century, gymnasia have been reconceptualized to accommodate the popular team and individual games and sports that have supplanted gymnastics in the school [[curriculum]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Today, gymnasia are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. [[colleges]] and [[high school]]s, as well as almost all [[middle school]]s and [[elementary school]]s. These facilities are used for [[physical education]], [[intramural sports]], and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than doubled since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="The Scope of the U.S. Health Club Industry (industry estimates)."|journal=International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA). 2003.|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">[[Image:Gymslip.jpg|thumb|250px|Girls wearing gymslips.]]
A '''gymslip''' is a sleeveless [[tunic]] with a pleated skirt most commonly seen as part of a [[school uniform]] for girls. The term "gymslip" primarily refers to the school uniform; otherwise the term [[pinafore dress]] ([[British English]]) or [[jumper dress]] ([[American English]]) is usually preferred.

The introduction of the gymslip as female athletic wear is credited to Mary Tait, a student of [[Martina Bergman-Österberg]], a pioneer of women's [[physical education]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Richard (1998), "Teacher training in London", in Floud, Roderick; Glynn, Sean, London Higher: The Establishment of Higher Education in London (3rd ed.), Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-485-11524-7}}, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Gymslips were worn by [[gymnast]]s and [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]]s from the 1880s to the 1920s, as they were more mobile than traditional female attire, but still modest enough to keep the underwear hidden during sporting activity. Even in this modest attire, gymslips as athletic wear were still worn strictly out of public view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniforms Exposed|first=Jennifer|last=Craik|publisher=Berg Publishers|date=August 6, 2005|isbn=1-85973-898-2|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Victorian cult of the family and the early years of female sport, published in Gender and Sport|first=Jennifer|last=Hargreaves|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=December 1, 2001|isbn=0-415-25953-3|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not worn as athletic wear, gymslips or pinafore dresses are generally worn over a [[blouse]] and replace a [[skirt]]. A [[blazer]] may be worn over the top. First emerging in the 1900s, by the 1920s it had become compulsory in many private, [[Convent school#Catholic tradition|convent]] and [[high school]]s, and thus became commonly worn by girls as part of their school uniform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fashion Source Book|first=Kathryn|last=McKelvey|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|date=May 1, 2006|isbn=1-4051-2693-0|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a [[blouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php|title=School uniforms in the UK|publisher=Album 1900|language=English|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although now largely replaced by modern-style uniforms, gymslips are still synonymous in Britain with schoolgirls, leading to the slang term "gymslip mum" to describe a [[teenage pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in the USA and the UK|first=Colin|last=Francome|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0-7546-3015-3|date=March 1, 2004|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known modern depictions of gymslips include the [[St. Trinians]] films, and less traditionally, [[Uniform fetishism|schoolgirl uniform pornography]], a use given more public recognition when in 1991 politician [[Clare Short]] condemned the fetish, saying ''"the [[Page Three|Page 3 girl]] in a gymslip may be over 16, but the imagery is clearly intended to present schoolgirls as sexual objects"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.epolitix.com/EN/MPWebsites/Clare+Short/a989e96d-5e05-4043-99a9-d3f8a5b7cb9b.htm|title=Dear Clare...This Is What Women Feel About Page 3|first=Clare|last=Short|date=April 1991|publisher=Radius|isbn=0-09-174915-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235409e.pdf |title= International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rights-based]] document which was adopted by member states of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), on November 18, 2015 during the 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference. This document is the legitimate successor of the '''International Charter of Physical Education and Sport''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13150&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Charter of Physical Education and Sport | date=21 November 1978 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO.

The original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that '''“the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all”'''.
Based on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.

== Objectives ==

In twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development.

The revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.

UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]] said: “The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/international_charter_of_physical_education_revised_to_ensure_more_inclusive_access_to_physical_activity/#.VlL51tHlvs0 |title= Press release issued by UNESCO to announce the adoption of the Sport Charter | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quality Physical Education Policy Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/policy-project/ |title= Quality Physical Education Policy Project |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates how principles and recommendations stipulated in the Charter can be translated into indicators, benchmarks and tools.

== Authors of the Revision ==
The revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs. This new version was carefully examined through sessions of the '''Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS)''' and its '''Permanent Consultative Council (PCC'''), as well as UNESCO’s '''Executive Board'''. It is a follow-up to the '''Declaration of Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps-2013/declaration/|title= Declaration of Berlin| date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was adopted by 600 participants from 121 countries, as an outcome of the '''5th World Conference of Sport Ministers (MINEPS V)'''.

=== MINEPS ===
Created in 1976, the [[International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport]] (MINEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps/ |title=The International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport (MINEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a forum that facilitates intellectual and technical exchange in the field of physical education and sport. MINEPS also serves as an institutional mechanism for a coherent international strategy in this domain.
It is also the only global platform that engages governments, intergovernmental organizations, the sport movement, academia and specialized NGOs.

=== CIGEPS ===
The [[Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport]] (CIGEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/cigeps/ |title= The Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1978 to promote the role and value of sport and its inclusion in public policy. CIGEPS is composed of expert representatives in the field of physical education and sport from 18 UNESCO Member States, each elected for a four-year term. 
In 2015, CIGEPS is composed of the 18 following member states of UNESCO:

In ice hockey, there are two kinds of sending-off [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]]: “[[penalty (ice hockey)#Game misconduct penalty|game misconduct penalty]]” and the more serious “[[penalty (ice hockey)#Match penalty|match penalty]]” which is imposed for deliberately injuring another player as well as attempting to injure another player. Many other penalties automatically become match penalties if injuries actually occur: under NHL rules, ''butt-ending, goalies using blocking glove to the face of another player, head-butting, kicking, punching an unsuspecting player, spearing,'' and ''tape on hands during altercation''&lt;ref&gt;Reference Table 8 – Summary of Match Penalties, NHL, 2013, p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt; must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur; under IIHF rules, ''kneeing&lt;ref&gt;Rule 538 – Kneeing, IIHF, 2010, pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt;'' and ''checking to the head or neck area&lt;ref&gt;Rule 540 – Checking to the Head or Neck Area, IIHF, 2010, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;'' must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur.

[[File:Mrs Graham's XI in 1895.jpg|thumb|280px|The British Ladies Football Club North Team - Mrs Graham's XI was a women's football team (in 1895)]]
'''Mrs Graham's XI''' was a women's [[association football|football]] team formed by [[Helen Matthews]] in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] in 1881. It is considered the first British women's football team and a pioneering team in the history of the sport.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tate|first1=Tim|title=Girls With Balls: The Secret History of Women's Football|date=2013|publisher=John Blake|isbn=1782196862|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYknAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Girls+with+Balls%22+Tate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHj-OYjf_SAhWmh1QKHXUxCJkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Girls%20with%20Balls%22%20Tate&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was not safe for women to play football without harassment, the players used pseudonyms to protect their identities. Matthews, also a goalkeeper for the team, claimed to be "Mrs Graham".&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;

==History==
The first record of the team coming together to play football occurred on 9 May 1881, at Edinburgh's [[Easter Road Stadium]]. The match was billed as a Scotland v England international.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTF&gt;Domeneghetti, R. (2014) ''From the Back Page to the Front Room: Football's journey through the English media'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lmWLBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PT155#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 155] Ockley Books. {{ISBN|1783015586}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Just over a week later, on 20 May 1881,&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt; the teams played in Glasgow in front of 5,000 spectators. The match was abandoned in the 55th minute after a violent pitch invasion during which the women were "roughly jostled", and chased by a mob as they left the grounds.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; Further games resulted in similar pitch invasions, which soon resulting in ending this early attempt to introduce women's football.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

The press coverage, which would dominate coverage of women's football for the next century, was clearly established in 1881: barely disguised contempt regarding player appearance, including costume, and the standard of play,&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; overlaid with a certainty that football was a rough man's game unsuitable for women.&lt;ref name=UB&gt;Laycock, S. &amp; Laycock, P.

The '''multi-stage fitness test''', also known as the '''PACER (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) test''' or the '''beep test''', is a running test used to estimate an athlete's aerobic capacity ([[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]]). In the test, athletes must run from one line to another before a timed beep. Athletes must continue running back and forth, each time reaching the line before the next beep. Once one can no longer run, the test is over and the number of laps is recorded. As the test continues, the time between beeps gets shorter. 

The test is used by sporting organizations around the world along with schools, militaries, and others interested in gauging one's cardiovascular endurance, an important component of overall [[physical fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/beep-variations.htm|title=Variations of the Beep Test|last=|first=|date=|website=Top End Sports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The test was created in 1982 by Luc Léger, a French Gopnik at the University of Montreal&lt;ref&gt;TESTING PHYSICAL FITNESS, EUROFIT Experimental Battery PROVISIONAL HANDBOOK, STRASBOURG 1983 http://www.bitworks-engineering.co.uk/linked/eurofit%20provisional%20handbook%20leger%20beep%20test%201983.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1983 with a starting speed of 8&amp;nbsp;km/h and stages of 2 min duration. It was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology in 1988 in its present form with a starting speed of 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/h and 1 min stages under the name "The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness".&lt;ref name="MSFT_1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Léger |first1=L.A. |last2=Mercier |first2=D. | last3=Gadoury | first3=C. | last4=Lambert | first4=J. |year= 1988 |title=The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness |journal=J Sports Sci |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=93–101 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/02640418808729800|pmid=3184250 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12688827 | volume=33 | issue=4 | title=Secular trends in the performance of children and adolescents (1980-2000): an analysis of 55 studies of the 20m shuttle run test in 11 countries. | year=2003 | journal=Sports Med | pages=285–300 | doi=10.2165/00007256-200333040-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition|President's Council on Youth Fitness]] now recommends schools use the PACER test instead of distance based runs like the mile (1600 m). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pyfp.org/doc/fitnessgram/fg-05-aerobic.pdf|title=Aerobic Capacity|last=|first=|date=|website=President's Council on Youth Fitness|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this include...

* The beeps help young athletes develop a sense of pace
* There is no embarrassment of having everyone wait for the slowest person to finish or people not finishing at all
*Inexperienced runners often complete a race and still have energy left. With the PACER, runners continue until they have no energy remaining, ensuring scores reflect cardiovascular fitness over pacing abilities.
* Even if the distance ultimately completed is similar, psychological studies indicate people find it less daunting  to be told to "run as much as you can" as opposed to "run ___ distance." Making fitness more appealing is important because, after graduation, leading a healthy lifestyle ultimately becomes a matter of personal choice.

==Rules==
The test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 m apart from side to side (or 15 m in small gyms). The runs are synchronized with a pre-recorded [[audio tape]], [[compact disk|CD]] or computer software, which plays [[beep (sound)|beep]]s at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athletes to increase their speed over the course of the test until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). Many people who test people using the multi-stage fitness test allow one level to beep before the person makes the line, but some middle and grade schools allow two missed laps. If the person being tested does not make the next interval, the most recent level they completed is their final score.

The recording is typically structured into 25 'levels', each lasting around 62 s. Usually, the interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/h (see format table), increasing by 0.5&amp;nbsp;km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 3 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test.

==Format==
The original beep test was initially available on [[audio tape]] format. A problem with the tape was that it could stretch over time, or the tape player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of the tape had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating the tape and tape player. [[Digital audio]] formats replaced the tapes, but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.&lt;ref name="MSFT_1988" /&gt;

Inexpensive beep test software is now popular due to modern electronic devices having excellent and consistent timing accuracy. The software generally runs on a portable electronic computer such as a tablet, phone or laptop, making the test easy to organise for teams, and also tracks player fitness over a season. The contemporary accepted format starts at 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/h with levels of 1 minute as described in Leger's and Lambert's paper of 1988.&lt;ref name="MSFT_1988"/&gt;

Some versions of the test include background music. Coaches may also play their own music as the beeps are going.

== World record==
The [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest group beep test is held by [[RAF Honington]], in [[Honington, Suffolk]] where over 586 men and women took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/video_raf_honington_shows_strength_in_numbers_during_bleep_test_record_breaker_1_4119852|title=Video: RAF Honington shows strength in numbers during bleep test record breaker|author=Mariam Ghaemi|work=East Anglian Daily Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The introductory explanation of one multi-stage fitness test, the FitnessGram PACER test, has been widely spread as a [[Internet meme|meme]] and in other comedic ways due to the test's modern use in schools, primarily in physical education classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memeorigins.net/fitnessgram-pacer-test/|title=FitnessGram Pacer Test|date=27 March 2016|work=memeorigins.net|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The FitnessGram™ PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."''

Episode 12 of the Australian children's comedy show [[Little Lunch (TV series)|Little Lunch]] is called 'The Beep Test'. The plot revolves around the school students' reactions to participating in the multi-stage fitness test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/little-lunch/|title=Little Lunch|website=ABC Television|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''omnium''' (from Latin: of all, belonging to all) is a multiple race event in [[track cycling]]. Historically the omnium has had a variety of formats.  In recent years, road racing has also adopted the term to describe multi-day races that feature the three primary road race events ([[time trial]], mass start and [[criterium]]).

==History==
The omnium was re-introduced into the World Championships as a five race track cycling format [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Men's omnium|for men]] in 2007 and [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's omnium|for women]] in 2009. The omnium was changed in 2010 by the UCI to include the elimination race and the distances of the events were lengthened to favour endurance cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birnie|first=Lionel|title=Olympic omnium format unveiled|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/435675/olympic-omnium-format-unveiled.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Cycling Weekly|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The omnium replaced the [[individual pursuit]], the [[points race]], and the [[Madison (cycling)|Madison]] at the [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] beginning in [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]. The change received some criticism from cyclist [[Rebecca Romero]], who was left unable to defend her Olympic title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romero and Wiggins lose out in Olympic cycling shake-up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/8403854.stm|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=BBC Sport: Cycling|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current omnium==
[[File:Ciclismo de pista (28395640743).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Omnium scratch race at the [[Rio Olympics]]]]
From June 2014 until the end of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ Rule Changes Track June 2014|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/52/70/RulechangestrackJune2014-ENG_English.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the omnium as defined by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) consisted of the following six events held over 2 days:

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Individual pursuit]]
#: 4,000 metres for elite men, 3,000 metres for junior men and elite women, and 2,000 metres for junior women
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Track time trial|Time trial]]
#: 1&amp;nbsp;km men, 500 metres women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 6 Kilometre and 500 metres Time Trial|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|work=Part 3: Track Races|publisher=UCI Cycling Regulations|page=21|accessdate=6 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806032756/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Flying lap (against the clock)
# [[Points race]]
#: 40&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 25&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

For the first five events, each winner was awarded 40 points, each second place 38 points, each third place 36, etc.  Riders ranked 21st and below will each be awarded 1 point.
In the Points Race, riders add to and lose points from their totals based on laps gained and lost, and points won in sprints.

After the 2016 season, the three timed events - the sprint time trial, flying lap and individual pursuit were all removed from the event, a [[Points race#Tempo|tempo race]] added, and the event shortened to a  single day. The points race as final race format remains with minor modifications.

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Points race#Tempo|Tempo race]]
# [[Points race]]
#: 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 15&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

The winner of the Omnium is the rider who has obtained the highest total of points.

In the event of a tie in the final ranking, the places in the final sprint of the last event,
the Points Race, breaks the tie. 

A rider must have completed every event in the omnium.

==Road racing omnium==
A road race omnium consists of a [[time trial]], a [[criterium]], and a [[Bike race|mass-start road race]] - typically held across a weekend or other 2-3 day period.  Points are awarded to the top finishers at each event and totaled at the end of the event.  The overall winner for the event is chosen based on the number of accumulated points.  Often, organizers will stipulate that riders must complete each event in order to qualify for the overall prize.

[[Image:Bowlingbahn.jpg|thumb|Automated pinsetter sets up bowling pins]]{{Use American English|date=July 2017}}[[Image:Pinsetter patent 2973204 diagram excerpt crop.png|thumb|Brunswick Model A pinsetter diagram from US patent 2973204.]]

In [[bowling]], a '''pinsetter''', or '''pinspotter''', was originally a person who manually reset [[bowling pin]]s to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned [[bowling ball]]s to players.  Probably due to the nature of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus '''pinboy''' is another name used to describe the job. Gottfried (Fred) Schmidt invented the '''mechanical pinsetter''' and sold the patent in 1941 to [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. &lt;!-- according to [[Timeline of invention]] --&gt; While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.

Many mechanical pinsetters are integrated with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication. While many pinsetters have a manual reset button to use in case the pinsetter does not automatically activate at the correct time, other types have no automatic tracking of the state of the game – especially for the [[candlepin bowling|candlepin]] and [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]] bowling sports which use smaller balls – and are almost always manually activated.

==Common terms and design features==

&lt;!-- this needs illustrations/photos --&gt;
The design of the machines varies, depending both in individual company's hardware designs, and for the particular bowling sport's playing rules and equipment specifications. Several types of bowling make use of different designs for machines due to the different size and shape of the pins and balls.  Common part descriptions for just about all pinspotting units consist of:

* '''Rake/Sweep Bar''' – removes fallen and leftover pins from the pin deck area of the lane. The sweep may also stay lowered throughout the table operating cycle, to act as the primary physical protective barrier against improperly thrown balls
* '''Spotting Deck/Table''' – also used in pre-automated manual units (often, as their sole mechanical device); places a new "rack" of pins onto the lane for the next frame; and in tenpins and duckpins for automatic units, lifts the remaining pins for the sweep to remove fallen pins for the bowler's next roll of the ball in those games
* '''Deck/Table Shield''' ''(Brunswick A series only)'' – a fixed sheet metal enclosure, usually fastened to the spotting table's framework and diagonal forward frame edges, provides secondary protection for the spotting table system from improperly thrown balls (in addition to the sweep bar) and flying pins, and covers the pin chutes that are used to transfer the pins from the characteristic, cage-like Brunswick-design rotating pin storage turret above the table downwards into the deck for transfer onto the lane's pin deck area.
* '''Pit''' – a collection area behind the lane where balls and struck pins collect for sorting, actually a part of any regulation bowling lane.
* '''Pin Elevator''' –  brings pins upwards out of the lane's pit to the top of the unit for re-racking for successive frames, usually in the form of a vertically-oriented toroid-shape system at the extreme rear of the pinspotter for tenpin bowling units, to deliver pins upwards from the pit into the pin storage system. 
* A system of '''pin storage''' for storing the next full "rack" of pins after delivery to it by the pin [[elevator]] system – this can exist within (or as part of) the table, or above and/or behind the table
* '''Ball Return''' (or "Ball Lift") – Removes the bowler's ball from the lane's "pit" and sends it rolling back to the bowler on the ball return track, located between paired lane beds, back to the ball return unit at the "heads" of the lanes. The ball lift's components are designed to physically separate the ball from the fallen pins in the pit, and will not send pins into the ball return track.

===Manually-reloaded spotting table units===
In the decades leading up to the introduction of the fully automatic units, "semi-automatic" pinsetters, such as the "B-1" and "B-10" units made by [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]], basically consisting of just a manually filled "table" similar to those used on the fully automatic units, operating much as the later units' component of the same name operated, were used by human pinsetters to both speed up the manual operation, and assure accuracy of "spotting" the full rack of ten pins for the next frame.[http://oldbowling.com/page3.html] The oldest operational bowling facility in the United States, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s ''[[Holler House]]'', opened in September 1908, is one of the very few all-manually operated alleys remaining in the 21st century that still uses the Brunswick "table-style" manual units.

==[[Ten-pin]] pinsetters==

===AMF pinspotters===
The AMF family of pinspotters, first marketed in 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldbowling.com/page2.html oldbowling.com]&lt;/ref&gt; are the first ones used in quantity in the industry.  They have changed little since the mass-produced 82-30 version.  There are three main pinspotter models, the aforementioned 82-30 (no longer produced, but still in common use, ever since the 1960s US bowling boom and the early career of [[Dick Weber]]), the 82-70 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M prototyped in 1962], and still in production, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M since 1963]) and the newest versions, the 82-90 and the 82-90XLI, both of which use the 82-70's general mechanical design. AMF pinspotters were originated by [[American Machine and Foundry]] and are now manufactured by [[QubicaAMF Worldwide]]. All operate generally the same way with small improvements.

The 82-30's operation and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DogVYVOqMNg pioneering 82-10 experimental model], which depended much on the use of suction to hold the pins in a double-sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they got to the top of the machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around each neck of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten "pindicator" lights – pioneered by AMF in May 1953 – in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the pinspotter's masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins.

After the table lifts the remaining pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then returns to the guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running [[conveyor belt|carpet belt]] at the bottom of the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a "distributor arm" that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US2983510-1.png an "arrowhead"-planform guide rail atop the spotting table] governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GI5VvqXQBU as seen here], to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or "spotting cups" as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical "spotting cup" bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45° angle with each "cup" inclined, pin-base-forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w0p_C250Iw as seen here] to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame. Should the spotting cups not yet be filled with a full rack of ten pins for the next frame, the sweep bar pauses in its forward "guard" position after its rearwards stroke to clear any fallen pins, until the cups all have pins in them, with the table only descending when the cups have all filled, and are ready to set them onto the pindeck.

Beginning in December 1961, the 82-30 units also became famous for having the "Sparemaker" version of the earlier triangular pindicator screen on their masking units as advertised by AMF and their staff's pro bowler Dick Weber, which added a set of eleven lighted "arrows" to the usual numbered ten lights for standing pins, triangular corner lights that indicated the first or second ball to be rolled, and separate lights to indicate a foul, or a strike.  The "arrows" were for the purpose of advising an inexperienced bowler to assist in [[spare (bowling)|spare]] conversion, by indicating where a second ball delivery should hit the remaining pins for a successful conversion, and were triggered by appropriate combinations of standing pins that helped the machine select which one of the eleven arrows to illuminate. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/iwilldare/691217804/sizes/l/ Rear view of an AMF Magic Triangle screen] [http://www.google.com/patents?id=_ttNAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false and the patent document for it]

There have been specific upgrades and improvements made to the machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor-operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a [[microprocessor]]-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7–10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine status indicator lights, much more sophisticated "pin storage" design, single control centers that handle two machines, and perhaps the most important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the machine down to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70.

[[QubicaAMF Worldwide]] has also introduced many different scoring systems that are compatible with all pinsetters and pinspotters.

===Brunswick A series pinsetters===
The [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]] Model A, dating from 1956, as well as the developed '''A2''' (1962) and the '''JetBack''' (1965) versions of it, work as follows.

First, the balls and pins are pushed off the end of the lane by the rake onto a shaking board the width of the lane, in place of the AMF-variety carpet belt. This "shaker" transfers the ball and pins to the rear of the pit, behind the lane's pindeck. Two large rotating wheels, at the center rear of the unit, are situated with their common axis along the bowling lane. The ball-lift wheel is the one closer to the bowler and is smooth on its inside surfaces, with enough space between its inner and outer surfaces to allow the fallen pins to go rearwards through it into the rear-located pin-wheel (or pin elevator), placed behind the ball return wheel which has seven pockets, which capture the pins, and is somewhat similar to the AMF unit's design.

When a ball rolls back to the ball-lift wheel, friction lifts the ball up to the side where it catches on two lift rods covered with a rubber material. Wedged in between, the ball is rolled upward. When it gets to the top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located at the head of the ball return track, where it is deposited.

When a pin rolls back, the smaller diameter of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first.  The wheel brings the pin to the top and drops it into a metal tray, called a "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a [[conveyor belt]] lifts the pin up towards the top of the pinsetter, to drop into a rotating metal basket called the "pin turret", letting it slide into one of ten cells as the turret rotates – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin.  When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute in the center of the turret being filled last.  Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them through its full downward travel onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck. As the table lowers towards the pindeck to set the new rack of pins, it is visibly protected with its attached sheet metal "deck shield", visible to the bowler at any time the spotting table needs to either descend part-way to handle standing pins after the first ball, or to fully descend (once loaded from the pin-turret above it) to set the new rack of pins for the next frame.  The Model A/JetBack series pinsetters characteristically halt their operation, should the pin turret not yet be full of pins for the next frame, by pausing the sweep bar at the back of its rearwards travel and holding the table in its fully elevated position, until the pin-turret fills and releases its load into the spotting table's upper level.

This style of machine is typically loaded with 20 pins, though most proprietors normally put in 21 pins to facilitate quicker loading and faster operation of the pinsetter, especially in cases where the bowler(s) make two strikes in quick succession — on all the Model A-based unit designs, the "second ball cycle" used for both a second ball's delivery or a strike won't complete if the turret is not full, with the deck waiting in its elevated position as stated previously.  Adding an extra pin does not put undue stress on the machine, but adding more than that is not advisable due to damage that can occur to the machine.  Other centers will only load the pinsetter with 19 pins.  Having only 19 pins in the machine will cause fewer stops from time to time but it will slow down the progress of the game if multiple strikes are thrown in succession.

The later A2 and JetBack versions, otherwise each virtually identical to the original Model A design, were augmented enough to have much faster ball return action than the original Model A units.  the A-2 was also designed to be a faster machine overall to increase the number of frames that could be bowled in a given time frame, thus increasing the revenue of the bowling center.

The visible deck shield, as well as the noticeable sounds of pins entering the pin elevator (sounding like bowling pins rattling in a metal drum) and of the next set of pins dropping from the turret into the deck chutes, are unique to the Brunswick A series. There is a large Brunswick "crowned-B" (their 1950s logo) on the front of the deck shield of the Model A, "A-2" on the A-2 deck shield front, and "JetBack" on the JetBack deck shield front, unless these markings have been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Brunswick GS series pinsetters===
The GSX is [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick's]] current pinsetter. This machine uses a conveyor belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system similar to the ones utilized on the AMF 82 series pinspotters, while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts.  The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Stuff Works on Pinsetters|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/pinsetter2.htm|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original model in the GS series (GS stands for Game Setter) was the GS-10, which was principally designed by Augusti Schmid in Scherzenbach, Switzerland to promote the sport of bowling throughout Europe. In 1984, Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards Corporation acquired the rights to manufacture and sell the GS-10 pinsetter. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary. The electronic control system is manufactured in Michigan, near the Brunswick plant located in Muskegon, Michigan. Subsequent models (year of introduction is in parentheses):&lt;ref name="gshistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=GS-Series Pinsetter Operation and Service Manual, January 2001, Part number 47-902735-000|url=http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|publisher=Brunswick|accessdate=2014-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214238/http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*GS-92 (1991) – Incorporated changes to the pinsetter to make it quicker to install and easier to service.
*GS-96 (1995) – Incorporated changes in the software and hardware to speed up loading time of the pinsetter.
*GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new consolidated electronic system that uses a two control box system to reduce the number of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and user-friendly.
*GS-X (1999) – Incorporated a setting table and ball accelerator redesign that reduced the number of parts, the number of adjustments, and the amount of preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.&lt;ref name="gshistory"/&gt;

The GS is characterized by a sweep that rotates downward (as opposed to dropping) as soon as the ball enters the pin deck. A GS-X shows “gsx” on the sweep when it is down, unless this marking has been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Other types of ten-pin pinsetters===
The Mendes company produced a magnetic pinsetter known as the MM-2001.  It featured a flat magnetic pin table and magnets on the head of each pin.  It had a pit similar to the AMF and an elevator similar to the GSX.  Pin loading involves the combination of a carousel and magazine.  The company claimed this technology reduces stops in play due to table jams on out-of-range pins.  Mendes was bought out by Qubica, which sold the machine as the MAG3 until its partnership with AMF.

The now-defunct [[Bowl Mor]] firm of central Massachusetts (no relation to [[Bowlmor AMF]]) that was more famous for their candlepin pinsetters, also made tenpin pinspotters early in their history.  Some of these units are still in service, with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDNUsBFvyW4 at least one bowling center in Japan] having continued to use them, with some design features [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jii6U6fhAZc similar to the Brunswick Model A units] in appearance and function.

==Candlepin pinsetters==
The most common [[candlepin]] pinsetters were made by a Massachusetts company named Bowl-Mor (no relation to [[Bowlero Corporation|Bowlmor AMF]]), which was founded in the 1940s by two [[Lawyer|attorneys]], Howard Dowd and R. Lionel Barrows. According to the International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA), Dowd and Barrows were searching for business venture that could weather an [[economic depression]]. Marketing research on their part found that participant sports met this requirement, and that bowling was one of the top three participant sports at the time. The first Bowl-Mor pinsetters &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=DI9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Bowl-Mor&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Bowl-Mor&amp;f=false Patent for the Bowl-Mor candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt; were installed at the now-defunct [[Whalom Park]] amusement park in 1949. Though no longer manufactured, refurbished units, parts and maintenance support are available from several vendors.

Bowl-Mor pinsetters have a depressed pit approximately 14" long at the end of the bowling lane, placed about 4" below the level of the lane surface, with a curtain behind it, hanging past the lane surface but not touching the bottom of the pit. The curtain arrests the backwards motion of struck balls and pins, so that they fall onto the pit. When a reset takes place, a "board-like" sweep bar descends, driven by a chain drive system on each side of the machine along a pair of "L"-shaped tracks — one on either side, and sweeps the pins and balls off the lane, through the depressed area, and past the curtain and onto a [[rotating]] turntable. Here, pins and balls separate, being spun off the steadily rotating turntable by centrifugal force into the elevators.

An elevator composed of a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards the top of the machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical "ends" to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction.  The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms the main part of the spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, and release a set of pins, and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.

A separate elevator next to the turntable transports the balls to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen "dead wood" pins to ''remain'' on the lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for "spotting cells" in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by [[Roller chain|chains]] – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks on either side of the unit – or [[belt (mechanical)|belts]]. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate {{convert|1450|lb}}, and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.

AMF manufactured candlepin pinsetters for a short time in the 1960s, using a Bowl-Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHV1Me7RP8c at an unusually rapid pace] during its sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=kR1sAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2# Patent for the AMF candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless triggered into action by an automated scoring unit, candlepin pinsetters must be started by the bowler at the conclusion of a frame, by using a button or foot pedal operated switch to start the reset cycle.

==Five-pin pinsetters==
[[Five-pin bowling]] is a popular variation in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories:  string and free-fall.  String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached to the head of each pin, by means of a cord.  Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than an inch or two.  With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move.  There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered.  The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator.  The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.

Free-fall 5-pin pinsetters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iCe3hfheQI work in a similar way] to their ten-pin counterparts, and requires initiation by the bowler pressing a "reset" button as a candlepin unit does to "cycle" it, when a ball is bowled or pin knocked down.  When the player pushes their "Reset" button, the machine lowers a guard, lifts standing pins and sweeps away the downed pins.  If it does not recognize any standing pins, it will set up a new set for the next frame.  Unlike tenpin, balls and pins are picked up in the same elevator or conveyor and are separated at the top of the machine.

==Duckpin pinsetters==
[[Duckpin bowling]] is played in two varieties.

Regular duckpin bowling is popular in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States.  One popular pinspotter in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973. It has continuously moving conveyor belts at the ends of the gutters beside the pin deck as required by the sport's ruling body, the National Duckpin Bowling Congress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndbc.org/ NDBC's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; that move fallen pins to the pit.  The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical "kickback" panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins.  The pin table always handles the pins by the neck.  A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle.  When the magazine is loaded and the bowler is ready for a new set of pins, a lever pushes the magazine unit out to the pin table so it can take the pins out of the magazine and then set them down on the lane.

The Bowl-Mor company also made a duckpin pinspotter for a time, using a similar sweep device to its more famous candlepin machines.

Soft belly or rubberband duckpin is played in Quebec.  Most of these bowling centers use a string type pinsetter similar to five pin.  Apart from five-pin, rubber band duckpin is the only bowling variant that currently sanctions string type pinsetters.  The free-fall machine for this sport features a rotating turntable in the pit floor similar to a Bowl-Mor candlepin unit, conveyor belts in the gutters as required in the regular duckpin game in the US, an elevator similar to the Brunswick GSX, a turret similar to the A-2, and a rather flat looking pin table.  The sweep is similar to the candlepin Bowl-Mor.

==Off-spot pins==
Older table-based pinsetters that pick up the pins between throws could malfunction if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.

If a pin had drifted but still managed to be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than accurate gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during the pickup process.

Regular table-style fully automated tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings earlier in the 20th century, have been required by the [[United States Bowling Congress]] to be able to accurately re-spot "off-spot" pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location. If the pins are sufficiently out of position to not be pickable, the table will detect contact with the misplaced pin, and shut down the pinspotter to prevent mechanism damage.

String pinsetters generally do not have a mechanism to place pins back on the lane exactly where they were before, during the spare clearing.  Since there is no table, collision damage is not possible with a string pinsetter, but they can suffer from string entanglement when the pins are being picked up, that prevents pins from aligning with the pickup holes.

'''Product Architects Inc.''' is the parent company of Polar Bottle brand insulated sport water bottles and Half Twist lifestyle bottles.  The company is based out of [[Boulder, Colorado]] where it assembles and ships all of its products.

==History==
Robert Heiberger and Judy Amabile founded Product Architects Inc. in 1994.  The pair, along with their five employees, ran the company from the garage of their home&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; for a year before moving operations to an industrial park.  The business acquired its first national buyer in the form of [[The Container Store]] in April 1995&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; and entered the sporting goods market when they were picked up by [[Dick’s Sporting Goods]] later that year.&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt;   Since then, the company has enjoyed steady growth and was nominated as one of Colorado’s top small businesses in 2010 by ColoradoBiz Magazine.&lt;ref name="COBiz" /&gt;  Today, Product Architects Inc. sells its products in over 50 countries across six continents and employs 38 workers.

==Products==

===Polar Bottle===
[[File:Polar Bottle® Insulated Bottles.JPG|thumb|right|From left to right: The original Polar Bottle; the addition of a removable valve and screen-printed logo (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes); the bottle redesign; and modern bottles (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes).]]
The Polar Bottle was invented by Robert Heiberger, with prototypes being made as early as 1989.&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt;  Heiberger, a mechanical engineer working with heat loss in the medical technology design field, realized that the systems he employed to warm blood samples to body temperature could be used in reverse to keep liquid cool in a bottle.&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt;  The bottle features a dual-wall construction which creates a layer of insulating air between the liquid inside the bottle and the outside environment.  Between the two bottle layers is a thin foil liner that reflects solar energy away from the bottle.  The bottle is – and has always been&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; – made from [[Bisphenol A|BPA]]- and [[Phthalate]]-free [[Low-density polyethylene]].  It is produced in 24-ounce (710 ml) and 20-ounce (590 ml) sizes.  The bottles are [[Blow molding|blow-molded]] in [[Denver, CO]].&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; Since the Polar Bottle’s introduction, it has undergone continual improvements&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; to both form and function.  The first of these changes occurred in 1998 when a removable valve system was added to the cap to facilitate cleaning.  In 2006, the bottle’s entire aesthetic was updated with a sleeker body design, the addition of a carrying strap, and the introduction of a variety of colored liners.&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; In 2010, the company added 8 new graphic designs to their existing array of colored liners&lt;ref name="ODUSA" /&gt; and, in response to consumer feedback, reduced the thickness of the bottle walls to make squeezing the bottle easier.&lt;ref name="BWN" /&gt;

===Half Twist===
[[File:Polar Bottle® Half Twist™ Bottles.JPG|thumb|right|Half Twist bottles in Stainless Steel and plastic (HDPE) varieties]]
The Half Twist bottle was introduced in 2010 in an effort to expand the scope of Product Architects’ hydration options beyond the sports bottle market.&lt;ref name="OIA" /&gt;  The primary feature of the bottle is the Half Twist cap, which is fitted with a silicone gasket.  The lid allows the user to drink directly from the cap without removing it from the bottle and the gasket creates a watertight seal when closed.  The Half Twist received positive reviews,&lt;ref name="SLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FTH" /&gt; though some users found the lid difficult to operate.  The lid comes on two types of bottles: a 24-ounce (710 ml) [[High-density polyethylene]] bottle and a 28-ounce (828 ml) [[Stainless steel]] bottle.  Both bottle types are BPA- and Phthalate-free.

===Modern Wallet===
[[File:Modern Wallet.JPG|thumb|right|The “Wings” and “Prairie” Modern Wallet designs]]
Product Architects released the Modern Wallet in 2004.  The wallet was made of [[Teslin (material)|Teslin]], a synthetic material that is durable, flexible, breathable, and waterproof.  It featured a wide variety of pictures and designs that were shown on both the inside and outside of the wallet.  It was sold primarily to [[Independent Bicycle Dealers]], many of whom already carried the Polar Bottle.  The Modern Wallet was discontinued in 2008.

'''Shovelgloving''' is a form of [[physical exercise]] based around use of a [[sledgehammer]] that has been wrapped in a [[sweater]] or otherwise padded.  The shovelglove is used to perform shoveling, butter churning and wood chopping motions, amongst others. These natural movements are intended to be part of a [[functional training]] program.

Reinhard Engels, the inventor of Shovelgloving, advocates Shovelgloving for 14 minutes per day.

He explains the rationale for 14 minutes as follows:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.shovelglove.com Shovelglove: The Sledgehammer Workout&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"It's one minute less than the smallest unit of schedulistically significant time. No calendar has a finer granularity than 15 minutes. No one ever has a meeting that starts at 5 or 10 or 14 minutes before or after the hour. You have no excuse not to do this. Time-wise, it doesn't even register."''

He recommends beginners start with less than 14 minutes, however.

==Creation==
:''"I didn't want to do sit-ups or pushups. I didn't want to grovel on my stomach on the floor, like some degraded beast. "There must be some kind of movement I can do standing up, with the dignity of a human being," I thought, "some kind of movement that is natural and interesting, that my body would like to do."'' -'''Reinhard Engels''' &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Media coverage==
Reinhard Engels has been interviewed about Shovelgloving by the Healthy Planet Show&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthyplanetradio.com/Archived%20Shows.html&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast on [[WAIF|WAIF 88.3 FM]] in Cincinnati.

{{Companies law}}

'''Sociedad anónima deportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] in [[Spain]]. The new legal status was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/6SAD/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; to improve financial management and transparency in sports clubs. Many Spanish [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name, e.g. [[Atlético Madrid|Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D.]].

Every club which plays in [[Segunda División]] or [[Liga ACB]] and remains in the league is obliged to convert to S.A.D. status.

For historical reasons, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were allowed to retain their status as non-commercial sports associations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6142">'''Sports communication''' is an aspect of [[communication studies]] which specializes in the study of communication in a sports setting. It can encompass the study of interpersonal and organizational communication (both verbal and [[Non-verbal communication|non-verbal]]) between participants within a particular sport (e.g. players, coaches, managers, [[referees]], trainers and physiotherapists, and governing bodies); communication between sports participants, fans, and the media; and the way that sports are represented and communicated in the media. Sports communication is something that happens at all levels of ranging from kindergarten to the college level and is not restricted to professionals. It happens on a constant basis and works best with people that are willing to work collectively as a team. If everyone is on board with positive thoughts and communication, it becomes very dismantling to the person receiving the message. It is not only for positive talk, though, because negative sports communication happens all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Peddersen, Miloch, and Laucella (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal and Organizational Communication in Sport''' could involve intrapersonal, interpersonal, and small-group communication in sport, while organizational communication research could include intra- and interorganizational communication in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abeza|first=Gashaw|last2=O'Riley|first2=Norm|last3=Nadeau|first3=John|date=September 1, 2014|title=Sport Communication: A Multidimensional Assessment of the Field's Development|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=e08ba986-379f-495a-b76d-27f5ab6a4fe3@sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4110|journal=International Journal of Sport Communication|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports creates a context for positive communication and pro-social behaviors that often occur off of the field or court. For example, many athletes speak in public to children or act as motivational speakers. In tough situations, such as the aftermath of a natural disasters, well known athletes can lift the moral of an affected community.  Sports writer Lars Anderson wrote in his book ''The Storm and The Tide'' about how sports helped bring a town together after a disastrous tornado. Also, the situation and community coming together affected the college sports team at The University of Alabama. Andy Billings, professor at The University of Alabama, discusses how sports have the ability to start meaningful conversations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8R0bZzqfg. Sports communication theories allow for the prediction of many facets of communication such as gender, race, identity, culture, and politics.&lt;ref name="Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field"&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/communication-and-sport/book239698|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports communication varies vastly between individual sports and plays an important role in the success of teams and organizations. A good example of sports communication and its effects on players, organizations and media was the well-documented conflict involving two players for the Miami Dolphins. Inappropriate, discriminatory, and abusive interactions between [[Richie Incognito]] and Jonathan Martin lead to the release of Richie from the team, organizational issues, and an abundance of media coverage both negative and positive. Another example of sport communication is the recent "deflategate" scandal involving the New England Patriots apparently deflating the footballs during half-time of the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. Head coach [[Bill Belichick]] claims that any wrongdoing was done by the teams equipment manager and ball boy, and no communication had occurred between them two at any point in the game. This reflects sports communication because it is an example of a lack of communication between an inferior member of an organization and the head coach, which eventually led to a wide spread and highly publicized scandal which could've jeopardized the Patriots participation in the Super Bowl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

'''Periodization''' is the systematic planning of [[physical training|athletic or physical training]].&lt;ref name=Rowbottom&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowbottom|first=David J.|editor1-first=William E.|editor1-last=Garrett|editor2-first=Donald T.|editor2-last=Kirkendall|title=Periodization of Training|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683034219|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2013|chapter=Periodization of Training|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to reach the best possible performance in the most important competition of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (1973). Periodization or Peaking at the right time, in: Track Technique 54 (1973), pp.1720- 1724&lt;/ref&gt; It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period. Conditioning programs can use periodization to break up the training program into the off-season, preseason, inseason, and the postseason. Periodization divides the year round condition program into phases of training which focus on different goals.

==History==
The roots of periodization come from [[Hans Selye]]’s model, known as the [[General adaptation syndrome]]
The GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, and a decrease in system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage.  By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.

Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as "[[eustress]]" and detrimental stresses as "distress". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength-endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the "micro cycles" used at later times.

[[Russia]]n [[physiologist]] [[Leo Matveyev]] and Romanian sport scientist [[Tudor Bompa]] expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern  Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where [[Tudor Bompa]] developed the system further. In the 1968 it was used for the first time in the GDR and in 1972 in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. Nachwort zum neusten Stand der Literatur zur Periodisierung, in: L. P. MATWEJEW: Periodisierung des sportlichen Trainings. Berlin: Bartels &amp; Wernitz 1972, 201 - 231 (2. Aufl. 1978). Also basis for the French translation: Postface.La base de l'entraînement.Paris: Vigot 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union, periodization started to become modified. While Matveyev followed Pavlov{{which|date=May 2016}} and assumed that everybody should use the same periodization, individualised systems, using more and more biological data, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. PLATONOV: General theory of training of athletes in Olympic sports. Kiew: Olympic Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic training systems typically divide time up into three types of cycles: microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle. The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes.

==Theory of planning==
Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance.
It should consider the [[sportsperson|athlete]]’s potential, his/her performance in tests or [[competition]], and calendar of competition. It has to be simple, suggestive, and above all flexible as its content can be modified to meet the athletes rate of progress.

===The macrocycle===
A [[macrocycle]] is an annual plan that works towards peaking for the goal competition of the year. There are three phases in the macrocycle: preparation, competitive, and transition.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodisation in fencing|url=http://zfw-fencing.co.uk/articles/periodisation-fencing|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire preparation phase should be around 2/3 to 3/4 of the macrocycle. The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic base]] for an [[Endurance sports|endurance athlete]] such as running on a [[treadmill]] and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the [[Road surface|pavement]].

The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce [[anxiety]] before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition.

The transition phase is important for [[Psychology|psychological]] reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order. A typical [[wikt:weekend warrior|weekend warrior]] might take three months while a professional athlete might take as little as two weeks.

===The mesocycle===
A mesocycle represents a phase of training with a duration of between 2 – 6 weeks or microcycles, but this can depend on the sporting discipline.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt; A mesocycle can also be defined as a number of continuous weeks where the training program emphasize the same type of physical adaptations, for example muscle mass and anaerobic capacity. During the preparatory phase, a mesocycle commonly consists of 4 – 6 micro-cycles, while during the competitive phase it will usually consist of 2 – 4 micro-cycles depending on the competition’s [[calendar]].

The goal of the plan is to fit the mesocycles into the overall plan timeline-wise to make each mesocycle end on one of the phases and then to determine the [[workload]] and type of work of each cycle based on where in the overall plan the given mesocycle falls. The goal in mind is to make sure the body peaks for the high priority competitions by improving each cycle along the way.

===The microcycle===
A microcycle is typically a week because of the difficulty in developing a training plan that does not align itself with the weekly calendar. Each microcycle is planned based on where it is in the overall macrocycle.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt;

A micro-cycle is also defined as a number of training sessions, built around a given combination of acute program variables, which include progression as well as alternating effort (heavy vs. light days). The length of the micro-cycle should correspond to the number of workouts - empirically often 4-16 workouts - it takes for the athlete or fitness client to adapt to the training program. When the athlete or fitness client has adapted to the program and no longer makes progress, a change to one or more program variables should be made.

==The annual plan==
The annual plan is important in that it directs and guides performance training over a year. It is based on the concept of [[periodization]] and the principles of training. The objective of training is to reach a high level of performance (peak performance) and an athlete has to develop skills, biomotor abilities and psychological traits in a methodical manner.

===Preparatory phase===
This phase consists of the general preparation and specific preparation. Usually which can be subdivided into three different phases. One should always remember that this is a base creation phase with the objective to attain the previous training state, and the longest period of periodization must be devoted towards the preparatory period.
The performance depends on preparatory period, and is divided into '''three''' phases:

'''Phase  I)''' To regain previous training 
*Low volume, but maintaining high intensity is there.
*competitions.

'''Phase II)''' Low training volume &amp; High training load to develop the factors needed for performance.
*works on specific exercise. 
'''Phase III)''' Decrease in the intensity of load and increase in tactical training and aim at improving tactical under competition condition.
{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Competitive phase===
This phase may contain a few main competitions each containing a pre-competitive and a main competition. Within the main competition, an uploading phase and a special preparatory phase may be included. This also includes hypertropthy

===Transition phase===
This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain an acceptable level of general physical preparation. This phase lasts 3–4 weeks (perhaps longer) but should not exceed five weeks under normal conditions and may be sports specific. It allows the body to fully regenerate so that it is prepared for the next discipline.
*there is no competition in this phase.

===Opposition to Periodization===
A review published in the journal 'sports medicine' in 2017 has questioned the validity of the use of traditional models of periodization in sport. This is largely due to the over simplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psyco-biological effects of various training methods used in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0823-y| pmid=29189930| pmc=5856877|title = Periodization Theory: Confronting an Inconvenient Truth| journal=Sports Medicine| volume=48| issue=4| pages=753–764|year = 2018|last1 = Kiely|first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical Periodization ==

For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalhal, C. (2014). ‘Soccer: Developing A Know-how’,  Prime Books&lt;/ref&gt; Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the ‘science of periodization’. However, Kiely,&lt;ref&gt;Kiely, J. (2010). ‘Periodization, planning, prediction: And why the future ain’t what it used to be!’, UKA, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only ‘compared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation’  but did not offer any insight ‘into how that variation is best scheduled and organised’ (Kiely, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is ‘little or no supporting evidence’ which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous.

Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, &amp; Marque,&lt;ref&gt;Garganta, J., Maia, J. &amp; Marques, A. (1996). ‘Acerca da investigação dos factores de rendimento em futebol’, Revista paulista de educação física, São Paulo, 10, (2), 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliviera,&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, G.J. (1991). ‘Especificidade, o pós-futebol do pré-futebol. Um factor condicionante do alto rendimento desportivo. In Oliveira, R. (2014) ‘Tactical periodization: The secrets of soccer most effective training methodology’.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelo,&lt;ref&gt;Castelo, J. (2000). ‘Formação continua. O treinador de futebol. Exercícios de treino no futebol’, Escola superior de desporto de Rio Maior. IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaiteiro &lt;ref&gt;Gaiteiro, B. (2006). ‘A cienca oculta do sucesso! Mourinho aos olhos da cienca’. In Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’ Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit,&lt;ref&gt;Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’  Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical, technical and mental aspects required for positive performances.  This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important.

[[File:Squats.svg|right|thumb|400px|The parallel back squat]]
In [[strength training]] and fitness, the '''squat''' is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily the [[muscle]]s of the [[thigh]]s, [[hip]]s and [[gluteal muscles|buttocks]], [[quadriceps femoris muscle]] ([[Vastus lateralis muscle|vastus lateralis]], [[vastus medialis]], [[vastus intermedius muscle|vastus intermedius]] and [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]]), [[hamstring]]s, as well as strengthening the [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s and insertion of the [[tendon]]s throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of the legs as well as developing [[core stability|core strength]]. Squats are typically used to hone back, thigh, and hip stability.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt; [[Isometric exercise|Isometrically]], the [[human back|lower back]], the upper back, the [[rectus abdominis muscle|abdominals]], the trunk muscles, the costal muscles, and the [[shoulder]]s and arms are all essential to the exercise and thus are trained when squatting with the proper form.&lt;ref name="Starting Strength"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mark Rippetoe|last=Rippetoe|first=Mark | name-list-format = vanc |title=Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, p.8|year=2007|publisher=The Aasgaard Company|isbn=0-9768054-2-1|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of [[powerlifting]], together with [[deadlift]]s and [[bench press]]. It is also considered a staple in many popular recreational exercise programs.

When people discuss volume, the equation is sets performed times number of repetitions times external weight.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shoepe|first=Todd | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=Volume Estimations for Combined Free-Weight and Rubber-Band Resistance Exercise|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=126785397&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Kinesiology|volume=49.2|pages=169–177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding resistance to squats has been shown to affect the power and speed of the exercise.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loturco I, Pereira LA, Moraes JE, Kitamura K, Cal Abad CC, Kobal R, Nakamura FY | title = Jump-Squat and Half-Squat Exercises: Selective Influences on Speed-Power Performance of Elite Rugby Sevens Players | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170627 | date = 2017-01-23 | pmid = 28114431 | pmc = 5256944 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170627 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though free-weight numbers fit nicely into the volume equation, adding resistance can complicate the equation and make volume less easy to calculate.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; More specifically, people have found that they can increase resistance while exercising by utilizing chains or rubber bands.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; One study discovered that the physical demand of exercises with resistance increases in a linear relationship with intensity.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reis VM, Garrido ND, Vianna J, Sousa AC, Alves JV, Marques MC | title = Energy cost of isolated resistance exercises across low- to high-intensities | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = e0181311 | date = 2017-07-24 | pmid = 28742112 | pmc = 5524349 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0181311 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in energy expenditure during squatting can be attributed to the various forms of movements, intensities, weights, repetitions, and types of items (Smith machine or barbell).&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

For example, knees can be placed in knees in, knees out, and knees over toes; whereas squats can be performed at roughly 20°, 50°, and 80°.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The parallel squat is more preferred than the deep squat because the potential of injury on the cruciate and menisci ligaments is higher in the latter.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Muscles engaged==
;Primary muscles:
[[Gluteus maximus]] (glutes), [[quadriceps]] (quads)&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/135/bodyweight-squat |title=Bodyweight Squat |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |access-date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Squat.png|upright|thumb|A [[deep squat]]]]
The movement begins from a standing position. Weight is often added; typically in the form of a loaded barbell but [[dumbbell|dumbbells]] and [[kettlebell|kettlebells]] may also be used. When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle (a high bar squat) or held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids (a low bar squat).&lt;ref name = Brown2000&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to exercise science | first = SP | last = Brown | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | publisher = Lippincott Wims &amp; Wilkins| isbn = 0-683-30280-9 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cThxFwYl3ZoC&amp;pg=PA280 280–1] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.

Squats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Technical_Rules/2013_Technical_Rules_english.pdf Technical Rules Book 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319094920/http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Technical_Rules/2013_Technical_Rules_english.pdf |date=19 March 2013 }}.

''Bigger Faster Stronger'', March/April 2008, pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatting below parallel qualifies a squat as deep while squatting above it qualifies as shallow.&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt; Some authorities caution against [[deep squat]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellis E, Arambatzi F, Papadopoulos C | title = Effects of load on ground reaction force and lower limb kinematics during concentric squats | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1045–55 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16194981 | doi = 10.1080/02640410400022094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the forces on the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] and [[Posterior cruciate ligament|PCL]] decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the [[meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]] and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, HM, and Gilewich, GB (1999) ''Musculoskeletal Assessment: Joint Range Of Motion And Manual Muscle Strength''. Baltimore, MD: Williams and Wilkins, p. 374, {{ISBN|0683303848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.

As the body gradually descends, the hips and knees undergo [[flexion]], the ankle extends ("[[dorsiflexion|dorsiflexes]]") and muscles around the joint contract [[Eccentric contraction|eccentrically]], reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles [[Concentric contraction|concentrically]], and the hips and knees undergo [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] while the ankle [[Plantarflexion|plantarflexes]].&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt;

Two common errors include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a [[spinal disc herniation]].&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt;

Another error where health of the knee joint is concerned is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes. If the knee is not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. The knee should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track the knee properly.

===Common Errors===
Some common squat posture mistakes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squat|url=http://www.lift.net/exercises/how-to-squat-with-proper-form/|work=lift.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Eirik | last = Sandvik | name-list-format = vanc |title=The 11 Worst Squat Mistakes | url = https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-11-worst-squat-mistakes|website=T NATION|access-date=7 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heels off floor: Raising the heels compromises balance and reduces the contribution of the gluteus and hamstring muscles.
* Knees not in line with toes: If the knees are not in line with the toes it means they have entered a [[valgus position]], which adversely stresses the knee joint.
* Poor foot placement: Placing the feet in an compensatory or asymmetric position can lead to structural problems in the movement.
* Allowing the back to round.

==Equipment==
Various types of equipment can be used to perform squats.

A [[power cage]] can be used to reduce risk of injury and eliminate the need for a [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] partner. By putting the bar on a track, the [[Smith machine]] reduces the role of hip movement in the squat and in this sense resembles a [[leg press]].&lt;ref name = SST121&gt;[[#SST|Cornacchia]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA121 121], [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA125 125].&lt;/ref&gt; The '''monolift''' rack allows an athlete to perform a squat without having to take a couple of steps back with weight on as opposed to conventional racks. Not many powerlifting federations allow monolift in competitions (WPO, GPC, IPO).

Other equipment used can include a [[weight lifting belt]] to support the torso and boards to wedge beneath the [[ankle]]s to improve stability and allow a deeper squat ([[Olympic weightlifting#Equipment|weightlifting shoes]] also have wooden wedges built into the sole to achieve the same effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9963-616-03-8 | title = The Insider's Tell-All Handbook on Weight-Lifting Technique | vauthors = McRobert S | publisher = CS Publishing | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve.

==World records==

==Variants==
The squat has a number of variants, some of which can be combined:

===Barbell===
[[File:Front-squat-1-857x1024.png|thumb|left|upright|Starting position of a front squat, using the "California" or cross-armed grip.]]
[[File:Zecher-squats-1.gif|thumb|upright|Zercher squat]]
[[File:The Hack Squat George Hackenschmidt.jpg|thumb|right|The Hack squat as pictured page 70 of George Hackenschmidt's book "The Way to Live" (1908)]]
*'''Back squat''' – the bar is held on the back of the body upon the upper trapezius muscle, near to the base of the neck. Alternatively, it may be held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids. In [[powerlifting]] the barbell is often held in a lower position in order to create a lever advantage, while in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] it is often held in a higher position which produces a posture closer to that of the [[clean and jerk]]. These variations are called '''low bar''' (or '''powerlifting squat''') and '''high bar''' (or '''olympic squat'''), respectively.
**'''Sumo squat ''' – the barbell is rested on the shoulders in the usual squat position. The legs should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart and the feet should be pointed outwards. when squatting, you should feel a stretch on the adductor longues and adductor magnus muscles which are found on the inner thigh.
**'''Box squat''' – at the bottom of the motion the squatter will sit down on a bench or other type of support then rise again. The box squat is commonly utilized by power lifters to train the squat.  Pausing on the box creates additional stimulus in the hips and glutes. Some people believe this form of isometric training allows for greater gains in the squat compared to a traditional Olympic style squat, while others contend that the increased spinal loading creates more opportunity for injury.
*'''Front squat''' – the weight (usually a barbell) is held in front of the body across the [[clavicle]]s and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]s in either a [[Clean and jerk|clean]] grip, as is used in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], or with the arms crossed and hands placed on top of the barbell.
*'''Hack squat''' – the barbell is held in the hands just behind the legs; this exercise was first known as Hacke (heel) in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = George | last = Hackenschmidt | title = The Way To Live in Health and Physical Fitness | location = York | year = 1908 | page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to European strength sports expert and Germanist Emmanuel Legeard this name was derived from the original form of the exercise where the heels were joined. The hack squat was thus a squat performed the way Prussian soldiers used to click their heels ("Hacken zusammen").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Fondamentaux|last = Emmanuel|first = Legeard | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = |year = 2008|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hack squat was popularized in the [[English-speaking countries]] by early 1900s wrestler [[George Hackenschmidt]]. It is also called a "'''rear [[deadlift]]'''".
*'''Overhead squat''' – the barbell is held overhead in a wide-arm [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]] grip; however, it is also possible to use a closer grip if balance allows.
*'''Zercher squat''' – the barbell is held in the crooks of the arms, on the inside of the elbow. One method of performing this is to [[deadlift]] the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position the crook of your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed. Named after Ed Zercher, a 1930s [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]].
*'''Deep knee bend on toes''' - similar to a normal back squat only the lifter is positioned on their forefeet and toes, with their heels raised, throughout the repetition. Usually, the weight used is not more than moderate in comparison to a flat footed, heavy back squat.
*'''Loaded squat jump''' - the barbell is positioned similarly to a back squat. The exerciser squats down, before moving upwards into a jump, and then landing in approximately the same position. The loaded squat jump is a form of [[Plyometrics#Loaded plyometrics|loaded plyometric]] exercise used to increase explosive power. Variations of this exercise may involve the use of a trap bar or dumbbells.

===Lunge===
*'''Split squat''' – an assisted one-legged squat where the non-lifting leg is rested on the ground a few 'steps' behind the lifter, as if it were a static [[Lunge (exercise)|lunge]].
*'''Bulgarian squat''' – performed much like a split squat, but the foot of the non-lifting leg is rested on a knee-high platform behind the lifter.

===Other===
*'''Belt squat''' – is an exercise performed the same as other squat variations except the weight is attached to a hip belt i.e. a [[dip belt]]
*'''Goblet squat''' – a squat performed while holding a [[kettlebell]] next to one's chest and abdomen with both hands.
*'''Sissy squat''' – a squat with several sorts (dumbbell, weight plate, [[Smith machine]], barbell, bodyweight). In the most common  variant, a dumbbell is held behind the legs while the heels are lifted off the ground and the torso remains flat while the lifter leans backwards; sometimes done with a plate held on the chest and one arm holding onto a chair or beam for support. Unlike most other squat variations, [[Vince Gironda]] promoted sissy squat as a [[rectus femoris]] isolation exercise.
*'''Smith squat''' – a squat using a Smith machine. Hack squats can be done easily this way, as in the picture. A Smith squat is often considered inferior to the free-weight variant because of the lack of recruitment of auxiliary muscles and limited range of movement.
*'''Trap bar squat''' – a [[trap bar]] is held with hands at the sides. This movement is more correctly called a lift.

===Bodyweight===
[[File:Kniebeuge.jpg|thumb|left|Bodyweight squat]]
*'''Bodyweight squat''' – done with no weight or barbell, often at higher repetitions than other variants.
*'''Overhead squat''' – a non-weight bearing variation of the squat exercise, with the hands facing each other overhead, biceps aligned with the ears, and feet hip-width apart. This exercise is a predictor of total-body flexibility, mobility, and possible lower body dysfunction.
*'''Face the wall squat''' – performed with or without weights. It is primarily to strengthen the vertebrae tissues.{{vague|date=October 2014}} In the Chinese variant (面壁蹲墙) weights are not used. Toes, knees and nose line up almost touching the wall. Advanced forms include shoeless, wrists crossed behind the back, and fists in front of forehead, all performed with toes and knees closed and touching the wall.
[[File:Squat, baithak, Hindu squat, possibly 'The Great Gamma'.png|thumb|A photo of an Indian wrestler performing baithaks (Hindu squats).]]
*'''Hindu squat''' – also called a baithak, or a deep knee bend on toes. It is performed without weight, with the heels raised, and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes; during the movement, the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It develops strength, endurance and flexibility throughout the legs, calves, lower back and thighs. To perform a baithak, the exerciser stands on their forefeet with their hands by their sides. They bend their legs and squat down. They then stand up again. There is only a relatively small movement of the arms.
*'''Hindu Jumper Squat''' – Done without weight. Similar to Hindu squat, but a bounce / light forward or backward jump of about six inches is added before and after each rep. Then land in a squat with heels elevated. Then jump back to the starting position. Repeat as many times as you can.
*'''Jump squat''' – a [[plyometrics]] exercise where the squatter engages in a rapid eccentric contraction and jumps forcefully off the floor at the top of the range of motion.
*'''Pistol''' – a bodyweight single leg squat done to full depth, while the other leg is extended off the floor. Sometimes dumbbells, kettlebells or [[medicine balls]] are added for resistance.
*'''Shrimp squat''' – also called the ''flamingo squat'', a version of the pistols squat where instead of extending the non-working leg out in front, it is bent and placed behind the working leg while squatting, perhaps held behind in a hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/ Periodic Table of Bodyweight Exercises with Clickable Videos]. Strength.stack52.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pistol squat.jpg|thumb|right|Medicine ball pistol squat]]
*'''Monkey F*****''' – In American military training, this type of squat is used to warm up before a session of physical exercise. It is performed by the person standing with feet at distance of shoulder length. In a bent position and the arms goes between the legs, and around to the outside of the ankles and grab the back of the ankle. During this exercise the hips are lowered repeatedly, and the appearance of this exercise lead to its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ltugAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;lpg=PT25&amp;dq=monkey+fucker+exercise&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YuzN5Dq7g&amp;sig=mQiyxkJLvIQzqjoO0fHpnRAALnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjijKyi35DdAhWHL48KHRchDZE4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=monkey+fucker+exercise&amp;f=false|title=Combat and Other Shenanigans: A Humorous Memoir from the Iraq War|first=Piers|last=Platt|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Piers Platt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injury considerations==
Although the squat has long been a basic element of weight training, it has in recent years been the subject of considerable controversy.  Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar spine]] and [[knee]]s.&lt;ref name = SST120&gt;[[#SST|Cornacchia]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA120 120].&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, continue to advocate the squat as one of the best exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that [[incomplete squat]]s (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more likely to cause injury&lt;ref name="Starting Strength"/&gt; than a [[full squat]] (terminating with hips at or below knee level). A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartmann H, Wirth K, Klusemann M | title = Analysis of the load on the knee joint and vertebral column with changes in squatting depth and weight load | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 993–1008 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23821469 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0073-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squats Used in Physical Therapy===
[[File:Kirk-karwoski-squat.jpg|thumb|Man completing a heavy squat exercise. ]]

Squats can be used for some rehabilitative activities because they hone stability without excessive compression on the tibiofemoral joint and anterior cruciate ligament.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaberzadeh S, Yeo D, Zoghi M | title = The Effect of Altering Knee Position and Squat Depth on VMO : VL EMG Ratio During Squat Exercises | journal = Physiotherapy Research International | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 164–73 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 25962352 | doi = 10.1002/pri.1631 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that deeper squats are associated with higher compressive loads on patellofemoral joint.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; As a result, it is possible that people who suffer from pain in the patellofemoral joint cannot squat at increased depths. For some knee rehabilitation activities, patients might feel more comfortable with knee flexion between 0 and 50° because it places less force compared to deeper depths.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Another study shows that decline squats at angles higher than 16° may not be beneficial for the knee and fails to decrease calf tension.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Other studies have indicated that the best squat to hone quadriceps without inflaming the patellofemoral joint occurs between 0–50°.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Combining single-limb squats and decline angles have been used to rehabilitate knee extensors.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jim | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=A Biomechanical Investigation of a Single-Limb Squat: Implications for Lower Extremity Rehabilitation Exercise.|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=34918982&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=43|pages=477–482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting squats at a declined angle allows the knee to flex despite possible pain or lack of mobilization in the ankle.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; If therapists are looking to focus on the knee during squats, one study shows that doing single-limb squats at a 16° decline angle has the greatest activation of the knee extensors without placing excessive pressure on the ankles.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This same study also found that a 24° decline angle can be used to strengthen ankles and knee extensors.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division at the end of the [[2007 Major League Baseball season]].]]
'''Standings''' or '''rankings''' are listings which compare sports teams or individuals, institutions, nations, companies, or other entities by [[rankings|ranking]] them in order of ability or achievement. A table or chart (such as a league table, a ladder or a leaderboard) may be employed to display such listings. A league table may list several related statistics, but they are generally sorted by the primary one that determines the rankings. Many industries and institutions may compete in league tables in order to help bring in new customers and clients. Those tables ranking sports teams are generally used to help determine who may advance to the [[playoffs]] or another [[tournament]], who is [[Promotion and relegation|promoted or relegated]], or who gets a higher [[Draft (sports)|draft pick]].

==Sport==
{{main|Group tournament ranking system}}
In sport, '''league tables''' group teams of similar abilities in a chart to show the current standing of the participants (teams or individuals) in a sports [[List of professional sports leagues|league]] or competition. These lists are generally published in newspapers and other media, as well as the official web sites of the sports leagues and competitions.

At the very least, a league table will show the names of the teams and their points total or [[winning percentage]] (depending on the sport), sorted in order of points or percentage. However, many league tables show further statistics; these may include:
* wins
* losses
* [[tie (draw)|ties]] (draws)
* [[goal differential]] (Goals scored minus goals conceded)
** goals scored
** goals allowed (conceded)
* home/away win/loss records

Usually, if a league is divided into conferences and divisions, the league table will also be. Often, a less specific table is also included. For example, [[National Hockey League]] tables will normally have a detailed table for each division, plus a table for each conference showing just the points totals.

As an example, below is the league table for the [[Northeast Division (NHL)|Northeast Division]] of the National Hockey League, as of March 31, 2004:
 Team         GP   W   L   T  OL   GF   GA  Pts
 x-Boston     79  40  18  14   7  201  179  101
 x-Toronto    80  43  24  10   3  234  204   99
 x-Ottawa     79  41  22  10   6  254  178   98
 x-Montreal   79  40  28   7   4  201  182   91
 Buffalo      79  36  32   7   4  213  210   83
 
 x - clinched playoff spot
 y - clinched division championship

In the above table, an "'''x'''" placed before a team's name shows that the team has qualified for playoff position; other letters may be used to show that a team is guaranteed first place, has been eliminated from contention and so forth. From this table, we can see that [[Boston Bruins|Boston]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto]], [[Ottawa Senators|Ottawa]] and [[Montreal Canadiens|Montreal]] are all guaranteed playoff positions; the absence of a "'''y'''" shows that the division championship is still to play for. Meanwhile, because [[Buffalo Sabres|Buffalo]] has no symbol at all, they are not out of playoff contention, but have yet to clinch a playoff position. The following day, a new league table would appear in newspapers, updated based on the previous night's games. Of course, the above table would also be accompanied by those of the other divisions in the league.

==Education==
League tables are used to compare the academic achievements of different institutions. [[College and university rankings]] order institutions in higher education by combinations of factors. In addition to entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools are ranked. These rankings usually are conducted by magazines, newspapers, governments and academics. For example, [[league tables of British universities]] are published annually by ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. The primary aim of these rankings is to inform potential applicants about British universities based on a range of criteria. Similarly, in countries like India, league tables are being developed and a popular magazine, Education World, published them based on data from ''TheLearningPoint.net''. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

It is complained that the ranking of England's schools to rigid guidelines that fail to take into account wider social conditions actually makes failing schools even worse. This is because the most involved parents will then avoid such schools, leaving only the children of non-ambitious parents to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
In business, league tables list the leaders in [[investment banking]] activity, enabling people to quickly analyze financial data. Companies which collect this kind of data include [[Dealogic]], [https://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg L.P.] and [[Thomson Reuters]]. The [[Thomson Reuters league tables]] list the top financiers in a particular industry. Dealogic's league tables are rankings of investment banks in terms of the dollar volume of deals that investment banks work on. [https://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg's] league tables provide an overview of top underwriters and legal advisers to securities deals, as well as fees netted from these transactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5807">[[Image:Tabletennis.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Table tennis racqet]]
A basic '''table tennis racqet''' (also known as a "[[bat-and-ball games|paddle]]" or "bat") is used by [[table tennis]] players. The table tennis racket is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip.  Unlike a conventional "[[Racqet_(sports_equipment)|racqet]]", it does not include strings strung across an open frame. The USA generally uses the term "paddle" while Europeans and Asians use the term "bat" and the official ITTF term is "racket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ITTF |date=August 2018 |accessdate=16 November 2018 |title=The International Table Tennis Federation Handbook 2018 |url=https://d3mjm6zw6cr45s.cloudfront.net/2018/02/2018ITTFHandbook_v2.pdf_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Table tennis regulations approved by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF) allow different surfaces on each side of the paddle for various amounts of spin (including nullifying it) or speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varenberg|first1=M.|last2=Varenberg|first2=A.|date=2012|title=Table tennis rubber: Tribological characterization|journal=Tribology Letters|volume=47|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a player may have a spin-heavy rubber on one side of his paddle, and no spin on the other side. The player can flip the racket in play for different types of returns. To help a player distinguish between different types of rubber used by his opponent, regulations specify that one side of a paddle must be red while the other must be black, allowing a player to see what side of a paddle hits the ball mid-play. The player has the right to inspect his opponent's racquet before a match to see the type and color. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the paddle cannot be exchanged for another at any time during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ping Pong Paddle|url=https://bestreviewshunt.com/best-ping-pong-paddle/|publisher=Bestreviewshunt.com|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rubber coating may be of pimpled rubber, with the pimples outward, or it may be composed of a sponge layer, covered by rubber that may have the pimples pointed inwards or outwards.  Some paddles are not covered with rubber ("naked") to make it spin resistant. However, it is illegal to use these types of racquet in competition as they are not approved by the ITTF. Some types of rubbers are also not approved. Approved rubbers have the ITTF emblem on the base of the rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table tennis|url=http://www.sizes.com/sports/table_tennis.htm#website|website=www.sizes.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembling ==
;Choices
Players have many choices and variations in rubber sheets on their racquet. Although a racquet may be purchased assembled with rubber by the manufacturer, most serious tournament players will use a custom racquet. A player selects a blank blade (i.e., a racquet without rubber) based on his or her playing style. The type of wood or synthetic layers used to make up the blade will determine the blade's speed. The different types of rubber sheets affect the level of spin, speed, and other specific playing characteristics. Racquet construction and new rubber technology contribute significantly to the amount of deviation from the expected ball flight path.

==Glue and gluing==
Normally, a sheet of rubber is glued to a blade using various table tennis brand glues such as Butterfly, Donic, and DHS. Some glues may work even if it wasn't designed specifically for table tennis, such as Rubber Cement and Tear Mender. The rubber is not removed until it wears out or becomes damaged. In the 1980s, some players developed a new technique with a special glue called [[speed glue]] to apply the rubber every time he played. The glue would help provide more spin and speed by providing a "[[catapult]]" effect. 

The fairly recent development of speed glue speeds up the departure of the ball from the rubber considerably, though at the cost of some ball control on [[touch shot]]s &lt;!-- Note: This seems to be a table tennis term, so please don't change it to "tough" which is what I thought it should be until I Googled the term. --&gt; where little or no spin is put on the ball.  Speed glue was allowed for the last time in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. From the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] onward, the Olympic games banned speed glue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm  ITTF Bans Speed Glue, Boosters and Tuners - and Much More!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105148/http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm |date=2015-04-02 }} By Greg Letts, About.com. Accessed September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintaining and protection ==
The surface of a racquet will develop a smooth glossy [[patina]] with use. The rubber surface needs regular cleaning to retain a high friction surface for ball spin. Commercial cleaners or water and soap can be cleaning agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.megaspin.net/info/equip.asp|title= Table Tennis Information - Equipment maintenance|accessdate=2007-07-10 |last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Megaspin |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun exposure may damage the rubber.

'''Tangolates''' (also known in Buenos Aires as '''Tango-Pilates''' and '''Pilates-Tango'''), involves body exercises that draw on  characteristics from [[Tango (dance)|Tango dancing]] and [[Pilates]]. It utilizes a partner method rather than individual exercises and incorporates aerobic and cardio elements. Tangolates is usually performed on a specially designed apparatus, on a mat, or on a Pilates apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/life-style/tango-pilates-tangolates/|title=The Argentina Independent|website=Argentinaindependent.com|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.it/salute/benessere/news/a847845/tangolates/|title=Tangolates|date=9 November 2012|website=Elle.it|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tangolates originated in 2004 in a public hospital for patients with motor disorders.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In order to help patients with their workouts, each one was coupled with an instructor in partner exercises.  

==Research==
In order to assess the effects of these exercises on patients, a preliminary test of efficacy was conducted at the Tamara Di Tella’s Pilates Room. The results of this research were presented at the 10th International Congress of Internal Medicine, held on 24-27 August 2004, in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uba.ar/comunicacion/p_electronicas/uu/anteriores/septiembre04/notas/02a.php] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients were convoked for 325 sessions, over a period of three months. Afterwards, patients asserted that the exercises helped them “not only to move better but also to feel better”. Their evaluations led to the conclusion that Tangolates partner exercises help patients improve, not only their movement but also their quality of life.

According to Di Tella, the fact that Tangolates requires a rapport between two people is a very interesting subject of research. Partner work may help stimulate the brain and could become an alternate pathway to successful movement. “It is that internal ignition that may just work for some brain disorder patients”, says Di Tella. Indeed, Tango’s strong and focused beat and the fact that it is done in close coordination with a partner is an excellent stimulus to initiate movement. “Tango stimulates cooperation and creates bond like no other dance, and this is an extraordinary motivator for some patients”, says Di Tella.

==Principles==
Tangolates combines the coordination and core stability that is inherent to Pilates with the cardio or aerobic element of Tango.

In sports, a '''winning percentage''' is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of games or matches a team or individual has won. It is defined as wins divided by the total number of matches played (i.e. wins plus draws plus losses). A draw counts as a ½ win.

For example, if a team's season record is 30 wins and 20 losses, the winning percentage would be .600. If a team's season record is 30–15–5 (i.e. it has won thirty games, lost fifteen and tied five times), the five tie games are counted as 2½ wins, and so the team has an adjusted record of 32½ wins, resulting in a {{winpct|30|15|5}} winning percentage for the fifty total games from

: &lt;math&gt;\text{winning percentage} = {\text{wins}+0.5\cdot\text{ties}\over\text{total games}}\cdot100\%&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;65\% = {32.5\over50}\cdot100\%&lt;/math&gt;

Winning percentage is one way to compare the record of two teams; however, another standard method most frequently used in [[baseball]] and professional [[basketball]] standings is [[games behind]]. In [[baseball]], a [[pitcher]] is assessed wins and losses as an individual [[statistic]] and thus has his own winning percentage, based on his [[win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]].

In North America, winning percentages are expressed to three digits and read as whole numbers (e.g. 1.000, "a thousand" or .500, "five hundred"). In this case, the name "winning ''percentage''" is actually a misnomer, since it is not expressed as a [[percentage]]. A winning percentage such as .536 ("five thirty-six") expressed as a percentage would be 53.6%.{{anchor|500}}

However, in [[soccer]], a [[manager (football)|manager]]'s abilities may be measured by win percentage. In this case, the formula is wins divided by total number of matches; draws are not considered as "half-wins", and the quotient is always in percentage form.

In the [[National Football League]], division winners and playoff qualifiers are technically determined by winning percentage and not by number of wins. Ties are currently counted as half a win and half a loss, however, prior to 1972 ties did not count for the purposes of this calculation. So, for example, one team finished 11-3 and another 10-2-2, there would have been no tiebreaker - the team with two ties would have been deemed the outright division winner. This made tie games (a fairly common occurrence in football before [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] was introduced) somewhat more valuable to teams compared to the half-win they are considered today. 

Some leagues and competitions may instead use a [[points percentage]] system, changing the nature of this statistic. In this type of method, used in many [[group tournament ranking system]]s, the competitors are awarded a certain number of points per win, fewer points per tie, and none for a loss. The teams are then ranked by the total number of these accumulated points. One such method is the "[[three points for a win]]", where three points are awarded for winning a game, one point is awarded for a draw, and no points are awarded for a loss. The [[National Hockey League]] (which uses an [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime and shootout]]s to break all ties) awards two points for a win in regulation or overtime/shootout, one point for an overtime loss, and none for a regulation loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Career Leaders and Records for Points Percentage (Goalie) |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_pct_goalie_career.html |publisher= Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate= 24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2008–2009&amp;nbsp;– REGULAR SEASON&amp;nbsp;– SUMMARY&amp;nbsp;– POINT PERCENTAGE |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/teamstats.htm?fetchKey=20092ALLAAAAll&amp;sort=pointPctg&amp;viewName=summary |publisher= NHL.com |accessdate= 24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Sports Values Summit for Peace''' is an international conference which is aimed at  pursuing the value of the [[sports]] and discussing and disseminating how supports can be socially contribute to [[peace]] and respect for [[human rights]].

== History ==
The first World Sports Values [[Summit]] for Peace was held in [[London]] under the theme of “Olympic Values: London and Beyond”  from  June 29 through July 1, 2012.  The event highlighted the three overarching themes discussed at the two-day [[symposium]]: the meaning of Olympic values in the twenty-first century; how to realize them more effectively in sport, at the Games and beyond;  and how to leverage them for broader goals, nationally and internationally, including human right and peace. Related to the first Summit, a global essay contest  was also held, in which 265 students from 61 countries shared their ideas about Olympic values and how to realize them through sport, culture, education, and other public initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/olympic-values-london-and-beyond-report-of-the-olympic-values-symposium |title="Olympic Values: London and Beyond" Report of the Olympic Values Symposium |date=July 1, 2012 |website=Berkley Center For Religion, Peace World |publisher=BERKLEY CENTER FOR RELIGION, PEACE &amp; WORLD AFFAIRS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY |access-date=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoga pants''' are a type of flexible, form-fitting pants designed for the practice of [[yoga]] as well as other physical activities that involve a lot of movement, bending and stretching. They are typically worn for sports and physical exercise, [[martial arts]], [[dancing]], [[pilates]], or [[aerobics]]. These pants are generally made from a blend of cotton, lycra spandex, nylon, polyester, wool, or a similarly light and [[stretch fabric|stretchy synthetic material]] giving the pants a very soft, smooth, polished and silky finish when worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/15/yoga-pants-are-comfy-theyre-also-an-assault-on-manners-and-a-nihilistic-threat/ |title=Yoga pants are comfy.

Flat and fold-over waist boot cut and flare yoga pants are commonly used as casual wear, workout and exercise wear, maternity wear, making errands, lounging around the house, yoga class, or as [[clubwear]] as women would wear the body-hugging pants to permit freedom of movement when dancing during nights out at their local nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mancavin.com/galleries/club-scene/ |title=Club Girls: 10 Types of Girls You See at a Nightclub |date=29 December 2016 |website=Mancavin}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web |url=https://cilisos.my/4-must-haves-for-a-safe-night-of-clubbing-in-kl-while-still-looking-fabulous-duh/ |title=4 must-haves for a safe night of clubbing in KL (while still looking fabulous, duh) |last= Ho-Lee |first=Jasmine |date=14 April 2014 |website= Cilisos}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web |url=http://www.shape.com/fitness/clothes/workout-clothes-you-can-wear-night-out |title=Workout Clothes You Can Wear On a Night Out  |last= Malacoff |first=Julia |date=29 December 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://yoganonymous.com/you-can-find-them-in-da-club-yoga-pants-are-you-down-with-the-y-p-p/ | title=You Can Find them In da Club: Yoga Pants? | publisher= |website=Yoganonymous | date=28 January 2014 | accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://shine.yahoo.com/fashion/20-places-moms-wear-yoga-pants-without-embarrassing-184300782.html | title=20 Places Moms Can Wear Yoga Pants Without Embarrassing Themselves | publisher= |website=Yahoo | date=16 November 2012 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://www.scarymommy.com/7-reasons-yoga-pants-are-a-mommy-must/ | title=7 Reasons Yoga Pants Are A Mommy Must | publisher= |website=Scary Mommy | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://styleblazer.com/199801/yoga-pants-club-maybe-one-day/ | title=Yoga Pants At The Club?

They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and silky appearance and feel when worn.

Demand for comfortable active, athletic, sports and casual wear has increased since the turn of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stalder|first1=Erika|title=Fashion 101: A Crash Course in Clothing|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547946931|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc.]] reported their women's business comprised 7 billion in 2010&lt;ref name =Denv/&gt; and the larger market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will yoga pants have jean makers singing the blues?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-yoga-pants-have-jean-makers-singing-the-blues/|website=CBS Money Watch|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nike claims the driving factor has been by the demand for fashionable workout gear that is also flattering. New colors, patterns, and structural design of yoga pants created more versatility and increased their wear in public settings. Author Mae Anderson described the new craze of yoga pants outside the gym by calling them the "new jeans."&lt;ref name =Denv&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_24595974/how-yoga-pants-became-new-jeans|title = How yoga pants became the new jeans.|date = 25 November 2013|accessdate = 2 April 2015|website = Denver Post|publisher = |last = Anderson|first = Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many high-end fashion houses and mass-market trend-chasers have capitalized on the growth of the modern sportswear market, leading an emphasis on technical fabrics and garments that facilitate wearing them as everyday dress. Market research analysts have sought to explain the trend by referencing the extension of work hours in major cities across North America, leading to a "day-to-night" than a "gym-to-work"—while other explanations cite the North American passion for fitness and healthy living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2014/06/12/technical-fabric-in-fashion/ | title=Technical Fabric in Fashion is Here to Stay | publisher=|website=HighSnobiety | date=2 June 2014 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Brundage, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wearing in public==
In the United States, reaction to the wider adoption of yoga pants proved somewhat controversial for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foley|first1=Heather|title=Your guide to America's war on yoga pants|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/fashion/2014/04/10/america-war-yoga-pants/C7cE8EIbZdjTLbMW9luL6H/story.html|work=Boston.com|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools adopted [[dress codes]] banning yoga pants for all students, or banning them only for female students.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/03/06/rockport-high-school-leggings-ban-controversy-still-simmers/bB6p4Q7AQeriyIACzAjlWJ/story.html|title = Rockport High School leggings-ban controversy still simmers|date = 6 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = Shemkus|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/distracting-yoga-pants-banned-officials-north-dakota-high-school-article-1.1962380|title = 'Distracting' yoga pants banned by officials at North Dakota high school|date = 3 October 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Daily News|publisher = |last = Lestch|first = Corinne}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/19/school-bans-leggings_n_4993941.html|title = Parents Say School's Leggings 'Ban' Is Unfair To Girls, 'Contributes To Rape Culture'|date = 19 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine argued such bans are largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by "distraction" by girls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Elleanor|title=Instead of Banning Yoga Pants, Schools Should Crack Down on Harassment|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/instead-of-banning-yoga-pants-schools-should-crack-down-on-harassment|work=[[Bitch Magazine|Bitch]]|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar complaints caused a ban in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]], that was quickly reversed.&lt;ref name=MA /&gt;

There are others who agree with banning yoga pants in public. Most often the reasoning for disagreeing with wearing yoga pants publicly is that they promote a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Amanda Hallay, professor of fashion and cultural history at New York City's [[LIM College]], was interviewed for her opinion on yoga pants being a replacement for jeans. She said, "Yoga pants are a step above pajamas and we don't wear pajamas out to lunch, and we certainly don't wear them to work. Pajamas are for sleeping in, and ergo, not appropriate to wear in any other setting. The same can be said for yoga pants. Yoga pants are to be worn while doing yoga." Yoga pants being worn in public can be perceived as inappropriate and unattractive. According to Hallay, to promote a more business-like or mature persona, a person should dress as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That's a 'no' to yoga pants; What we wear in public has to be about more than just our comfort.|last = Rhone|first = Nedra|date = 14 March 2015|journal = Atlanta Journal-Constitution|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. state of [[Montana]], some [[Montana House of Representatives|state House]] members unsuccessfully attempted to ban the wearing of in public of "any device, costume, or covering that gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, anus region, or pubic hair region." The author of the legislation, Republican David Moore, acknowledged that the measure could extend to "tight beige garments" and stated: "Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Petri, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/02/12/absurd-things-that-almost-happened-montanas-yoga-pants-ban/ Absurd things that almost happened: Montana’s yoga pants ban], ''Washington Post'' (12 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Moore later said that the latter comment was an "off-the-cuff" joke, although the [[Associated Press]] stood by its reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Glenza, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/14/republican-montana-yoga-pants-obscenity "Republican in Montana yoga pants obscenity uproar explains: it was a joke"], ''The Guardian'' (14 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
