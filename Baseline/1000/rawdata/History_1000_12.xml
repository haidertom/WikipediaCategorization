The year '''1937''' saw a number of significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]''' history.

==Events==
*1 February – First broadcast of the [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish radio]] programme ''Dagens dikt'' ("Poem of the day"), still on the air six days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2031&amp;artikel=459027 Sveriges Radio - Dagens dikt: historik ''(in Swedish)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''aftermath of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]''', there were multiple and far-ranging events that were observed. Besides the immediate impact on the [[Casualties of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|victims]] and their families, the attacks caused [[Reactions to the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|widespread anger among the Indian public]], and condemnations from countries throughout the world.

The immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, [[Indo-Pakistani relations]], domestic impact within [[Pakistan]], the [[United States]]'s relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]].
There was also impact on the region of [[Kashmir]] and this also led to the [[2010 Kashmir Unrest]].

==Immediate impact==
===Impact on the attack locations===
[[File:Cafe leopold damage Mumbai nov 2008.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bullet marks left at Cafe Leopold]]
The [[Leopold Cafe]] opened its doors to customers just four days after the attacks. The owners wanted to repair the damaged parts of the cafe, while retaining some of the damaged pieces as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-01/mumbai/27925961_1_jehani-leopold-cafe-terrorists|title=Defiant Leopold opens doors to customers|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2008|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maharashtra state government===
After seeing the disparity between the quality of helmets and bulletproof vests used by NSG commandos and the police, the Police Commissioner of [[Pune]], Satyapal Singh, said his police officers needed the same quality equipment as used by the NSG to reduce deaths and improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Need-NSG-like-equipment--cops/391939 |title=Need NSG-like equipment: cops |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=29 November 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharashtra government has planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas, and several helicopters for the same purpose. It will also create an Anti-Terror force known as the [[Force One (Mumbai Police)|Force One]], and it will upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai Police currently have.

The CST railway station was upgraded with metal detectors, but reports say that these are ineffective because the attendants cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/57012.html |title=How India officials fumbled, McClatchy Newspapers, Padma Rao Sundarji, 03-Dec-2008 |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207034850/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/57012.html |archive-date=7 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to take forward the 26/11 probe, the Mumbai Police will send a three members team to the United States in this regard, sources said. The team comprising Inspector Bharti, Inspector Kadam and Inspector Arun Chavan will share the findings of the 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, with apex US investigative agency FBI. Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks. It is believed that the team, if permitted to go, will share the evidence gathered by Mumbai police, which prove Pakistan's hand in the attacks on the nation's integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaylive.com/news/2611-probe-mumbai-police-team-to-visit-us/607275.html |title=2611 Probe Mumbai Police Team to Visit US |publisher=Samaylive.com |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December, the [[Lok Sabha]] approved two new anti-terror bills, which are expected to pass the upper house ([[Rajya Sabha]]) on the 19th. One sets up a National Investigation Agency, similar to the [[FBI]], with sweeping powers of investigation. The second strengthens existing anti-terror laws, to allow suspects to be detained without bail for up to six months, on the orders of a judge.&lt;ref name="BBCTwoLaws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7787434.stm |title=India to tighten anti-terror laws, BBC UK, 17-Dec-2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre-State relations===
The ''National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008'', sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the [[Constitution of India]], which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past.

Union Home Minister [[P. Chidambaram]] assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under "extraordinary" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. "The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate."&lt;ref name="HinduBalance"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856661000.htm |title=Aim is to strike a balance between rights and tough laws: Chidambaram, Aarti Dhar, The Hindu, 17-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India handed over two [[demarche]]s to Pakistan – one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com" /&gt;

The Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. "It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India," the statement said. "He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage," it said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-36793420081201?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0

The [[CNN-IBN]] reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don [[Dawood Ibrahim]], [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] chief [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]] leader [[Maulana Masood Azhar]] for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack.

Dawood, India’s most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-asks-for-dawood-masood-azhars-head/79482-3-1.html

''Times of India'', quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: "Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law"

"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche", Mukherjee said, adding that India "will await" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum.&lt;ref name="Demarche_to_Pakistan" /&gt;

In an interview with [[NDTV]], Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this.&lt;ref name="CNN-IBN" /&gt;

====Denials from Pakistan====
Pakistan claimed&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856681000.htm |title=No letter from Ajmal: Pakistan, Hindu, 18-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed "incontrovertible" evidence.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

The Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the "India Tonight" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

According to Pakistan's ''Dawn'' newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed "something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law".&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

Pakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation.&lt;ref name="HinduPakDenials" /&gt;

====Interpol involvement====
Shortly after the Mumbai attacks, the [[Interpol]] team visited India and "promised help in securing the details of the 10 gunmen who attacked several places in Mumbai, 26 November, leaving at least 173 people dead and more than 300 others injured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/interpol-team-arrives-in-islamabad-for-mumbai-attacks-probe_100134269.html |title=Interpol Team Arrives in Islamabad for Mumbai Attacks Probe |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpol Secretary General [[Ronald Noble]] arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, 23 December, for talks over Indian allegations of involvement with Pakistan-based militant groups in the Mumbai terror attacks. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble met Pakistan's security officials the same day.

However, in a later press-conference, the Interpol chief said that India didn't share any specific information with the Interpol regarding the terror attacks. He said that Interpol had the same information that had been with media and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7796993.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Interpol 'not given Mumbai data' | date=23 December 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1108078 |title=Article |publisher=canada.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105195101/http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1108078 |archive-date=5 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting [[Sherry Rehman]] claimed that this statement somehow supported Pakistan government's stance that Indian government has yet to share substantial and credible evidence with them, and again offered help in due cooperation to India, for joint investigations into the Mumbai attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=19188 |title=Cricket brings both nations together: Gilani |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/pakistan-again-asks-for-credible-evidence-on-mumbai-carnage_100134814.html |title=Pakistan Again Asks for Credible Evidence on Mumbai Carnage |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, India gave Interpol the DNA of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-10/india/28046600_1_world-police-body-interpol-member-countries-dna-samples | work=The Times Of India | first1=Vishwa | last1=Mohan | title=26/11: India to give DNA samples to Interpol | date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military preparations====
{{See also|2008 India Pakistan standoff}}
On 7 December, US Senator John McCain relayed a message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to a group of Pakistanis at a lunch in Lahore, that if Pakistan did not arrest those involved with the attacks, India would begin aerial attacks against Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/07/stories/2008120757500100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=McCain warns Pakistan of Indian air strikes | date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December, private intelligence agency Stratfor, in its latest report, said, "Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan have in fact been prepared, and await the signal to go forward". They also wrote that, "Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, will be carried out in stealth". India's [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, in order to prevent terrorist infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-19/india/27914474_1_awami-national-party-pakistan-satyabrata-pal-stratfor | work=The Times Of India | title=India may still strike at Pakistan: US report | date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharma |first=Subramaniam |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=agKl44c4m8yg&amp;refer=india |title=India May Consider ‘Precision’ Strikes in Pakistan (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pakistani media, India had started deploying troops along the [[Rajasthan]] border, and had tightened security in and around the defence airstrips. More radars and quick reaction teams were then deployed along the India-Pakistan border. Indian forces were on regular firing exercises at locations, like Lathi Firing Range in [[Jaisalmer]], Mahsan in [[Bikaner]], [[Suratgarh]] and [[Ganganagar]].&lt;ref name="indiatoday.digitaltoday.in"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ramesh Vinayak |url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;issueid=85&amp;id=23314&amp;Itemid=1&amp;sectionid=4 |title=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |publisher=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December, Kamal Hyder, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Pakistan, wrote that the Pakistani "navy, air force and army were on red alert" and that "the chiefs of Pakistan's three armed forces were holding what had been described as an emergency meeting at general headquarters in Rawalpindi". He also wrote that "[t]he Pakistani air force have been seen visibly in a number of locations flying close to the Pakistani-India border, in what is being described as an aggressive patrolling mode, following reports that India is planning pre-emptive strikes against locations in Pakistan". A Pakistani airforce spokesperson said "[i]n view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2008/12/20081222102547699277.html |title=Pakistan military on 'high alert' |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said that Pakistan would mount an equal response "within minutes", to any Indian attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/0D76D46E36B67EC565257528001D342E?OpenDocument www.ptinews.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan continued to combat air patrol over several cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ramesh Vinayak |url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23412&amp;sectionid=4&amp;issueid=85&amp;Itemid=1 |title=Pak jet fighters continue flying over Lahore for 2nd day |publisher=indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taliban]] and affiliated groups openly declared their solidarity with [[Pakistan]]. The banned [[Tehrik-e-Taliban]] had proclaimed that they would send "thousands of (their) well-armed [[Militant (word)|militants]]" in order to wage [[jihad]] against [[India]] if war should break out. Hundreds of would-be bombers were equipped with suicide jackets and explosive-laden vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-23/pakistan/27943286_1_baitullah-mehsud-pak-army-taliban | work=The Times Of India | title=Taliban to back Pak army in case of hostilities with India | date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December, P.K. Barbora, the air officer commanding-in-chief of Western Air Command, said "[t]he IAF has earmarked 5,000 targets in Pakistan.

On 25 December, however, the ruling UPA government in India played down apprehensions of an imminent military conflagration. The Indian Prime Minister made it clear that "nobody wanted war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-25/india/27892218_1_nca-india-and-pakistan-nuclear-doctrine | work=The Times Of India | first1=Rajat | last1=Pandit | title=PM led N-Command meeting on Saturday | date=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Air Force also downplayed the sorties by PAF fighter jets, saying it was an air defence exercise.

On 30 December, Pakistani media stated: "The service chiefs of all of the branches of India's military were told to stay in the country in order to achieve 'complete readiness'. All units that are on exercises have been ordered to remain so indefinitely, and to indicate any equipment or ammunition they need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\12\30\story_30-12-2008_pg1_4 |title=Indian services chiefs told to stay in country, troops on alert|publisher=Dailytimes.com.pk |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not backed by Indian nor international media.

===Trials in Pakistan===
Indian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders.&lt;ref name="nytfearnewmumbai"&gt;{{cite news|last=Polgreen |first=Lydia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |title=Officials Fear New Mumbai-Style Attack, Lydia Polgreen and Souad Mekhennet, New York Times, 30 September 2009 |location=Pakistan;Mumbai (India) |work=The New York Times |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the United States===
US officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| title= Mumbai attack may trigger Indian military response’| date= 29 November 2008| accessdate= 1 December 2008| work= Indian Express| location= India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202112806/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| archivedate= 2 December 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its "absolute, total" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-36810120081201

Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for "direct and tough action" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were "non-state actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&amp;type=News| title= Rice urges Pakistan for 'direct and tough action' against Mumbai attackers| date= 3 December 2008| accessdate= 5 December 2008| publisher= [[NDTV]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033521/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&amp;type=News| archivedate= 6 December 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed2/idUSTRE4B005O20081201

After visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, "We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="HafizOpen"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-pakistan-militants_barkerdec07,0,706488.story Mumbai suspect lives freely in Pakistan, Kim Barker, Chicago Tribune, 07-Dec-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Police forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Impact on the United Kingdom===
In the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for UK citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, "currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8059148.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Battle to compensate terror victims | date=22 May 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Tom | last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK police feared similar attacks could occur in the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Citizens' movements===
The Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, [[Shivraj Patil]]. The gathering of citizens at the [[Gateway of India]] in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From [[India Gate]] and [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]] to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a [[Hindustan Times]]-[[CNN-IBN]] Initiative, [[India Today]] Group's War Against Terror, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100610/http://www.hindustanhamara.org/ Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative], besides a large number of blogs on the issue.

===February 2009 video release===
On 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715 (the year that [[Louis XIV]] died) and 1789 (the beginning of the [[French Revolution]]). International historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the [[scientific revolution]]. ''{{lang|fr|[[Philosophes|Les philosophes]]}}'' ({{Langnf||French|"the philosophers"|links=no}}) of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at [[Academy|scientific academies]], [[Masonic lodge]]s, [[literary salon]]s, [[Coffeehouse|coffee house]]s and in [[book|printed books]] and [[pamphlet]]s. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including [[liberalism]] and [[neo-classicism]], trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''Movements, Currents, Trends: Aspects of European Thought in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on [[reason]] as the primary source of authority and legitimacy and came to advance ideals like [[liberty]], [[Idea of progress|progress]], [[toleration|tolerance]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]], [[constitutional government]] and [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Outram|first=Dorinda|title=Panorama of the Enlightenment|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2006|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A84nA7Ae3t0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Panorama%20of%20the%20Enlightenment%22&amp;pg=PA29|isbn=9780892368617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Milan|last=Zafirovski|title=The Enlightenment and Its Effects on Modern Society|year=2010|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were [[individual liberty]] and [[religious tolerance]], in opposition to an [[absolute monarchy]] and the fixed dogmas of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on the [[scientific method]] and [[reductionism]], along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy—an attitude captured by the phrase ''[[Sapere aude]]'', "Dare to know".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gay, Peter|title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation|publisher=W.

The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, "Scientific Revolution and Creativity in the Enlightenment." ''Eighteenth-Century Life'' 7.2 (1982): 41–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Sootin, Harry. "Isaac Newton." New York, Messner (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; The major figures of the Enlightenment included [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Voltaire]]. Some European rulers, including [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick II of Prussia]], tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as [[enlightened absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, "Ancien Regime and Enlightenment. Some Recent Writing on Seventeenth-and Eighteenth-Century Europe," ''European History Quarterly'' 22.2 (1992): 247–55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia. [[Thomas Jefferson]] closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence (1776)]]. One of his peers, [[James Madison]], incorporated these ideals into the [[United States Constitution]] during its framing in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Ferguson, ''The American Enlightenment, 1750–1820'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential publication of the Enlightenment was the ''{{lang|fr|[[Encyclopédie]]}}'' (''Encyclopaedia''). Published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] (until 1759) and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers. It helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment: a publishing history of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Other landmark publications were Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (''Philosophical Dictionary''; 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733); Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762); Adam Smith's ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776); and Montesquieu's ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The ideas of the Enlightenment played a major role in inspiring the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789. After the Revolution, the Enlightenment was followed by the intellectual movement known as [[Romanticism]].

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes]]' [[rationalist]] philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. His attempt to construct the sciences on a secure metaphysical foundation was not as successful as his [[Cartesian doubt|method of doubt]] applied in philosophic areas leading to a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic doctrine]] of mind and matter. His [[skepticism]] was refined by [[John Locke]]'s [[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] (1690) and [[David Hume]]'s writings in the 1740s. His dualism was challenged by [[Spinoza]]'s uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his [[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|Tractatus]] (1670) and [[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]] (1677).

These laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and second, the radical enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of [[Spinoza]], advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression and eradication of religious authority.{{sfn|Israel|2006|p=15}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii, 19}} The moderate variety tended to be [[deistic]], whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative [[Counter-Enlightenment]], which sought a return to faith.{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=11}}

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]

In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. The philosophic movement was led by [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] introduced the idea of a [[separation of powers]] in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the ''Philosophes'' of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], a moral philosopher, described the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the [[scientific method]] (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name="Denby"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy|journal=The New Yorker|date=11 October 2004|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3E5hVjt?url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archivedate=29 May 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume became a major figure in the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophical]] and [[empiricist]] traditions of philosophy.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile [[rationalism]] and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/KantOnElightenment.htm|title=Kant's essay What is Enlightenment?|work=mnstate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kuehn, ''Kant: A Biography'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of England's earliest [[feminist]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Kreis |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |title=Mary Wollstonecraft, 1759–1797 |publisher=Historyguide.org |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111055540/http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings.

==Science==
{{main|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}
Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Scientific progress during the Enlightenment included the discovery of [[carbon dioxide]] (fixed air) by the chemist [[Joseph Black]], the argument for [[deep time]] by the geologist [[James Hutton]] and the invention of the steam engine by [[James Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce P. Lenman, ''Integration and Enlightenment: Scotland, 1746–1832'' (1993)  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0748603859 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris and the experiments of the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783 from the [[Château de la Muette]], near the [[Bois de Boulogne]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of [[natural philosophy]], was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.&lt;/ref&gt; Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;James E. McClellan III, "Learned Societies," in ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'', ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082517/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} (accessed on June 8, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society.&lt;ref&gt;See Gillispie, (1980), "Conclusion."&lt;/ref&gt; After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term "the Age of Academies" to describe the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton's death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 158"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700–1748) penned his "Poem to the Memory of Newton", which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1786), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology, economics and law==
[[File:Cesare Beccaria in Dei delitti crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cesare Beccaria]], father of classical criminal theory (1738–1794)]]

Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a "[[science of man]]",&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{Citation|last=M. Magnusson|title=Review of James Buchan, ''Capital of the Mind: how Edinburgh Changed the World''|journal=New Statesman|date=10 November 2003|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3JQonlV?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040|deadurl=yes|archivedate=29 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expressed historically in works by authors including [[James Burnett]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of [[modernity]]. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement&lt;ref&gt;A. Swingewood, "Origins of Sociology: The Case of the Scottish Enlightenment", ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 21, no. 2 (June 1970), pp. 164–80 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/588406 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution) and as popularised by [[Dugald Stewart]], would be the basis of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Daiches, P. Jones and J. Jones, ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment, 1730–1790'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Adam Smith published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; It was immediately preceded and influenced by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] drafts of ''[[Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth]]'' (Paris, 1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator.&lt;ref&gt;The Illusion of Free Markets, Bernard E. Harcourt, p. 260, notes 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cesare Beccaria]], a jurist, criminologist, philosopher and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece ''Of Crimes and Punishments'' (1764), later translated into 22 languages,&lt;ref name="history-world.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm |title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the Classical School of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Another prominent intellectual was [[Francesco Mario Pagano]], who wrote important studies such as ''Saggi Politici'' (Political Essays, 1783), one of the major works of the Enlightenment in Naples; and ''Considerazioni sul processo criminale'' (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Enlightenment has long been hailed as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Brewer, ''The Enlightenment Past: reconstructing eighteenth-century French thought'' (2008), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by Anglophone scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by [[Robert Darnton]], [[Roy Porter]] and most recently by Jonathan Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Dijn | first1 = Annelien | year = 2012 | title = The Politics of Enlightenment: From Peter Gay to Jonathan Israel | url = | journal = Historical Journal | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 785–805 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x12000301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of government===
John Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/influence.html |title=John Locke &gt; The Influence of John Locke's Works (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; based his governance philosophy in [[social contract theory]], a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] ushered in this new debate with his work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European [[classical liberalism|liberal thought]]: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Manent, ''An Intellectual History of Liberalism'' (1994) pp. 20–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rousseau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Like other Enlightenment philosophers, [[Rousseau]] was critical of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abolition.nypl.org/print/abolition/ The Abolition of The Slave Trade]"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in ''Two Treatises of Government'' and ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed,&lt;ref&gt;Lessnoff, Michael H. Social Contract Theory. New York: New York U, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an "unbiased judge" or common authority, such as courts, to appeal to. Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that "civil man" is corrupted, while "natural man" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established.&lt;ref&gt;Discourse on the Origin of Inequality&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the [[general will]], the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.

Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to "Life, Liberty and Property" and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] wrote in 1706: "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first =B.|last=Rand|title=The Life, Unpublished Letters and Philosophical Regimen of Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury|year=1900|page=353}} quoted in {{citation|first=Roy|last=Porter|title=Enlightenment, Britain and the Creation of the Modern World|publisher=Allen Lane, The Penguin Press|year=2000|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French National Constituent Assembly's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

The ''philosophes'' argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the [[market mechanism]] and [[capitalism]], the [[scientific method]], religious [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the ''[[philosophes]]&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' in particular to apply [[rationality]] to every problem is considered the essential change.&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Y. Landry, ''Marx and the postmodernism debates: an agenda for critical theory'' (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, both David Hume and Adam Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume's essay ''Of the Original Contract'' argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents and Hume says that the subjects would "never imagine that their consent made him sovereign", rather the authority did so.&lt;ref&gt;Of the Original Contract&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without "signing" a social contract.

Both Rousseau and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], which are not a result of law or custom, but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from John Locke in his ''Second Treatise'', when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature because you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you. Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights.

As a spillover of the Enlightenment, nonsecular beliefs expressed first by Quakers and then by Protestant evangelicals in Britain and the United States emerged. To these groups, slavery became "repugnant to our religion" and a "crime in the sight of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1981|isbn=|editor-last=Eltis|editor-first=David|location=Madison|pages=76|editor-last2=Walvin|editor-first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas added to those expressed by Enlightenment thinkers, leading many in Britain to believe that slavery was "not only morally wrong and economically inefficient, but also politically unwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Northrup|editor-first=David|location=Boston|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these notions gained more adherents, Britain was forced to end its participation in the slave trade.

===Enlightened absolutism===
{{Main|Enlightened absolutism}}
[[File:Retrato_do_Marques_de_Pombal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], as the head of the government of Portugal, implemented sweeping socio-economic reforms (abolished [[Slavery in Portugal|slavery]], significantly weakened the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], created the basis for secular public schools and restructured the tax system), effectively ruling as a powerful, progressive dictator]]

The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice – in other words, be a "philosopher-king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Williams |title=Voltaire: Political Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LV7GZhQEULEC&amp;pg=PR14 |year=1994 |pages=xiv–xv |isbn=9780521437271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Struensee - miniature portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Denmark's minister [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Johann Struensee]], a social reformer, was publicly executed in 1772]]

In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called "enlightened despots" by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''Aspects of European history, 1494–1789'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;258–66&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henderson, "Joseph II", ''History Today'' (March 1991) 41:21–27&lt;/ref&gt; Senior ministers [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Pombal in Portugal]] and [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|constitution of 1791]] expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before [[Second Partition of Poland|the nation was partitioned]] among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley, "Towards A New Nation: The Enlightenment and National Revival in Poland", ''Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism'', 1983, Vol. 10 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;83–110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick the Great]], the king of [[Prussia]] from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: "My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice&amp;nbsp;... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit".&lt;ref&gt;Giles MacDonogh, ''Frederick the Great: A Life in Deed and Letters'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the "[[consent of the governed]]" philosophy as delineated by Locke in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the "[[divine right of kings]]". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of "substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power". This illusory power came from the rise of "public opinion", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The "literary politics" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 8. See also Alexis de Tocqueville, ''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution'', 1850, Book Three, Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; De Tocqueville "clearly designates&amp;nbsp; ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ed. ''The Enlightenment: Brief History with Documents'', Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2001, Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in [[God]]. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. John Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an "unprejudiced examination" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of [[Christianity]] to be a belief in [[Christ]] the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Locke |title=Reasonableness of Christianity |volume= "Preface" The Reasonableness of Christianity, as delivered in the Scriptures |year= 1695}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]] went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his death]], as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. B. Bernstein|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vrD1WKLicwC&amp;pg=PA179|year= 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179|isbn=9780199758449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of [[organized religion]] and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ole Peter Grell|author2=Roy Porter|title=Toleration in Enlightenment Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPTdIQBIvS0C|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1–68|isbn=9780521651967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spinoza]] determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding [[Halakha|Judaic law]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Theologico-Political Treatise,'' "Preface," 1677, [http://www.gutenburg.com gutenberg.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Mendelssohn]] advised affording no political weight to any organized religion, but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Moses |last=Mendelssohn |title=Jerusalem: Or on Religious Power and Judaism|year= 1783 |url= http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mendelssohn1782.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed a good religion based in instinctive [[Morality|morals]] and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willi Goetschel|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYcOfkrduWYC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|page=126|isbn=9780299190835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including [[deism]] and talk of [[atheism]]. According to [[Thomas Paine]], deism is the simple belief in [[Creator deity|God the Creator]], with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paine, ''Of the Religion of Deism Compared with the Christian Religion,'' 1804, Internet History Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt; which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=148|isbn=9781438110219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: "In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson and Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=26|isbn=9781438110219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment: And Why it Still Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnURng7tsWIC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=100|isbn=9780199660933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Brown|title=British Philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment: Routledge History of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoIafbj8pFgC&amp;pg=PA256|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=256|isbn=9780415308779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayle (1647–1706) observed that, in his day, "prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion]," and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Bayle|title=A general dictionary: historical and critical: in which a new and accurate translation of that of the celebrated Mr. Bayle, with the corrections and observations printed in the late edition at Paris, is included; and interspersed with several thousand lives never before published.

He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23410-god-locke-and-equality-christian-foundations-of-locke-s-political-thought/|title=God, Locke and Equality: Christian Foundations of Locke's Political Thought|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|work=nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation of church and state===
{{main|Separation of church and state|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
The "Radical Enlightenment"{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=11}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=19}} promoted the concept of separating church and state,{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii}} an idea that is often credited to English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to his principle of the [[social contract]], Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority.

These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] called for a "wall of separation between church and state" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the [[Church of England]] in Virginia&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and authored the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mayer|Mayer, 1994]] p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2003]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==National variations==
[[File:Europe, 1700 - 1714.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Europe at the beginning of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], 1700]]

The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone and Charles W. J. Withers, ''Geography and Enlightenment'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt; fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment's leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Isaac Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office.

===Great Britain===
====England====
{{Further|Georgian era#English Enlightenment}}
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that, after the 1720s, England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|editor=José Rabasa |title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35 |isbn=9780199219179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One leader of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economic science]]

====Scotland====
{{Further|Scottish Enlightenment}}
In the Scottish Enlightenment, Scotland's major cities created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges.{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=248–49}} The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;A. Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (Crown Publishing Group, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Voltaire]] said that "we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Lawrence E.|title=Jews, Confucians, and Protestants: Cultural Capital and the End of Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbqn4RfUMioC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=92|isbn=9781442219649}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist; [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]]; [[Joseph Black]], physicist and chemist; and [[James Hutton]], the first modern geologist.&lt;ref name="Denby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J. Repcheck, ''The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity'' (Basic Books, 2003), pp. 117–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

====American colonies====

Several Americans, especially [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Henry F. May, ''The Enlightenment in America'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Atiyah, "Benjamin Franklin and the Edinburgh Enlightenment," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' (Dec 2006) 150#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;591–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fruchtman, Jr., ''Atlantic Cousins: Benjamin Franklin and His Visionary Friends'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic. Thinkers such as Paine, Locke and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Mann, ''1491'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas, as well as some French thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Spurlin, ''Montesquieu in America, 1760–1801'' (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; As deists, they were influenced by ideas of John Toland (1670–1722) and Matthew Tindal (1656–1733). During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon [[Liberalism in the United States|liberty]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. There was no respect for monarchy or inherited political power.  Deists reconciled science and religion by rejecting prophecies, miracles and Biblical theology. Leading deists included [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' and by Thomas Jefferson in his short ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'' – from which all supernatural aspects were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1272214/The-Founding-Fathers-Deism-and-Christianity|title=The Founding Fathers, Deism, and Christianity|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German states===
{{Further|History of Germany#Enlightenment}}Prussia took the lead among the German states in sponsoring the political reforms that Enlightenment thinkers urged absolute rulers to adopt. There were important movements as well in the smaller states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and the Palatinate. In each case, Enlightenment values became accepted and led to significant political and administrative reforms that laid the groundwork for the creation of modern states.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, "A Pre-Revolutionary Sonderweg." ''German History'' 20#3 (2002), pp 279-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The princes of Saxony, for example, carried out an impressive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the country's strong urban structure and influential commercial groups and modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Keller, "Saxony: Rétablissement and Enlightened Absolutism." ''German History'' 20.3 (2002): 309-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oer-Weimarer Musenhof.jpg|thumb|left|''Weimar’s Courtyard of the Muses'', a tribute to [[The Enlightenment]] and the [[Weimar Classicism]] depicting German poets [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]]]
Before 1750, the German upper classes looked to France for intellectual, cultural and architectural leadership, as French was the language of high society. By the mid-18th century, the ''Aufklärung'' ([[The Enlightenment]]) had transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science and literature. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers and legitimized German as a philosophic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John G. | last=Gagliardo | title=Germany under the Old Regime, 1600–1790 | year=1991 | pages=217–34, 375–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744–1803) broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement of proto-Romanticism. [[Weimar Classicism]] (''Weimarer Klassik'') was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical and Enlightenment ideas. The movement (from 1772 until 1805) involved Herder as well as polymath [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759–1805), a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first=Simon J. |editor-last=Richter | title=The Literature of Weimar Classicism | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Samantha | editor-last=Owens | editor2-last =Reul | editor2-first =Barbara M. | editor3-last =Stockigt | editor3-first =Janice B. | title=Music at German Courts, 1715–1760: Changing Artistic Priorities | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In remote [[Königsberg]], philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Manfred | last=Kuehn | title=Kant: A Biography | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats and the middle classes and it permanently reshaped the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Van Dulmen | editor2-first=Anthony | editor2-last=Williams | title=The Society of the Enlightenment: The Rise of the Middle Class and Enlightenment Culture in Germany | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a conservatism among the elites that warned against going too far.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Saine, ''The Problem of Being Modern, or the German Pursuit of Enlightenment from Leibniz to the French Revolution'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s, Lutheran ministers  [[Johann Heinrich Schulz]] and Karl Wilhelm Brumbey got in trouble with their preaching as they were attacked and ridiculed by Immanuel Kant, [[Wilhelm Abraham Teller]] and others. In 1788, Prussia issued an "Edict on Religion" that forbade preaching any sermon that undermined popular belief in the Holy Trinity and the Bible. The goal was to avoid skepticism, deism and theological disputes that might impinge on domestic tranquility. Men who doubted the value of Enlightenment favoured the measure, but so too did many supporters. German universities had created a closed elite that could debate controversial issues among themselves, but spreading them to the public was seen as too risky. This intellectual elite was favoured by the state, but that might be reversed if the process of the Enlightenment proved politically or socially destabilizing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Sauter, "The Enlightenment on trial: state service and social discipline in eighteenth-century Germany's public sphere." ''Modern Intellectual History'' 5.2 (2008): 195-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The Enlightenment played a distinctive, if small, role in the history of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dino Carpanetto and Giuseppe Ricuperati, ''Italy in the Age of Reason, 1685-1789'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burr Litchfield, "Italy" in Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 2:270-76&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Italy was controlled by conservative Habsburgs or the pope, Tuscany had some opportunities for reform. [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolished the death penalty in Tuscany and reduced censorship. From Naples, [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–69) influenced a generation of southern Italian intellectuals and university students. His textbook "Diceosina, o Sia della Filosofia del Giusto e dell'Onesto" (1766) was a controversial attempt to mediate between the history of moral philosophy on the one hand and the specific problems encountered by 18th-century commercial society on the other. It contained the greater part of Genovesi's political, philosophical and economic thought – guidebook for Neapolitan economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Guasti,  "Antonio genovesi's Diceosina: Source of the Neapolitan Enlightenment." ''History of European ideas''  32.4 (2006): 385-405.&lt;/ref&gt; Science flourished as [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Luigi Galvani]] made break-through discoveries in electricity. [[Pietro Verri]] was a leading economist in Lombardy. Historian [[Joseph Schumpeter]] states he was "the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness-and-Plenty".&lt;ref&gt;Pier Luigi Porta, "Lombard enlightenment and classical political economy." ''The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 18.4 (2011): 521-550.&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential scholar on the Italian Enlightenment has been [[Franco Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;Franco Venturi, ''Italy and the Enlightenment: studies in a cosmopolitan century'' (1972) [https://archive.org/details/italyenlightenme00vent online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Rao, "Enlightenment and reform: an overview of culture and politics in Enlightenment Italy." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 10.2 (2005): 142-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences in the mid-18th century. This era produced the first Russian university, library, theatre, public museum and independent press. Like other [[enlightened absolutism|enlightened despots]], [[Catherine the Great]] played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences and education. She used her own interpretation of Enlightenment ideals, assisted by notable international experts such as Voltaire (by correspondence) and in residence world class scientists such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Peter Simon Pallas]]. The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further [[modernization]] of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of [[serfdom in Russia]]. The Russian enlightenment centered on the individual instead of societal enlightenment and encouraged the living of an enlightened life.&lt;ref&gt;Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, "Thoughts on the Enlightenment and Enlightenment in Russia", ''Modern Russian History &amp; Historiography'', 2009, Vol. 2 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=609–632}} A powerful element was ''prosveshchenie'' which combined religious piety, erudition and commitment to the spread of learning. However, it lacked the skeptical and critical spirit of the European Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Colum Leckey,  "What is Prosveshchenie? Nikolai Novikov's Historical Dictionary of Russian Writers Revisited." ''Russian History'' 37.4 (2010): 360-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{Main|Enlightenment in Poland}}
Enlightenment ideas (''oświecenie'') emerged late in [[History of Poland|Poland]], as the Polish middle class  was weaker and [[szlachta]] (nobility) culture ([[Sarmatism]]) together with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] political system ([[Golden Liberty]]) were in deep crisis. The political system was built on [[republicanism]], but was unable to defend itself against powerful neighbors Russia, Prussia and Austria as they repeatedly sliced off regions until nothing was left of independent Poland. The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–1740s and especially in theatre and the arts peaked in the reign of King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (second half of the 18th century). Warsaw was a main centre after 1750, with an expansion of schools and educational institutions and the arts patronage held at the Royal Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Janowski, "Warsaw and Its Intelligentsia: Urban Space and Social Change, 1750-1831." ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 100 (2009): 57-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders promoted tolerance and more education. They included King Stanislaw II Poniatowski and reformers Piotr Switkowski, Antoni Poplawski, Josef Niemcewicz and Jósef Pawlinkowski, as well as Baudouin de Cortenay, a Polonized dramatist. Opponents included Florian Jaroszewicz, Gracjan Piotrowski, Karol Wyrwicz and Wojciech Skarszewski.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Butterwick, "What is Enlightenment (oświecenie)? Some Polish Answers, 1765–1820." Central Europe 3.1 (2005): 19-37.

The movement went into decline with the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) – a national tragedy inspiring a short period of sentimental writing – and ended in 1822, replaced by [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]].&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;Jerzy Snopek, [http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf  "The Polish Literature of the Enlightenment."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005232247/http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf |date=2011-10-05 }} (PDF 122 KB) ''Poland.pl.'' {{nowrap|Retrieved October 7, 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The Enlightenment has always been contested territory. According to Keith Thomas, its supporters "hail it as the source of everything that is progressive about the modern world. For them, it stands for freedom of thought, rational inquiry, critical thinking, religious tolerance, political liberty, scientific achievement, the pursuit of happiness, and hope for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, "The Great Fight Over the Enlightenment," [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/great-fight-over-enlightenment/ ''The New York Review'' April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas adds that its detractors accuse it of shallow rationalism, naïve optimism, unrealistic universalism and moral darkness. From the start, conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to [[the Terror]] during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions. As the Enlightenment was ending, Romantic philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment because it disregarded the bonds of history, myth, faith, and tradition that were necessary to hold society together.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"&gt;Thomas, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
The term "Enlightenment" emerged in English in the later part of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'',  3rd Edn (revised)&lt;/ref&gt; with particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent of the French term ''Lumières'' (used first by Dubos in 1733 and already well established by 1751). From [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?" ("[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]"), the German term became ''Aufklärun''g (''aufklären'' = to illuminate; ''sich aufklären'' = to clear up). However, scholars have never agreed on a definition of the Enlightenment, or on its chronological or geographical extent. Terms like ''les Lumières'' ([[French language|French]]), ''illuminism''o ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''ilustración'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and ''Aufklärung'' ([[German language|German]]) referred to partly overlapping movements. Not until the late nineteenth century did English scholars agree they were talking about "the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Lough |title=Reflections on Enlightenment and Lumieres |publisher=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies |year=1985 |volume= 8#1 |pages= 1–15 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.1985.tb00093.x/full |doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1985.tb00093.x |journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment [[historiography]] began in the period itself, from what Enlightenment figures said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took. [[D'Alembert's]] ''Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclopédie'' provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge – of which the ''Encyclopédie'' forms the pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;Jean le Rond d'Alembert, ''Discours préliminaire de l'Encyclopédie''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 1. The past tense is used deliberately as whether man would educate himself or be educated by certain exemplary figures was a common issue at the time. D'Alembert's introduction to l'Encyclopédie, for example, along with Immanuel Kant's essay response (the "independent thinkers"), both support the later model.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant called Enlightenment "man's release from his self-incurred tutelage", tutelage being "man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, "What is Enlightenment?", 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German scholar [[Ernst Cassirer]] called the Enlightenment "a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''The Philosophy of the Enlightenment'', (1951), p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Roy Porter]], the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] saw the Enlightenment as a phase in a progressive development which began in antiquity and that reason and challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time.&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''. pp.&amp;nbsp;492–94&lt;/ref&gt; Russell said that the Enlightenment was ultimately born out of the Protestant reaction against the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] and that philosophical views such as affinity for democracy against monarchy originated among 16th-century Protestants to justify their desire to break away from the Catholic Church. Although many of these philosophical ideals were picked up by Catholics, Russell argues that by the 18th century the Enlightenment was the principal manifestation of the schism that began with [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"/&gt;

Jonathan Israel rejects the attempts of postmodern and Marxian historians to understand the revolutionary ideas of the period purely as by-products of social and economic transformations.{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=49–50}} He instead focuses on the [[history of ideas]] in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century.{{sfn|Israel|2006|pp=v–viii}} Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization "was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition and authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=3}}

===Time span===
There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment, though the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century (1650) are often used as [[epoch (reference date)|epochs]]. French historians usually place the period, called the ''Siècle des Lumières'' ("Century of Enlightenments"), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of [[Louis XV]] until the [[French Revolution]]. If taken back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Shank, ''The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment'' (2008), "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' published in 1637.&lt;ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated"&gt;Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes&amp;nbsp;... a particular ''sub-iectum''&amp;nbsp;... lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum''&amp;nbsp;... arises out of the claim of man to a&amp;nbsp;... self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority? The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingraffia95p126"&gt;Ingraffia, Brian D.

===Modern study===
In the 1944 book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', [[Frankfurt School]] philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments|year=1947|author1=Theodor W. Adorno|author2=Max Horkheimer|editor=G. S. Noerr|translator=E. Jephcott|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press |chapter=The Concept of Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lwVjsKcHW7cC&amp;pg=PA3 |page=3|isbn=9781859841549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Extending Horkheimer and Adorno's argument, intellectual historian Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that any idea of the Age of Enlightenment as a clearly defined period that is separate from the earlier [[Renaissance]] and later [[Romanticism]] or [[Counter-Enlightenment]] constitutes a myth. Josephson-Storm points out that there are vastly different and mutually contradictory periodizations of the Enlightenment depending on nation, field of study, and school of thought; that the term and category of "Enlightenment" referring to the scientific revolution was actually applied after the fact; that the Enlightenment did not see an increase in [[disenchantment]] or the dominance of the [[mechanistic worldview]]; and that a blur in the early modern ideas of the [[Humanities]] and [[natural sciences]] makes it hard to circumscribe a Scientific Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm defends his categorization of the Enlightenment as "myth" by noting the regulative role ideas of a period of Enlightenment and disenchantment play in modern Western culture, such that belief in magic, spiritualism, and even religion appears somewhat taboo in intellectual strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 61–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, study of the Enlightenment expanded to include the ways Enlightenment ideas spread to European colonies and how they interacted with indigenous cultures and how the Enlightenment took place in formerly unstudied areas such as Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Poland, Hungary and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 6. See also, A. Owen Alridge (ed.), ''The Ibero-American Enlightenment'' (1971)., Franco Venturi, ''The End of the Old Regime in Europe 1768–1776: The First Crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals such as [[Robert Darnton]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have focused on the social conditions of the Enlightenment. Habermas described the creation of the "bourgeois public sphere" in 18th-century Europe, containing the new venues and modes of communication allowing for rational exchange. Habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational and independent from the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established authority. While the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the Enlightenment, other historians have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Robert Darnton, Roger Chartier, Brian Cowan, Donna T. Andrew.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[File:Josef II medal.jpg|thumb|A medal minted during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], commemorating his grant of religious liberty to [[Jews]] and [[Protestants]] in Hungary—another important reform of Joseph II was the abolition of [[serfdom]]]]

In contrast to the intellectual historiographical approach of the Enlightenment, which examines the various currents or discourses of intellectual thought within the European context during the 17th and 18th centuries, the cultural (or social) approach examines the changes that occurred in European society and culture. This approach studies the process of changing sociabilities and cultural practices during the Enlightenment.

One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the [[public sphere]], a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture", in the late 17th century and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;James Van Horn Melton, ''The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe'' (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the public sphere included that it was egalitarian, that it discussed the domain of "common concern," and that argument was founded on reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'', (1989), pp. 36, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas uses the term "common concern" to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere. The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is [[critical thought|critical]]), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed his disgust for slavery and often criticized the colonial policies—he always acted out of a deeply humanistic conviction, borne by the ideas of the Enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_fXXRzidVKMC#v=onepage Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography]''". University of Chicago Press. p. 138 {{ISBN|0-226-73149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of [[capitalism]]. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's [[autonomy]] and [[self-awareness]], as well as an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of [[institutions]] and the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 4, 5. Habermas, 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Daniel Brewer |title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mry1BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=91ff|isbn=9781316194324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context for the rise of the public sphere was the economic and social change commonly associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]]: "Economic expansion, increasing urbanization, rising population and improving communications in comparison to the stagnation of the previous century".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, Dorinda. ''The Enlightenment'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising efficiency in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere). Meanwhile, the colonial experience (most European states had colonial empires in the 18th century) began to expose European society to extremely heterogeneous cultures, leading to the breaking down of "barriers between cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences and geographical areas".&lt;ref&gt;Outram 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "public" implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all. However, this sphere was only public to relative degrees. Enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the "public" with that of the people: [[Condorcet]] contrasted "opinion" with populace, [[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]] "the opinion of men of letters" with "the opinion of the multitude" and [[d'Alembert]] the "truly enlightened public" with "the blind and noisy multitude".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Ozouf, "'Public Opinion' at the End of the Old Regime&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the Masonic lodges.

===Social and cultural implications in the arts===
Because of the focus on reason over superstition, the Enlightenment cultivated the arts.&lt;ref&gt;David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, ''Musicology, The Key Concepts'' (New York: Routledge, 2005), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis on learning, art and music became more widespread, especially with the growing middle class. Areas of study such as literature, philosophy, science, and the fine arts increasingly explored subject matter to which the general public, in addition to the previously more segregated professionals and patrons, could relate.&lt;ref&gt;J. Peter Burkholder, Donald J. Grout and Claude V. Palisca, ''A History of Western Music, Seventh Edition'', (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2006), 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Frideric Handel by Balthasar Denner.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Frideric Handel]]]]
As musicians depended more and more on public support, public concerts became increasingly popular and helped supplement performers' and composers' incomes. The concerts also helped them to reach a wider audience. [[Handel]], for example, epitomized this with his highly public musical activities in [[London]]. He gained considerable fame there with performances of his operas and oratorios. The music of [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]], with their Viennese Classical styles, are usually regarded as being the most in line with the Enlightenment ideals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Dictionnaire de musique'' (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was [[Charles Burney]]'s ''A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period'' (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]'s ''Deconstructive Variations'' (subtitled ''Music and Reason in Western Society'') compares Mozart's ''Die Zauberflöte'' (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives and concludes that the work is "an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number of amateur musicians. One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers and increased their presence in the amateur performers' scene, especially with keyboard music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Burkholder, Grout and Palisca, ''A History of Western Music'', 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard and chamber ensemble.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Dissemination of ideas==
The ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "Philosophes" is correct. --&gt; spent a great deal of energy disseminating their ideas among educated men and women in cosmopolitan cities. They used many venues, some of them quite new.

===The Republic of Letters===
{{Main|Republic of Letters}}
[[File:Pierre Bayle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]]]]
The term "Republic of Letters" was coined in 1664 by [[Pierre Bayle]] in his journal ''Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres''. Towards the end of the 18th century, the editor of ''Histoire de la République des Lettres en France'', a literary survey, described the Republic of Letters as being: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the midst of all the governments that decide the fate of men; in the bosom of so many states, the majority of them despotic&amp;nbsp;... there exists a certain realm which holds sway only over the mind&amp;nbsp;... that we honour with the name Republic, because it preserves a measure of independence, and because it is almost its essence to be free. It is the realm of talent and of thought.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Republic of Letters was the sum of a number of Enlightenment ideals: an egalitarian realm governed by knowledge that could act across political boundaries and rival state power.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt; It was a forum that supported "free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant considered written communication essential to his conception of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of the "reading public", then society could be said to be enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26, 26. Kant, "What is Enlightenment?"&lt;/ref&gt; The people who participated in the Republic of Letters, such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], are frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men who wrote Diderot's ''Encyclopédie'' arguably formed a microcosm of the larger "republic".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women played an essential part in the French Enlightenment, due to the role they played as ''salonnières'' in Parisian salons, as the contrast to the male ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;''. The salon was the principal social institution of the republic&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment". Women, as salonnières, were "the legitimate governors of [the] potentially unruly discourse" that took place within.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment'' (1994), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While women were marginalized in the public culture of the Old Regime, the French Revolution destroyed the old cultural and economic restraints of patronage and corporatism (guilds), opening French society to female participation, particularly in the literary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern'' (2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gentleman's Magazine 1731.JPG|thumb|Front page of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', January 1731]]
In France, the established men of letters (''gens de lettres'') had fused with the elites (''les grands'') of French society by the mid-18th century. This led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere, [[Grub Street]], the domain of a "multitude of versifiers and would-be authors".&lt;ref&gt;Crébillon fils, quoted from Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; These men came to London to become authors, only to discover that the literary market simply could not support large numbers of writers, who in any case were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 19, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers of Grub Street, the Grub Street Hacks, were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the ''libelle''. Written mostly in the form of pamphlets, the ''libelles'' "slandered the court, the Church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, everything elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself".&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Gazetier cuirassé'' by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre. It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darnton, more importantly the Grub Street hacks inherited the "revolutionary spirit" once displayed by the ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political, moral and religious authority in France.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The book industry===
[[File:1477-1799 ESTC titles per decade, statistics.png|thumb|[[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] data 1477–1799 by decade given with a regional differentiation]]
The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the "social" Enlightenment. Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices, encouraging the spread of books, pamphlets, newspapers and journals – "media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes". Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information, along with rising populations and increased urbanisation.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the [[Bibliothèque Bleue]]. Literacy rates are difficult to gauge, but in France the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion, the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

Reading underwent serious changes in the 18th century. In particular, Rolf Engelsing has argued for the existence of a ''[[Reading Revolution]]''. Until 1750, reading was done intensively: people tended to own a small number of books and read them repeatedly, often to small audience. After 1750, people began to read "extensively", finding as many books as they could, increasingly reading them alone.&lt;ref&gt;from Outram, 19. See Rolf Engelsing, "Die Perioden der Lesergeschichte in der Neuzeit. Das statische Ausmass und die soziokulturelle Bedeutung der Lektüre", Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens, 10 (1969), cols. 944–1002 and Der Bürger als Leser: Lesergeschichte in Deutschland, 1500–1800 (Stuttgart, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by increasing literacy rates, particularly among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/history-of-publishing/28681/Developments-in-the-18th-century|title=history of publishing :: Developments in the 18th century|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the reading public could not afford to own a private library and while most of the state-run "universal libraries" set up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the only sources of reading material. On one end of the spectrum was the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'', a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'' represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'', two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Mackie, ''The Commerce of Everyday Life: Selections from The Tatler and The Spectator'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1998), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;See Mackie, Darnton, ''An Early Information Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Denis Diderot 111.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Denis Diderot]] is best known as the editor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]
It is extremely difficult to determine what people actually read during the Enlightenment. For example, examining the catalogs of private libraries gives an image skewed in favor of the classes wealthy enough to afford libraries and also ignores censored works unlikely to be publicly acknowledged. For this reason, a study of publishing would be much more fruitful for discerning reading habits.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, see Chapter 6, "Reading, Writing and Publishing"&lt;/ref&gt;

Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], the man in charge of the French censor. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers.&lt;ref&gt;See Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 135–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, "general works" (those books "that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority"), demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon and are largely forgotten today as a result.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A healthy, legal publishing industry existed throughout Europe, although established publishers and book sellers occasionally ran afoul of the law. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' condemned not only by the King, but also by Clement XII, nevertheless found its way into print with the help of the aforementioned Malesherbes and creative use of French censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment'', 12, 13. For a more detailed description of French censorship laws, see Darnton, ''The Literary Underground''&lt;/ref&gt; However, many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all. Borrowing records from libraries in England, Germany, and North America indicate that more than 70&amp;nbsp;percent of books borrowed were novels. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;percent of the books were of a religious nature, indicating the general trend of declining religiosity.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"&gt;Outram, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural history===
{{Main|Natural History}}
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his {{lang|fr|Histoire naturelle}}, a 44 volume encyclopedia describing everything known about the natural world]]
A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include [[René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]]'s ''Histoire naturelle des insectes'' and [[Jacques Gautier d'Agoty]]'s ''La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain'' (1746). Outside [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.&lt;ref name="Eddy 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target audience of natural history was French polite society, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As Emma Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists "slipped between the natural world and the social&amp;nbsp;... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social".&lt;ref&gt;Emma Spary, "The 'Nature' of Enlightenment" in ''The Sciences in Enlightened Europe'', William Clark, Jan Golinski, and Steven Schaffer, eds. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of taste (''le goût'') was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class.&lt;ref&gt;Spary, 289–93.&lt;/ref&gt; From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Laqueur, ''Making sex: body and gender from the Greeks to Freud'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and literary journals===
[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' was the earliest academic journal published in Europe]]
The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'', appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market—such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese—found journal success more difficult and more often than not a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=143–44}}

Jonathan Israel called the journals the most influential cultural innovation of European intellectual culture.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=142}} They shifted the attention of the "cultivated public" away from established authorities to novelty and innovation and instead promoted the "enlightened" ideals of toleration and intellectual objectivity. Being a source of knowledge derived from science and reason, they were an implicit critique of existing notions of universal truth monopolized by monarchies, parliaments and religious authorities. They also advanced Christian enlightenment that upheld "the legitimacy of God-ordained authority"—the Bible—in which there had to be agreement between the biblical and natural theories.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=150–51}}

===Encyclopedias and dictionaries===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|upright|First page of the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', published between 1751 and 1766]]
Although the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s spanned into ancient times, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[Encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers' tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].

Along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on alphabetization, the historian [[Charles Porset]] has said that "as the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment". For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Enlightenment as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"/&gt; In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780–1789).&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 168)&lt;/ref&gt; Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"/&gt;

The first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries and instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]] and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into—it had three main branches: memory, reason and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'' and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;150–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail and provided intellectuals across Europe with a high-quality survey of human knowledge. In d'Alembert's ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work's goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:

{{quote|As an Encyclopédie, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alembert, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The massive work was arranged according to a "tree of knowledge". The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree's design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Encyclopédie'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclopédie'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclopédie'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization of science===
One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured "to make information available to the greatest number of people".&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton's]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.

[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]]]
The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90&lt;/ref&gt; These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises and books published by the academies and scientists. [[Charles Leadbetter|Charles Leadbetter's]] ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as "a Work entirely New" that would include "short and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a growing female audience, [[Francesco Algarotti]] published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by [[Henry Pemberton]]. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools and universities===
{{main|Education in the Age of Enlightenment}}
Most work on the Enlightenment emphasizes the ideals discussed by intellectuals, rather than the actual state of education at the time. Leading educational theorists like England's John Locke and Switzerland's Jean Jacques Rousseau both emphasized the importance of shaping young minds early. By the late Enlightenment, there was a rising demand for a more universal approach to education, particularly after the American and French Revolutions.

The predominant educational psychology from the 1750s onward, especially in northern European countries was associationism, the notion that the mind associates or dissociates ideas through repeated routines. In addition to being conducive to Enlightenment ideologies of liberty, self-determination and personal responsibility, it offered a practical theory of the mind that allowed teachers to transform longstanding forms of print and manuscript culture into effective graphic tools of learning for the lower and middle orders of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|issue=2|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were taught to memorize facts through oral and graphic methods that originated during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotson|first=Howard|title=Commonplace Learning: Ramism and Its German Ramifications 1543–1630|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the leading universities associated with Enlightenment progressive principles were located in northern Europe, with the most renowned being the universities of Leiden, Göttingen, Halle, Montpellier, Uppsala and Edinburgh. These universities, especially Edinburgh, produced professors whose ideas had a significant impact on Britain's North American colonies and later the American Republic. Within the natural sciences, Edinburgh's medical school also led the way in chemistry, anatomy and pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of Europe, the universities and schools of France and most of Europe were bastions of traditionalism and were not hospitable to the Enlightenment. In France, the major exception was the medical university at Montpellier.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Williams, ''A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier'' (2003) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned academies===
[[File:Sébastien Leclerc I, Louis XIV Visiting the Royal Academy of Sciences, 1671.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV]] visiting the {{lang|fr|[[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]]}} in 1671: "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century, introducing a new understanding of the natural world" — Peter Barrett&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barrett (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fwxViwX6KuMC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage Science and Theology Since Copernicus: The Search for Understanding]'', p. 14, [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], {{ISBN|0-567-08969-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Science]], founded in 1635 in Paris. It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines and it trained new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists' social status, considering them to be the "most useful of all citizens". Academies demonstrate the [[Scientific revolution|rising interest in science]] along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche'', France in the Enlightenment'', (1998), 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed to their membership, as although the majority of their members were bourgeois, the exclusive institution was only open to elite Parisian scholars. They perceived themselves as "interpreters of the sciences for the people". For example, it was with this in mind that academicians took it upon themselves to disprove the popular pseudo-science of [[mesmerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 515, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest contribution of the French Academies to the public sphere comes from the ''concours académiques'' (roughly translated as "academic contests") they sponsored throughout France. These academic contests were perhaps the most public of any institution during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna JL. ''Annales'', "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle"&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of contests dated back to the Middle Ages and was revived in the mid-17th century. The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry and painting. However, by roughly 1725 this subject matter had radically expanded and diversified, including "royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime". Topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women's education and justice in France.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy L. Caradonna, "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle", ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales'', vol.64 (mai-juin 2009), n.3, 633–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
More importantly, the contests were open to all and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging. Indeed, although the "vast majority" of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society ("the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary and the medical profession"), there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays and even winning.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 634–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a significant number of women participated—and won—the competitions. Of a total of 2,300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49—perhaps a small number by modern standards, but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the [[Royal Society of London]] also played a significant role in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/royal-charters/|title=Royal Charters|work=royalsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society played a large role in spreading [[Robert Boyle]]'s [[experimental philosophy]] around Europe and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was "a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a "collective act" and the Royal Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), 5, 56, 57. This same desire for multiple witnesses led to attempts at replication in other locations and a complex iconography and literary technology developed to provide visual and written proof of experimentation. See pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just any witness was considered to be credible: "Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants". Two factors were taken into account: a witness's knowledge in the area and a witness's "moral constitution". In other words, only civil society were considered for Boyle's public.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, 58, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salons===
{{Main|Historiography of the salon}}
It was the place in which philosophes got reunited and talked about old, actual or new ideas. Salons were the place where intellectual and enlightened ideas were built.

===Coffeehouses===
{{Main|coffeehouse|English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|l2=English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries}}
Coffeehouses were especially important to the spread of knowledge during the Enlightenment because they created a unique environment in which people from many different walks of life gathered and shared ideas. They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If classes were to join together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and because of their size might be able to carry out successful revolts. Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially those concerning foreign affairs—rulers thought political affairs to be their business only, a result of their supposed divine right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coffeehouse Civility, 1660-1714: An Aspect of Post-Courtly Culture in England|first=Lawrence E.|journal = Huntington Library Quarterly|last=Klein|date=1 January 1996|publisher=|volume=59|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.2307/3817904|jstor = 3817904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coffeehouses represent a turning point in history during which people discovered that they could have enjoyable social lives within their communities. Coffeeshops became homes away from home for many who sought, for the first time, to engage in discourse with their neighbors and discuss intriguing and thought-provoking matters, especially those regarding philosophy to politics. Coffeehouses were essential to the Enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery. Although many coffeehouse patrons were scholars, a great deal were not. Coffeehouses attracted a diverse set of people, including not only the educated wealthy but also members of the bourgeoisie and the lower class. While it may seem positive that patrons, being doctors, lawyers, merchants, etc. represented almost all classes, the coffeeshop environment sparked fear in those who sought to preserve class distinction. One of the most popular critiques of the coffeehouse claimed that it "allowed promiscuous association among people from different rungs of the social ladder, from the artisan to the aristocrat" and was therefore compared to Noah's Ark, receiving all types of animals, clean or unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This unique culture served as a catalyst for journalism when [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] recognized its potential as an audience. Together, Steele and Addison published ''[[The Spectator (1711)]]'', a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, both to entertain and to provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters.

The first English coffeehouse opened in Oxford in 1650. Brian Cowan said that Oxford coffeehouses developed into "[[penny universities]]", offering a locus of learning that was less formal than structured institutions. These penny universities occupied a significant position in Oxford academic life, as they were frequented by those consequently referred to as the ''virtuosi'', who conducted their research on some of the resulting premises. According to Cowan, "the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial".&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 90, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Café Procope]] was established in Paris in 1686 and by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city. The Café Procope in particular became a center of Enlightenment, welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau. The Café Procope was where Diderot and D'Alembert decided to create the ''Encyclopédie''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (New York: Viking, 2004), 188, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The cafés were one of the various "nerve centers" for ''bruits publics'', public noise or rumour. These ''bruits'' were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Darnton |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |publisher=American Historical Review |year=2000 |volume= 105#1 |pages=1–35 |jstor=2652433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debating societies===
{{Main|London Debating Societies}}
The debating societies are an example of the public sphere during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Donna T. Andrew, "Popular Culture and Public Debate: London 1780", ''This Historical Journal'', Vol. 39, No. 2. (June 1996), pp. 405–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Their origins include:
* Clubs of fifty or more men who, at the beginning of the 18th century, met in pubs to discuss religious issues and affairs of state.
* Mooting clubs, set up by law students to practice rhetoric.
* Spouting clubs, established to help actors train for theatrical roles.
* [[John Henley (clergyman)|John Henley]]'s Oratory, which mixed outrageous sermons with even more absurd questions, like "Whether Scotland be anywhere in the world?".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406. Andrew gives the name as "William Henley", which must be a lapse of writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|An example of a French salon]]
In the late 1770s, popular debating societies began to move into more "genteel" rooms, a change which helped establish a new standard of sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The backdrop to these developments was "an explosion of interest in the theory and practice of public elocution". The debating societies were commercial enterprises that responded to this demand, sometimes very successfully. Some societies welcomed from 800 to 1,200 spectators a night.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406–08, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics. Before the Enlightenment, most intellectual debates revolved around "confessional"&amp;nbsp;– that is, Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) or Anglican issues and the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the "monopoly of truth and a God-given title to authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}} After this date, everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason. After the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century, a "general process of rationalization and secularization set in" and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the "escalating contest between faith and incredulity".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}}

In addition to debates on religion, societies discussed issues such as politics and the role of women. However, it is important to note that the critical subject matter of these debates did not necessarily translate into opposition to the government. In other words, the results of the debate quite frequently upheld the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 412–15.&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical standpoint, one of the most important features of the debating society was their openness to the public, as women attended and even participated in almost every debating society, which were likewise open to all classes providing they could pay the entrance fee. Once inside, spectators were able to participate in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread Enlightenment ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonic lodges===
[[File:Freimaurer Initiation.jpg|thumb|Masonic initiation ceremony]]

Historians have long debated the extent to which the secret network of [[Freemasonry]] was a main factor in the Enlightenment. The leaders of the Enlightenment included Freemasons such as Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Lessing, Pope,&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Mack, Alexander Pope: A Life, Yale University Press, 1985 pages 437-440. Pope, a Catholic, was a Freemason in 1730, eight years before membership was prohibited by the Catholic Church (1738). Pope's name is on the membership list of the Goat Tavern Lodge (p. 439). Pope's name appears on a 1723 list and a 1730 list.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace Walpole, Sir Robert Walpole, Mozart, Goethe, Frederick the Great, Benjamin Franklin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. A. Leo Lemay|title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOhKqgMD10cC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=83–92|isbn=9780812209297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = Steven C. | year = 1996 | title = Initiating the Enlightenment?: Recent Scholarship on European Freemasonry | url = | journal = Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 20 | issue = 1| page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies said that Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of [[liberalism]] in Europe from about 1700 to the twentieth century. It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe. It was especially attractive to powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Age of Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct—including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability—"liberty, fraternity and equality".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob's seminal work on Enlightenment freemasonry, Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Free masonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, "Polite worlds of Enlightenment," in Martin Fitzpatrick and Peter Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' (Routledge, 2004) pp. 272–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France—by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 436.&lt;/ref&gt; The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the [[Illuminati]] founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons, but was never part of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick and Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs. They "reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives". In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 20, 73, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. For example, in French lodges the line "As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to "initiate the unenlightened". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 145–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed: "On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges".&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart Koselleck, ''Critique and Crisis'', p. 62, (The MIT Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that "although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munck, 1994, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Dalemberts_Dream.pdf |author=Denis Diderot |title=D'Alembert's Dream |year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991.)&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism and he argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of noble women in the French "lodges of adoption" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 139. See also Janet M. Burke, "Freemasonry, Friendship and Noblewomen: The Role of the Secret Society in Bringing Enlightenment Thought to Pre-Revolutionary Women Elites", ''History of European Ideas'' 10 no. 3 (1989): 283–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major opponent of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what Davies calls the reactionary Church and enlightened Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Even in France, Masons did not act as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The struggle'' (1970) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; American historians, while noting that Benjamin Franklin and [[George Washington]] were indeed active Masons, have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in causing the American Revolution because the Masonic order was non-political and included both Patriots and their enemy the Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil L. York, "Freemasons and the American Revolution", ''The Historian'' Volume: 55. Issue: 2. 1993, pp. 315+.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
The art produced during the Enlightenment was about a search for morality that was absent from previous art. At the same time, the Classical art of Greece and Rome became interesting to people again, since archaeological teams discovered Pompeii and Herculaneum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H. W.|last2=Janson|first2=Anthony|title=A Basic History of Art|date=2003|publisher=Harry n. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|pages=458–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; People took inspiration from it and revived the classical art into neo-classical art. This can be especially seen in early American art, where, throughout their art and architecture, they used arches, goddesses, and other classical architectural designs.

The '''Ahlen water tower''' is an [[Industry|industrial]] [[monument]] and [[landmark]] in the [[Ahlen]], [[Germany]].

The [[spherical]] [[water tank]] is {{convert|44|m}} high and has a capacity of {{convert|1000|m3}}. From 1915 to 1917, the water tower served as the sole water supply for the [[Westphalia]] [[Mining|mine]] and the miners colony built in 1892 by Gelsenwasser AG.&lt;ref name=triposo&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlen Water Tower|url=http://www.triposo.com/poi/Ahlen_Water_Tower|publisher=triposo.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=placeknow&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlen Water Tower|url=http://placeknow.com/attractions/germany/ahlen/ahlen-water-tower-13370|publisher=placeknow.com|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=virtualglobetrotting&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Tower Ahlen|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/abandoned-coal-mine-2/view/?service=0|publisher=virtualglobetrotting.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the distinctive blue water tower is monument and is a historical example of the early development of [[riveting]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

The '''American Society for Legal History''' is a learned society dedicated to promoting scholarship and teaching in the field of [[legal history]]. It was founded in 1956 and has an international scope, despite being based in [[the United States]]. It sponsors the [[peer-review]]ed journal ''[[Law and History Review]]'' and the book series ''Studies in Legal History'', both of which are published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/aslh |title=American Society for Legal History |website=Cambridge Core |language=en |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the Society established the ''[[American Journal of Legal History]]'', which the Society originally published as its official journal. The journal was later acquired by the [[Temple University Beasley School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv7sAgAAQBAJ |title=Journals of the Century |last=Cole |first=Jim |last2=Stankus |first2=Tony |date=2014-02-25 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317720140|page=236 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.acls.org/ |title=American Society for Legal History |website=American Council of Learned Societies |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|la|Anno Mundi}}''' ([[Latin]] for "in the year of the world"; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|לבריאת העולם}}, "to the creation of the world"), abbreviated as '''AM''', or '''Year After Creation''',&lt;ref name=YearAfterCreationChronology /&gt; is a [[calendar era]] based on the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world and subsequent history. Two such calendar eras have seen notable use historically:
*The [[Byzantine calendar]] was used  in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many Christian Orthodox countries and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and was based on the [[Septuagint]] text of the Bible. That calendar is similar to the [[Julian calendar]] except that its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is equivalent to 1 September 5509 BC on the [[Julian proleptic calendar]].
*Since the Middle Ages, the [[Hebrew calendar]] has been based on rabbinic calculations of the year of creation from the Hebrew [[Masoretic text]] of the bible. This calendar is used within Jewish communities for religious and other purposes. On the Hebrew calendar, the day begins at sunset. The calendar's epoch, corresponding to the calculated date of the world's creation, is equivalent to sunset on the Julian proleptic calendar date 6 October 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author1-link=Nachum Dershowitz|last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |author2-link=Edward M. Reingold|title=Calendrical Calculations |edition=1st |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |ISBN=0-521-56474-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new year begins at [[Rosh Hashanah]], roughly in September. Year ''anno mundi'' {{#time:xjY}}, or AM {{#time:xjY}}, began at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum}}-1 day}} on the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=13&amp;gm=9&amp;gy=2015&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=1&lt;/ref&gt;

While differences in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some differences in the creation date, most results fall relatively close to one of these two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Patriarchs from Adam to [[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]], are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint&lt;ref name=LXX5&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 5|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/5.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LXX11&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 11|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/11.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than they were in the Latin [[Vulgate]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|5|4}}; {{bibleref|Genesis|11|4}}) or the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] ({{bibleref|Gen|5|JPR}}; {{bibleref|Gen|11|JPR}}). The net difference between the two major [[genealogies of Genesis]] is 1466 years (ignoring the "second year after the flood" ambiguity), 85% of the total difference. (See [[Dating creation]].)

==Jewish tradition==
{{see| Hebrew calendar}}
During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th centuries AD, the center of the Jewish world was in the Middle East, primarily in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academies of Babylonia]] and [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel|Israel]]. Jews in these regions used [[Seleucid Era]] dating (also known as the "Anno Graecorum (AG)" or the "Era of Contracts") as the primary method for calculating the calendar year.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvVPlyYjX7YC&amp;pg=PA295 Chronology of the Old Testament, Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones] "When the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries AD, calculations from the Seleucid era became meaningless. Over those centuries, it was replaced by that of the ''anno mundi'' era of the ''Seder Olam''. From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the writings of [[Josephus]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees]] used Seleucid Era dating exclusively, and the [[Talmud]] tractate [[Avodah Zarah]] states:
{{quote|[[Rav]] [[Aha b. Jacob]] then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all? Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand? In that case, the document is really post-dated!

Said [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used. He [the questioner] thought that Rav Nahman wanted to dispose of him anyhow, but when he went and studied it thoroughly he found that it is indeed taught [in a [[Baraita]]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atenebris Adsole |url=http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_10.html |title=Avodah Zarah, tractate 10 |publisher=Halakhah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Occasionally in Talmudic writings, reference was made to other starting points for eras, such as Destruction Era dating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_9.html Avodah Zarah, tractate 9] Footnote: "The Eras in use among Jews in Talmudic Times are: (a) ERA OF CONTRACTS [H] dating from the year 380 before the Destruction of the Second Temple (312–1 BC) when, at the Battle of Gaza, Seleucus Nicator, one of the followers of Alexander the Great, gained dominion over Palestine. It is also termed Seleucid or Greek Era [H]. Its designation as Alexandrian Era connecting it with Alexander the Great (Maim. Yad, Gerushin 1, 27) is an anachronism, since Alexander died in 323 BC — eleven years before this Era began (v. E. Mahler, Handbuch der judischen Chronologie, p. 145). This Era, which is first mentioned in Mac. I, 10, and was used by notaries or scribes for dating all civil contracts, was generally in vogue in eastern countries till the 16th cent, and was employed even in the 19th cent, among the Jews of Yemen, in South Arabia (Eben Saphir, Lyck, 1866, p. 62b). (b) THE ERA OF THE DESTRUCTION (of the Second Temple) [H] the year 1 of which corresponds to 381 of the Seleucid Era, and 69–70 of the Christian Era. This Era was mainly employed by the Rabbis and was in use in Palestine for several centuries, and even in the later Middle Ages documents were dated by it. One of the recently discovered Genizah documents bears the date 13 Tammuz 987 after the Destruction of the Temple — i.e. 917 C.E. — (Op. cit. p. 152, also Marmorstein ZDMG, Vol. VI, p. 640). The difference between the two Eras as far as the tens and units are concerned is thus 20. If therefore a Tanna, say in the year 156 Era of Dest. (225 C.E.), while remembering, naturally, the century, is uncertain about the tens and units, he should ask the notary what year it is according to his — Seleucid — era. He will get the answer 536 (156 + 380), on adding 20 to which he would get 556, the last two figures giving him the year [1] 56 of the Era of Destruction."&lt;/ref&gt; being the number of years since the AD 70 [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]], and the number of years since the [[dating Creation|Creation year]] based on the calculation in the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] of Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] in about AD 160.&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Kantor&lt;/ref&gt; By his calculation, based on the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created on 1st of Tishrei ([[Rosh Hashanah]] Day 1) in 3760 BC,&lt;ref name=BirthdayAdamEve&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday of Adam &amp; Eve (3760 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/150485/jewish/Adam-Eve.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creation&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation (3761 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/156820/jewish/Creation.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishYear&gt;"To find the corresponding Jewish year for any year on the Gregorian calendar, add 3760 to the Gregorian number, if it is before Rosh Hashanah. After Rosh Hashanah, add 3761. " {{cite web|title=The Jewish year|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/526875/jewish/The-Jewish-Year.htm|work=About the Jewish Calendar|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the c. 8th-century AD [[Baraita of Samuel]].

In the 8th and 9th centuries AD, the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, so calculations from the Seleucid era "became meaningless".&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities, replacing the Seleucid dating system.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era, Alden A. Mosshammer |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system reached its definitive form in AD 1178 when [[Maimonides]] completed the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. In the section ''Sanctification of the Moon'' (11.16), he wrote of his choice of Epoch, from which calculations of all dates should be made, as "the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world" (March 22, AD 1178).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Gandz, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3622160 Date of Composition of Maimonides Code], ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', 17 (1947–1948), pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He included all the rules for the calculated calendar epoch and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, and establishing the final formal usage of the ''anno mundi'' era.

The first year of the Jewish calendar, Anno Mundi 1 (AM 1), began about one year before Creation, so that year is also called the Year of emptiness. The first five days of Jewish Creation week occupy the last five days of AM 1, Elul 25–29. The sixth day of Creation, when [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created, is the first day of AM 2, [[Rosh Hashanah]] (1 Tishrei). Its associated [[molad]] Adam (molad VaYaD) occurred on Day 5 (yom Vav) at 14 (Yud Daled) hours (and 0 parts). A year earlier, the first day of AM 1, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), is associated with [[molad tohu#Anno Mundi|molad tohu]] (new moon of chaos), so named because it occurred before Creation when everything was still chaotic — it is also translated as the new moon of nothing. This is also called molad BaHaRaD, because it occurred on Day 2 (yom Beis), 5 (Hei) hours, 204 (RaD) parts (11:11:20 pm).

[[File:Bevis Marks Synagogue P6110036.JPG|thumb|The inscription over the [[Bevis Marks Synagogue]], [[City of London]], gives a year in Anno Mundi (5461) and [[Anno Domini]] (1701).]]
The [[Septuagint]] was the most scholarly non-Hebrew version of the [[Old Testament]] available to [[early Christian]]s. Many converts already spoke Greek, and it was readily adopted as the preferred vernacular-language rendering for the eastern Roman Empire. The later Latin translation called the [[Vulgate]], an [[Christology|interpretative]] translation from the later [[Masoretic Text]] (a Jewish revision and consolidation of earlier Hebrew texts), replaced it in the west after its completion by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] c. 405, Latin being the most common vernacular language in those regions.

===Earliest Christian chronology===
The earliest extant Christian writings on the age of the world according to the biblical chronology were therefore based on the Septuagint, due to its early availability. They can be found in the ''Apology to Autolycus (Apologia ad Autolycum)'' by [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] (AD 115–181), the sixth bishop of Antioch,&lt;ref name="theophilus"&gt;[[Theophilus of Antioch]]. ''Theophilus of Antioch to Autolycus.'' Book III. Chapters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxiv.html XXIV] (Adam—Samuel), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxv.html XXV] (Saul—Cyrus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxvii.html XXVII] (Cyrus—M. Aurelius Verus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxviii.html Chap. XXVIII] (Adam—M. Aurelius Verus).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Five Books of Chronology'' by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (AD 200–245).&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Julius Africanus]]. ''Extant Writings III. The Extant Fragments of the Five Books of the Chronography of Julius Africanus.'' Chapters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_131.html III—VII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_132.html XI—XII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xiii.html XIII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_134.html XIV—XV], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xvi.html XVI], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xvii.html XVII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xviii.html XVIII].&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus presents a detailed chronology "from the foundation of the world" to emperor Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; His chronology begins with the biblical first man [[Adam]] through to emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], in whose reign Theophilus lived. The chronology puts the creation of the world at about 5529 BC: "All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total of 5,698 years."&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; No mention of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is made in his chronology. [[Seraphim Rose]] corrected the date to about 5530 BC, to recognise that there is no year 0 in [[Christian era]] dating.&lt;ref name="GENESIS 2000. p. 236"&gt;Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]].

Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] on this subject are of vital significance (''even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the [[Septuagint]], as compared to that of the [[Masoretic Text|Hebrew text]]''), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers{{refn|1=[[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene ]] (275–194 BC) represented contemporary Alexandrian scholarship; [[Eupolemus]], a Palestinian Jew and a friend of [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]], writing in 158 BC, is said to have been the first historian who synchronized Greek history in accordance with the theory of the Mosaic origin of culture. By the time of the 1st century BC, a world chronicle had synchronized Jewish and Greek history and had gained international circulation: [[Alexander Polyhistor]] (flourishing in 85–35 BC); [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC); Ptolemy priest of Mendes (50 BC), who is cited by [[Tatian]] (''Oratio ad Graecos'', 38); [[Apion]] (1st century AD); [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] (before AD 36); and [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]] (1st century AD) – all cited chronicles which had incorporated the dates of the [[Noachite]] flood and the exodus. (Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder. "Biblical Chronology in the Hellenistic World Chronicles". in ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol.61, No.3 (July 1968), pp. 451–452.)|group=note}} is preserved:

:An immense intellectual effort was expended during the [[Hellenistic period]] by both Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] to date [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], [[Flood (mythology)#Biblical deluge|the flood]], [[The Exodus|exodus]], [[Solomon's Temple|building of the Temple]]... In the course of their studies, men such as [[Tatian|Tatian of Antioch]] (flourished in 180), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died before 215), [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (died in 235), [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] of Jerusalem (died after 240), [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in Palestine (260–340), and Pseudo-Justin frequently quoted their predecessors, the Graeco-Jewish biblical chronographers of the Hellenistic period, thereby allowing discernment of more distant scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder.

===Alexandrian era===
The [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian era]], arising in AD 412, was the precursor to the [[Byzantine era]]. After the initial attempts by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and others, the Alexandrian computation of the date of creation was worked out to be 25 March 5493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias J Bickerman|title=Chronology of the Ancient World (Aspects of Greek &amp; Roman Life) |year=1980|publisher=Cornell Univ. Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-1282-X|edition=2nd sub|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexandrian monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria|Panodoros]] reckoned 5904 years from Adam to the year AD 412. His years began with 29 August, corresponding to the [[Thout|First of Thoth]], or the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] new year.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Philip Schaff (1819–1893), Ed. "Era." ''[[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]''. New Edition, 13 Vols., 1908–14. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_163.html Vol. 4, pp. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annianus of Alexandria]] however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodoros era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the ''Alexandrian era'', whose first day was the first day of the proleptic{{refn|1=A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the proleptic version of the calendar.|group=note}} Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC.

:This system presents in a masterly sort of way the mystical coincidence of the three main dates of the world's history: the beginning of Creation, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]. All these events happened, according to the Alexandrian chronology, on the 25th of March; furthermore, the first two events were separated by the period of exactly 5500 years; the first and the third one occurred on Sunday — the sacred day of the beginning of the Creation and its renovation through Christ.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"&gt;Pavel Kuzenkov (Moscow). "[http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf How old is the World? The Byzantine era κατα Ρωμαίους and its rivals"] ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093926/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 }}) ''21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies'', London 2006. pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] had earlier emphatically quoted mystical justifications for the choice of 25 March as the start of the year:
:March 25 was considered to be the anniversary of Creation itself. It was the first day of the year in the medieval [[Julian calendar]] and the nominal vernal equinox (it had been the actual equinox at the time when the Julian calendar was originally designed). Considering that Christ was conceived at that date turned March 25 into the Feast of the [[Annunciation]] which had to be followed, nine months later, by the celebration of the [[Nativity of Christ|birth of Christ]], Christmas, on December 25.

The ''Alexandrian Era'' of 25 March 5493 BC was adopted by church fathers such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]], as well as chroniclers such as [[George Syncellus]]. Its striking mysticism made it popular in Byzantium especially in monastic circles. However this masterpiece of Christian symbolism had two serious weak points: historical inaccuracy surrounding the date of [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] as determined by its [[Easter]] [[w:Computus|computus]],{{refn|1=In the commonly used 19‐year [[Easter]] moon cycle, there was no year when the Passover (the first spring full moon, Nisan 14) would coincide with Friday and the traditional date of the Passion, 25 March; according to Alexandrian system the date would have to have been Anno Mundi 5533 = 42(!)AD.|group=note}} and its contradiction to the chronology of the [[Gospel]] of [[John the Apostle|St John]] regarding the date of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] on Friday after the Passover.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt;

===Chronicon Paschale===
A new variant of the ''World Era'' was suggested in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year AD 630 by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt; It dates the creation of [[Adam]] to 21 March 5507 BC.

For its influence on Greek Christian chronology, and also because of its wide scope, the ''"Chronicon Paschale"'' takes its place beside [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and the chronicle of the monk [[George Syncellus|Georgius Syncellus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George Syncellus|George Synkellos]]. ''The Chronography of George Synkellos: a Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation''. Transl. Prof. Dr. William Adler &amp; Paul Tuffin. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; which was so important in the Middle Ages; but in respect of form it is inferior to these works.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Essen, L. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03730b.htm Chronicon Paschale]". In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of Byzantine era===
The Byzantine Anno Mundi era was the official calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] from c. AD 691 to 1728 in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. By the late 10th century the [[Byzantine era]], which had become fixed at 1 September 5509 BC since at least the mid-7th century (differing by 16 years from the Alexandrian date, and 2 years from the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''), had become the widely accepted calendar by [[Chalcedonian Christianity]]. The Byzantine era was used as the civil calendar by the [[Byzantine Empire]] from AD 988 to 1453, and by [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]] from c. AD 988 to 1700.

The computation was derived from the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Bible]], and placed the date of creation at 5509 years before the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], which was later taken to mean 5509 BC when conversions to the Christian era were desired. With a new year date of September 1, which coincides with the beginning of the Orthodox liturgical year, its epoch became 1 September 5509 BC (Julian), and year AM 1 thus lasted until 31 August 5508 BC. The "year of creation" was generally expressed in Greek in the Byzantine calendar as "Etos Kosmou", literally "year of the universe".

===Western church===
Western Christianity never fully adopted an Anno Mundi epoch system, and did not at first produce chronologies based on the Vulgate that were in contrast to the eastern calculations from the Septuagint. Since the Vulgate was not completed until only a few years before the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire#408–410; the end of an effective regular field army, starvation in Italia, sack of Rome|sack of Rome]] by the Goths, there was little time for such developments before the political upheavals that followed in the west. Whatever the reasons, the west eventually came to rely instead on the independently developed [[Anno Domini]] (AD) epoch system. AM dating did continue to be of interest for liturgical reasons, however, since it was of direct relevance to the calculation of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] (AM 5197–5199) and the [[Passion of Christ]] (AM 5228–5231). For example, [[Bede]] in his World-Chronicle (Chapter 66 of his ''[[De Temporum Ratione]]'', On the Reckoning of Time), dated all events using an epoch he derived from the Vulgate which set the birth of Christ as AM 3952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Assyrian eclipse''', also known as the Bur-Sagale eclipse, is a [[solar eclipse]] recorded in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] [[eponym list]]s, most likely dating the ninth year of the reign of king [[Ashur-dan III]].  The eclipse is identified with the one that occurred on 15 June 763 BC (proleptic Julian calendar).

The entry is short and reads:
:"[year of] Bur-Sagale of Guzana. Revolt in the city of Assur. In the month [[Babylonian_calendar#Months|Simanu]] an eclipse of the sun took place."
The phrase used — ''[[shamash]]'' ("the sun") ''akallu'' ("bent", "twisted", "crooked", "distorted", "obscured") — has been interpreted  as a reference to a solar eclipse since the first [[decipherment of cuneiform]] in the mid 19th century.
The name ''Bur-Sagale'' (also rendered ''Bur-Saggile, Pur-Sagale'' or ''Par-Sagale'') is the name of the [[limmu]] official 
in the [[eponym dating system|eponymous year]].

In 1867, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] identified near-[[total eclipse]] of 15 June 763 BC as the most likely candidate (the month ''Simanu'' corresponding to the May/June lunation),&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Henry Creswicke, "The Assyrian Canon Verified by the Record of a Solar Eclipse, B.C. 763", ''The Athenaeum: Journal of Literature, Science and the Fine Arts'', nr. 2064, 660-661 [18 May 1867].[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5dTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA660#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true]&lt;/ref&gt;  visible in northern Assyria just before noon. 
This date has been widely accepted ever since;  the identification is also substantiated by other astronomical observations from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hunger, "Zur Datierung der neuassyrischen Eponymenliste," ''Altorientalische Forschungen'', Vol. 35:2, 2008, pp. 323-325. An English translation is available on the web: [http://kristenfrihet.se/kf4/dating.htm#_ftnref1]&lt;/ref&gt;

This record is one of the crucial pieces of evidence providing an absolute [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]] for the Assyrian period.

&lt;!--
[[Babylonian calendar]]: (explain relevance to the topic)

The mainstream view is that the beginning of the Babylonian year was not determined by observing the equinox, but by observing the appearance of certain constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Schaumberger, Johann ''3. Ergänzungsheft zum Ersten und Zweiten Buch von Franz Xaver Kugler, Sterndienst and Sternkunde in Babel'', Münster in Westfalen, Verlag der Aschendorffschen Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1935, pp. 340-344 [https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125008378909#page/n109/mode/1up]; Hermann Hunger, "A Scheme for Intercalary Months from Babylonia," in ''Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes'',67. Band, Wien 1975, pp. 21-28. Cf. also Hermann Hunger's article in ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie'', Band 10, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York, 2005, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed examination of 101 New Year dates between 748 and 539 BC shows that the dates of the New Year shifted{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In the eighth century it often began before the vernal equinox. The commonly-held belief is that "the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year in the eighth century fell about two weeks before the equinox." During the reign of [[Nabopolassar]] (625-605 BC) there was a shift to about ten days after the equinox, although there still were years when the New Year began before the equinox. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In summary, the situation in Babylonia before the last third of the eighth century seems to agree with the statement in MUL.APIN (Hunger and Pingree 1989) that the vernal equinox fell on Nisan 15. Probably around 730 the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year was shifted some two weeks upwards in relation to the solar year, so the average New Year's Day fell shortly before the vernal equinox. This holds true for the entire seventh century. Only around 600 did a second shift occur, which pushed the average beginning of the year to about two weeks after the vernal equinox (figure 4B).&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Manuel "A Common Source for the Late Babylonian Chronicles Dealing with the Eighth and Seventh Centuries," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 120:4, October–December 2000, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Babylon Mystery Religion''''' is a book first published in 1966 and reprinted in 1981 by the [[Ralph Woodrow]] Evangelistic Association.  In the book Woodrow draws parallels between ancient [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] rituals and those found in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  There are references to Alexander Hislop's book ''[[The Two Babylons]]''.  

''Babylon Mystery Religion'' is now out of print and a second book is available entitled ''[[The Babylon Connection?]]'' in which Woodrow recants and refutes his views previously presented in Babylon Mystery Religion.  An online statement from the author can be found at the website.[http://www.ralphwoodrow.org/books/pages/babylon-mystery.html]

'''Bavaria Slavica''' is a historiographic term used denote the areas populated by West Slavic people ([[Wends]]) between 6th and 12th century in Northeastern Bavaria. The Wends settled in Bavaria in several waves between the 6th and ninth centuries and later in the 10th/11th century. The settlement of loyal West Slavic Wends (and other minor) tribes was favoured under Frankish emperor [[Charlemagne]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Later the [[East Frankish Empire]] also settled largely [[Christianization|Christianized]] Wends in rural or unpopulated regions or regions threatened by uprisings. After the migration stopped they were quickly assimilated by the local [[Franks]], who had always continued to form the majority, and by [[Bajuvarian]]s.

'''Bhoja II''' was a 13th-century king of the [[Paramara dynasty]] in central India. He succeeded [[Arjunavarman II|Arjuna II]] as the king of [[Dhar]]a in [[Malwa]] region.

According to ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'', written by the Jain poet Nayachandra Suri, the [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Chahmana]] ruler [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]] defeated Arjuna of Sarasapura and Bhoja of Dhara. Based on this, [[R. C. Majumdar]] concluded that Hammira must have invaded Malwa twice: once during the reign of Arjuna II, and again, during the reign of Bhoja II.{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=85-86}} Because Hammira ascended the Chauhan throne during 1282-83, Bhoja must have ascended the Paramara throne sometime after 1283 CE.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|p=828}}

Pratipal Bhatia, on the other hand, speculates that Arjuna II's minister Goga-deva rebelled against him, and put Bhoja II on the throne of Dhara as a titular king. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] describes Goga as the "Raja of Malwa". According to Bhatia's theory, Goga-deva became the ''de facto'' independent ruler of one part of the Paramara kingdom, while Arjuna II continued to control another part.{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|p=160}}

Bhoja II was succeeded by [[Mahlakadeva]].{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=853}}

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes long-term trends and processes rather than history-making individuals or events.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; Historian [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]] of the [[University of Chicago]] suggested that Big History was less politicized than contemporary history because it enables people to "take a step back."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; It uses more kinds of evidence than the standard historical written records, such as fossils, tools, household items, pictures, structures, ecological changes and genetic variations.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Critics of Big History, including sociologist [[Frank Furedi]], have deemed the discipline an "[[anti-humanist]] turn of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big History narrative has also been challenged for failing to engage with the methodology of the conventional history discipline. According to historian and educator Sam Wineburg of [[Stanford University]], Big History eschews the interpretation of texts in favor of a purely scientific approach, thus becoming "less history and more of a kind of [[evolutionary biology]] or [[quantum physics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Carbon 14 formation and decay.svg|thumb|right|[[Radiocarbon dating]] helps scientists understand the age of rocks as well as the [[Earth]] and the [[Solar System]].]]
Professor [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] argued that the recent past is only understandable in terms of the "whole 14-billion-year span of time itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Big History seeks to retell the "human story" in light of scientific advances by such methods as [[radiocarbon dating]] and [[genetic analysis]]. In some instances, it uses [[mathematical model]]ing to explore interactions between long-term trends in sociological systems, and it has led to the coining of the term [[cliodynamics]] by Peter Turchin of the [[University of Connecticut]] to describe how mathematical models might explain events such as the growth of empires, social discontent, and the collapse of nations.&lt;ref name=tws2M19&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===

[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]], in an 18-minute [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk, described some of the basics of the Big History course.&lt;ref name=tws2M28&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

===Goldilocks conditions===
[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Earth]] is ideally located in a [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks condition]]—being neither too close nor too distant from the Sun.]]
A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that culture and biology are highly intertwined, such that cultural practices may cause human brains to be wired differently from those in different societies.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt;

===Presentation by web-based interactive video===
[[File:ChronoZoom Timeline Project.jpg|thumb|[[ChronoZoom]] is a free open source project that helps readers visualize time at all scales from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago to the present.]]
Big History is more likely than conventional history to be taught with interactive "video-heavy" websites without textbooks, according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; The discipline has benefited from having new ways of presenting themes and concepts in new formats, often supplemented by Internet and computer technology.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, the [[ChronoZoom]] project is a way to explore the 14 billion year history of the universe in an interactive website format.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2M18&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

{{Quote|Welcome to First Year Experience ''Big History'' at Dominican University of California. Our program invites you on an immense journey through time, to witness the first moments of our universe, the birth of stars and planets, the formation of life on Earth, the dawn of human consciousness, and the ever-unfolding story of humans as Earth's dominant species.

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]] offers an undergraduate course entitled ''Global History'', required for all history majors, which "surveys how powerful forces and factors at work on large time-scales have shaped human history". By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a "coherent form of research and teaching" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

[[File:Bill gates portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Philanthropist [[Bill Gates]] is a major advocate of encouraging instruction in Big History.]]
There are efforts to bring Big History to younger students.&lt;ref name=tws2M12/&gt; In 2008, Christian and his colleagues began developing a course for secondary school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 2011, a pilot high school course was taught to 3,000 kids in 50 high schools worldwide.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; In 2012, there were 87 schools, with 50 in the United States, teaching Big History, with the pilot program set to double in 2013 for students in the ninth and tenth grades,&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; and even in one middle school.&lt;ref name=tws2M34&gt;{{cite news

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

===International Big History Association===
[[File:International Big History Association formed at Coldigioco, Italy.jpg|thumb|Founding members of the International Big History Association gathered at Coldigioco, Italy in 2010]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6031">The '''Charles Babbage Institute''' is a research center at the [[University of Minnesota]] specializing in the history of [[information technology]], particularly the history of digital computing, programming/software, and computer networking since 1935. The institute is named for [[Charles Babbage]], the nineteenth-century English inventor of the programmable computer.&lt;ref&gt;William Aspray, "Leadership in Computing History: Arthur Norberg and the Charles Babbage Institute." [[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]], 29(4) (October–December 2007): 16–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located in [[Elmer L. Andersen]] Library at the [[University of Minnesota Libraries]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].

==Activities==
In addition to holding important historical archives, in paper and electronic form, its staff of historians and archivists conduct and publish historical and archival research that promotes the study of the history of information technology internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/staff_publications.pdf|title=CBI Staff Publication List|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBI also encourages research in the area and related topics (such as [[archiving|archival methods]]); to do this, it offers graduate fellowships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/tfellowship.html|title=CBI Research Program: Tomash Fellowship|website=www.cbi.umn.edu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travel grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/ntravelfund.html|title=CBI Research Program: Norberg Travel Fund|website=www.cbi.umn.edu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizes conferences and workshops, and participates in public programming. It also serves as an international clearinghouse of resources for the history of information technology.

Also valuable for researchers are its extensive collection of [[oral history]] interviews, more than 400 in total.  Oral histories with important early figures in the field have been conducted by CBI staff and collaborating colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11299/59493|title=Oral history interviews|website=hdl.handle.net|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Owing to the poorly documented state of many early computer developments, these oral histories are immensely valuable documents.  One author called the set of CBI oral histories "a priceless resource for any historian of computing."&lt;ref&gt;M. Mitchell Waldrop, ''The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal'' (2001): quote p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of CBI's oral histories are transcribed and available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/index.html Oral histories], Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archival collection also contains [[manuscript]]s; records of [[professional association]]s; corporate records (including the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] corporate records and the [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]] corporate records, among many others); [[trade publication]]s; [[periodicals]]; manuals and product literature for older systems, photographic material (stills and moving), and a variety of other rare reference materials.

It is now a center at the [[University of Minnesota]], and is located on its [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]], Minneapolis campus, where it is housed in the [[Elmer L. Andersen]] Library on the West Bank.

==History==
CBI was founded in 1978 by [[Erwin Tomash]] and associates as the ''International Charles Babbage Society'', and initially operated in [[Palo Alto, California]]. 

In 1979, the ''[[American Federation of Information Processing Societies]]'' (AFIPS) became a principal sponsor of the Society, which was renamed the Charles Babbage Institute.

In 1980, the Institute moved to the [[University of Minnesota]], which contracted with the principals of the Charles Babbage Institute to sponsor and house the Institute.  In 1989, CBI became an organized research unit of the University.

'''''Christopher Columbus and the Participation of the Jews in the Spanish and Portuguese Discoveries''''' is a scholarly work by [[Meyer Kayserling]], translated into English and published in 1894. In it, Keyserling reports on an extensive search of [[List_of_archives_in_Spain|Spanish archives]] including those at [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], and [[Seville]]. His research showed that [[Marranos]], who attempted to shield themselves and their families from the [[anti-Semitic]] violence of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] by outwardly professing Christianity, were an integral part of the [[European_colonization_of_the_Americas|European colonization of the Americas]]. Keyserling's discovery of evidence that [[Luis de Torres]], who sailed with Columbus in 1492, was a Marrano is memorialized in the naming of [[Luis de Torres Synagogue]] in [[the Bahamas]].

The term '''Clean Wehrmacht''' ({{lang-de|Saubere Wehrmacht}}), '''Clean Wehrmacht legend''' (''Legende von der sauberen Wehrmacht''), or '''Wehrmacht's "clean hands"'''{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=236–238}}{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=74–76}} denotes the myth that the [[Wehrmacht]] was an apolitical organization along the lines of its predecessor, the [[Reichswehr]], and was largely innocent of [[Nazi Germany]]'s war crimes and crimes against humanity, behaving in a similar manner to the armed forces of the Western Allies. This narrative is false, as shown by the Wehrmacht's own documents, such as [[Clean Wehrmacht#Commissar Order|the records detailing the executions of Red Army commissars by frontline divisions]], in violation of the laws of war. While the Wehrmacht largely treated British and American POWs in accordance with these laws (giving the myth plausibility in the West), they routinely enslaved, starved, shot, or otherwise abused and murdered Polish, Soviet, and Yugoslav civilians and prisoners of war. Wehrmacht units also participated in the mass murder of Jews and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{illm|Urlich Herbert|de|Ulrich Herbert}} (2016): [https://books.google.com/books?id=3OrVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=wehrmacht+mass+murder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDwJGQz6rVAhWrrlQKHd_wDdMQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=wehrmacht%20mass%20murder&amp;f=false “Holocaust Research in Germany”], in ''Holocaust and Memory in Europe'', edited by Thomas Schlemmer and [[Alan E. Steinweis]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth began in the late 1940s, with former Wehrmacht officers and veterans' groups looking to evade guilt, and a few German veterans' associations and various far-right authors and publishers in Germany and abroad continue to promote such a view. Modern defenders often downplay or deny the Wehrmacht's involvement in the [[Holocaust]], largely ignore the [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|German persecution of Soviet prisoners of war]], and emphasise the role of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the civil administration in the atrocities committed.

The [[Waffen-SS]], in turn, attempted to benefit from the clean Wehrmacht myth by their veterans declaring the organisation to have virtually been branch of the latter, and to have fought as "honourably" as it. Its veteran organisation, [[HIAG]], attempted to cultivate a myth of their soldiers having been "Soldiers like any other".{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

==War of extermination==
{{Main|War of annihilation}}
[[File:Greater Germanic Reich.png|thumb|right|In their plan to create the [[Greater Germanic Reich]], the Nazi leadership aimed to conquer Eastern European territories, subjugate and exterminate the Slavic populations, and colonise the territory with ethnic German settlers.]]
In the eyes of the Nazis, the war against the [[Soviet Union]] would be a [[war of annihilation]] (''Vernichtungskrieg'').{{sfn|Förster|1988|p=21}}&lt;!---While older historiography tended to emphasize the notion of a "clean" Wehrmacht, the historian {{illm|Jürgen Förster|de|Jürgen Förster (Historiker)}} notes that "In fact, the military commanders were caught up in the ideological character of the conflict, and involved in its implementation as willing participants."{{sfn|Förster|1988|p=21}}--&gt; The [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] viewed the Soviet Union (and all of [[Eastern Europe]]) as populated by non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'' ("sub-humans"), ruled by "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]] conspirators".{{sfn||''The Fatal Attraction of Adolf Hitler'', 1989}} Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of [[Russians|Russian]] and other [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations according to the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' ("General Plan for the East").{{sfn||''The Fatal Attraction of Adolf Hitler'', 1989}} The plan consisted of the ''Kleine Planung'' ("Small Plan") and the ''Große Planung'' ("Large Plan"), which covered actions to be taken during the war and actions to be implemented after the war was won, respectively.{{sfn|Rössler|Schleiermacher|1996|pp=270–274}} The plans entailed killing the vast majority of the native population among the nations it would be implemented through starvation and deportations.

Before and during the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were heavily indoctrinated with [[anti-Bolshevik]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] propaganda.{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=59}} Following the invasion, Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people who were described as "Jewish Bolshevik subhumans", the "Mongol hordes", the "Asiatic flood" and the "Red beast".{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=59–60}} Many German troops viewed the war in Nazi terms and regarded their Soviet enemies as sub-human.{{sfn|Förster|2005|p=127}} A speech given by General [[Erich Hoepner]] indicates the disposition of Operation Barbarossa and the Nazi racial plan, as he informed the [[4th Panzer Group]] that the war against the Soviet Union was "an essential part of the German people's struggle for existence" (''Daseinskampf''), and stated, "the struggle must aim at the annihilation of today's Russia and must therefore be waged with unparalleled harshness."{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=140}}

==Foundation==
The [[Potsdam Conference]] held by the Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United States from 17 July to 2 August 1945 largely determined the occupation policies that the [[Allied-occupied Germany|defeated country]] was to face. These included [[demilitarization|demilitarisation]], [[denazification]], [[democratization]] and [[decentralization]]. The Allies' often crude and ineffective implementation caused the local population to dismiss the process as a "noxious mixture of moralism and 'victors' justice'".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=79–80}}

For those in the Western zones of occupation, the arrival of the [[Cold War]] undermined the demilitarization process by seemingly justifying a major part of Hitler's foreign policies — the "fight against Soviet bolshevism".{{sfn|Large|1987|p=80}} In 1950, after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], it became clear to the Americans that a German army would have to be revived to help face off against the Soviet Union. Both American and West German politicians were faced with the prospect of rebuilding the armed forces of the Federal Republic.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

===Himmerod memorandum===
From 5 to 9 October 1950, a group of former senior officers, at the behest of Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], met in secret at [[Himmerod Abbey]] (hence the memorandum's name) to discuss West Germany's rearmament. The participants were divided into several subcommittees that focused on the political, ethical, operational and logistical aspects of the future armed forces.{{sfn|Abenheim|1989|pp=53–54}} The "internal structure" working group was headed by General Hermann Foertsch, who in the 1930s had been a protege of Field Marshal [[Walter von Reichenau]], one of the most ardent National Socialists in the Wehrmacht, and would go on to become one of Adenauer's advisers on defense.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=236}}

The resulting memorandum included a summary of the discussions at the conference and bore the name "Memorandum on the Formation of a German Contingent for the Defense of Western Europe within the framework of an International Fighting Force". It was intended as both a planning document and as a basis of negotiations with the Western Allies.{{sfn|Abenheim|1989|pp=53–54}}

The participants of the conference were convinced that no future German army would be possible without the historical rehabilitation of the [[Wehrmacht]]. Thus, the memorandum included these key demands:
*All German soldiers convicted as war criminals would be released;
*The "defamation" of the German soldier, including those of the [[Waffen-SS]], would have to cease;
*The "measures to transform both domestic and foreign public opinion" with regards to the German military would need to be taken.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

Adenauer accepted these propositions and in turn advised the representatives of the three Western powers that German armed forces would not be possible as long as German soldiers remained in custody. To accommodate the West German government, the Allies commuted a number of war crimes sentences.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

===Public opinion===
A public declaration from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] followed in January 1951, stating that there was "a real difference between the German soldier and Hitler and his criminal group". Chancellor Adenauer made a similar statement in a [[Bundestag]] debate on the Article 131 of the ''[[Grundgesetz]]'', West Germany's provisional constitution. He stated that the German soldier fought honorably, as long as he "had not been guilty of any offense".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=236}} Article 231 expressly declared that all who served in the military and the civil service before 1945 were entitled to their full pensions, a measure that did not touch directly upon the memory of the past, but did suggest the majority of those who served the National Socialist regime were honorable people who deserved their pensions.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=238}} These declarations laid the foundation of the myth of the "clean Wehrmacht" that reshaped the West's perception of the German war effort.{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=236–238}}

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was much sympathy in Germany with those accused of war crimes and in the late 1940s and 1950s there was a flood of polemical books and essays demanding freedom for the "so-called 'war criminals'", the very phrasing of which implied that those convicted of war crimes were in fact innocent.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=239}} The German historian Norbert Frei wrote that the widespread demand for freedom for the "so-called war criminals" was "an indirect admission of the entire society's enmeshment in National Socialism"; the war crimes trials were a painful reminder of the nature of the regime that many ordinary people had identified with, and in this context, there was an overwhelming demand for the rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=240-241}} This is in part because the Wehrmacht could trace its descent back to the Prussian Army and before that to the army founded in 1640 by Frederich Wilhelm, the "Great Elector" of Brandenburg, making it an institution deeply rooted in German history, which presented problems for those who wanted to portray the Nazi era as a "freakish aberration" from the course of German history. In part, there were so many Germans who served in the Wehrmacht or who had family members who served in the Wehrmacht that there was a widespread demand to have a version of the past that allowed them to "...honor the memory of their fallen comrades and to find meaning in the hardships and personal sacrifice of their own military service".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=241-242}}

==Denial of responsibility==
{{Main|War crimes of the Wehrmacht}}
After penalties were imposed in the immediate postwar period as part of the [[denazification]] process in the late 1940s to the early 1950s, the Federal Republic of Germany's population and politicians sharply criticized the practice of "[[victor's justice]]" and the theory of [[Collective responsibility|collective guilt]] (in the opinion of historian {{illm|Norbert Frei|de|Norbert Frei}}, it was never the Allies' intention to impose collective punishment). Thus, the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament]] began to enact amnesty laws under which many war criminals saw their sentences commuted.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}}

===Political climate===

The changing political climate in the immediate post-war period aided in the creation of the image of a "clean Wehrmacht", according to which, unlike the criminal killings carried out by police and [[Schutzstaffel|SS groups]], the Wehrmacht had fought fairly under the provisions of the [[international law of war]] without involvement in the crimes of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Frei]]: ''Deutsche Lernprozesse. NS-Vergangenheit und Generationenfolge''. In: Derselbe: ''1945 und wir. Das Dritte Reich im Bewußtsein der Deutschen''. dtv, München 2009, S. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1980s and 1990s, there was something of a division of labor among historians; military historians writing the history of World War II focused on the campaigns and battles of the Wehrmacht and treated the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime in passing, if at all,{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=257}} while historians of the Holocaust and of the occupation policies of Nazi Germany largely avoided writing about the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=257}} This was not the result of a conspiracy, but rather due to the training of historians for different fields. Military historians tended to focus on battles and campaigns to the exclusion of everything else, and as a result, most military historians were not interested in the Wehrmacht's role in occupation policies in the areas it had conquered.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=254}}

The subject of the Holocaust was largely avoided outside of Israel in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=254}} The governments of Britain, the United States, France, Canada, and other countries had either imposed restrictions on Jewish refugees in the 1930s or in the case of Canada barred all Jewish refugees outright, and most did not wish to be reminded that many of the Jews turned away in the 1930s were subsequently killed in the Holocaust. As such, historians outside of Germany were not much interested in the Holocaust and there were almost no studies done of the Wehrmacht's involvement in the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" as the subject of the "Final Solution" itself attracted almost no interest until the 1960s.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} The Austrian-born American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] found that in the 1950s, few in the United States wanted to hear about the Holocaust. Successive publishers rejected his later critically acclaimed 1961 book ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', telling him that nobody in America was interested in the topic.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=276-277}}

===Memoirs and historical studies===

Former German officers published their memoirs and historical studies, which also contributed to the myth. The chief architect of this body of work was the former chief of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'', [[Franz Halder]]. He informally supervised the work of other officers who, during and since their prisoner-of-war captivity, had worked in the Operational History (German) Section of the [[United States Army Center of Military History|U.S. Army Historical Division]] and had exclusive access to the captured German war archives stored in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Wette: ''Die Wehrmacht. Feindbilder, Vernichtungskrieg, Legenden''. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2002, {{ISBN|3-7632-5267-3}}, S. 225–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case of the vanquished writing history, starting in 1947, the U.S. Army Historical Division assembled a large group of former Wehrmacht generals under the leadership of Halder to write a multi-volume history of the Eastern Front so that U.S. Army officers could learn about the tactics of the Red Army, albeit as the Germans perceived them.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=251}} The work of the Halder committee, which was a quasi-official history, was extremely influential on the memory of the war beginning in the 1950s, and the picture that the Halder committee drew of a highly professional, apolitical Wehrmacht that had nothing to do with war crimes, was widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=251}}

The German historian Wolfram Wette described Halder as having a "decisive influence in West Germany in the 1950s and 1960s on the way the history of the Second World War was written, by virtue of the knowledge he had amassed working on the studies assembled by the Historical Division, which he shared with both professional historians and interested amateurs and veterans".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=345}} Other Wehrmacht leaders like [[Erich von Manstein]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] published best-selling memoirs that depicted the Wehrmacht as victims of Hitler rather than as his followers; a group of professional, apolitical officers who were quietly opposed to National Socialism who were led into the abyss by their deranged ''Führer'' through no fault of their own.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}} Given this picture, discussion of war crimes by the Wehrmacht was completely avoided as it would damage the picture of the Wehrmacht as "victims" of Hitler.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234}}

===Trial of Erich von Manstein===
Captain [[Basil Liddell Hart]], was an influential British military historian who endorsed the "clean Wehrmacht" myth, writing with admiration that the Wehrmacht had been the mightiest war machine ever built and that it would have won the war if only Hitler had not interfered with the conduct of operations.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}} Between 1949 and 1953, Liddell Hart was deeply involved in a campaign urging the release of Manstein after a British military court convicted him of war crimes on the Eastern Front, which he called a gross miscarriage of justice.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} The trial of Manstein was a turning point in the British people's perception of the Wehrmacht; Manstein's lawyer, the Labour MP Reginald Paget, waged a well-oiled and energetic public relations campaign for amnesty for his client, enlisting many politicians and celebrities in the process.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=224-225}}

One celebrity who joined Paget's campaign, the left-wing philosopher Bertrand Russell, wrote in a 1949 essay that the enemy of the time was the Soviet Union, not Germany, and given the way in which Manstein was a hero to the German people, that it was necessary for the wartime Western Allies to free him for the needs of the Cold War.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} Liddell Hart joined Paget's campaign for freedom for Manstein, and as Liddell Hart often wrote on military affairs in British newspapers, he played a key role in winning Manstein his freedom in May 1953.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} Given Liddell Hart's general sympathy with the Wehrmacht, he depicted it in his books and essays as an apolitical force that had nothing to do with the crimes of the National Socialist regime, a subject that did not much interest Liddell Hart in the first place.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}}
 
In arguing for Manstein, Paget had made mutually exclusive contradictory arguments. Namely while knowing nothing of Nazi crimes, Manstein and other Wehrmacht officers simultaneously opposed the Nazi crimes that they were supposedly unaware of.{{sfn|Lawson|2006|p=159}} Paget lost the Manstein case with the British military tribunal presided over by Lieutenant General Frank Simpson finding Manstein supported Hitler's "war of annihilation" against the Soviet Union, enforced the Commissar Order, and as commander of the 11th Army assisted ''Einsatzgruppe'' C with massacring Jews in the Ukraine, sentencing him to 18 years in prison for war crimes.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=225-226}}

The British historian Tom Lawson wrote that Paget was greatly helped by the fact that most of the British "Establishment" naturally sympathized with the traditional elites in Germany, seeing them as people much like themselves, and for members of the "Establishment" like Archbishop George Bell the mere fact that Manstein was a German Army officer and a Lutheran who went to church regularly "..was enough to confirm his opposition to the Nazi state and therefore the absurdity of the trial".{{sfn|Lawson|2006|p=159-160}}  During and after the trial of Manstein, Paget denied that Operation Barbarossa was a "war of annihilation", down-playing the racist aspects of Barbarossa and the campaign to exterminate Soviet Jews as the supposed fonts of Communism, and instead argued that "the Wehrmacht displayed a large degree of restraint and discipline in circumstances of unimaginable cruelty".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=225}}

Wette wrote that most Anglo-American military historians had a strong admiration for the "professionalism" of the Wehrmacht, and tended to write about the Wehrmacht in a very admiring tone, largely accepting the version of history set out in the memoirs of former Wehrmacht leaders.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} Wette suggested this "professional solidarity" had something with the fact that most military historians in the English-speaking world tended to be conservative former Army officers who had a natural sympathy with conservative former Wehrmacht officers, whom they saw as men much like themselves.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} He suggested that this sympathy did not extend to Nazi Germany itself, but only the picture of a "professional" Wehrmacht committed to Prussian values that were allegedly inimical to Nazism, while displaying super-human courage and endurance against overwhelming odds, especially on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230}}

Jennifer Foray, in her 2010 study of the Wehrmacht [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupation]] of the [[Netherlands]], asserts that "Scores of studies published in the last few decades have demonstrated that the Wehrmacht's purported disengagement with the political sphere was an image carefully cultivated by commanders and foot soldiers alike, who, during and after the war, sought to distance themselves from the ideologically driven murder campaigns of the National Socialists."{{sfn|Foray|2010|pp=769–770}} Following the return of the last war prisoners from Soviet captivity, on 7 October 1955, 600 former members of the Wehrmacht and the [[Waffen-SS]] swore a public oath in the Friedland Barracks that received a strong media reaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the German people and the German dead and the Soviet Armed Forces, we swear that we have neither committed murder, nor defiled, nor plundered. If we have brought suffering and misery on other people, it was done according to the Laws of War.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Hans Reichelt]], ''Die deutschen Kriegsheimkehrer. Was hat die DDR für sie getan?'' eastern edition, Berlin 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Debunking==
In 2011, the [[Germany|German]] military historian [[Wolfram Wette]] called the "clean Wehrmacht" thesis a "collective perjury".&lt;ref&gt;''Zähe Legenden''. Interview mit Wolfram Wette, in: [[Die Zeit]] vom 1.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2011, S. 22&lt;/ref&gt; After the return of former Wehrmacht documents by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] to the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Astrid M. Eckert: ''Kampf um die Akten: Die Westalliierten und die Rückgabe von deutschem Archivgut nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg''. Franz Steiner, Stuttgart 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear through their evaluation that it was not possible to sustain the narrative any longer. Today, the extensive involvement of the Wehrmacht in numerous Nazi crimes is documented, such as the [[Commissar Order]].&lt;ref name="EnzNat"&gt;[[Gerd R. Ueberschär]]: ''Die Legende von der sauberen Wehrmacht.'' In: [[Wolfgang Benz]], [[Hermann Graml]], {{illm|Hermann Weiß (historian)|de|Hermann Weiß (Historiker)}} (Eds.): ''Enzyklopädie des Nationalsozialismus.'' Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-423-34408-1}}, S. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;

While advocates of the thesis of a "clean Wehrmacht" were attempting to describe the Wehrmacht as independent of the [[Nazi ideology]], and denying their war crimes or trying to put individual cases into perspective, more recent historical research from the 1980s and 1990s based on witness statements, court documents, letters from the front, personal diaries and other documents demonstrates the immediate and systematic involvement of the armed forces in many massacres and war crimes, especially in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="EnzNat" /&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s, two exhibitions by the [[Hamburg Institute for Social Research]] exposed these crimes to a wider audience and focused on the hostilities as a German-Soviet extermination war. The historian [[Christian Hartmann (historian)|Christian Hartmann]] found in  2009 that "no one needs to expose the deceptive myth of the 'clean' Wehrmacht any further. Their guilt is so overwhelming that any discussion about it is superfluous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Hartmann (historian)|Christian Hartmann]]: ''Wehrmacht im Ostkrieg. Front und militärisches Hinterland 1941/42.'' (= ''Quellen und Darstellungen zur Zeitgeschichte'', Band 75) Oldenbourg, München 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-486-58064-8}}, S. 790.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, historian [[Truman Anderson]] identified a new scholarly consensus centering around the "recognition of the Wehrmacht's affinity for key features of the National Socialist world view, especially for its hatred of communism and its anti-semitism".{{sfn|Anderson|2000|p=325}} Similarly, [[Ben Shepherd (historian)|Ben Shepherd]] writes that "Most historians now acknowledge the scale of Wehrmacht involvement in the crimes of the Third Reich", but maintains that "there nevertheless remains considerable debate as to the relative importance of the roles which ideology, careerism, ruthless military utilitarianism, and pressure of circumstances played in shaping Wehrmacht conduct."{{sfn|Shepherd|2009|pp=455–6}} Finally, in his last book, he points out how the "German army's moral failure and military failure" were always reinforcing each other, whether at a time of success after the victory over France, or in the days of defeat and destruction.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=536}}

===Commissar Order===
{{Main|Commissar Order}}
German historian [[Felix Römer]] has studied the implementation of the [[Commissar Order]] by the Wehrmacht, publishing his findings in 2008 as ''Der Kommissarbefehl. Wehrmacht und NS-Verbrechen an der Ostfront 1941/42 [The Commissar Order: The Wehrmacht and the Nazi Crimes on the Eastern Front, 1941–1942]''. It was the first complete account of the implementation of the order by the combat formations of the [[Wehrmacht]]. Römer's research showed that 116 out of 137 German divisions on the Eastern Front filed reports detailing the killing of the Red Army's [[political commissar]]s. In total, at least 3430 were murdered by the regular troops (and not by the SS) according to the order until May 1942, possibly up to 4,000 men.{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2016}}

Römer finds that the records "prove that Hitler's generals had executed his murderous orders without scruples or hesitations", thereby shattering vestiges of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. Historian [[Wolfram Wette]], reviewing the book, notes that the sporadic objections to the order were not fundamental, but rather driven by military necessity and that the cancellation of the order in 1942 was "not a return to morality, but an opportunistic course correction". Wette concludes: "The Commissar Order, which has always had a particularly strong influence on the image of the Wehrmacht because of its obviously criminal character, has finally been clarified. Once again the observation has confirmed itself: the deeper the research penetrates into the military history, the gloomier the picture becomes."{{sfn|Wette|2009}}

===Participation in the Holocaust===
American historian [[Waitman Wade Beorn]] has examined the complicity of the Wehrmacht in the crimes committed against Jews and other civilians in [[Belarus]], from autumn 1941 to early in the subsequent winter, in his work ''[[Marching into Darkness|Marching into Darkness: The Wehrmacht and the Holocaust in Belarus]]''. The book investigates how so-called anti-partisan warfare was connected to the [[Holocaust]] via its ideological targeting of "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-Bolsheviks]]". Beorn concludes that, because anti-semitic sentiment was lower in Belarus, the [[Army Group Centre Rear Area]], compared to the territories of [[Army Group North Rear Area|Army Group North]] and [[Army Group South Rear Area]]s, the army troops played a significantly larger role in direct persecution of Jews during the period that he studied.{{sfn|Shepherd|2015}}

Beorn addresses other aspects of Wehrmacht crimes, including its support for the starvation policy of Nazi Germany, the [[Hunger Plan]]. He examines what he calls "the progressive complicity" of the Wehrmacht, highlighting the main developments that led to the escalation of violence, such as the [[Mogilev Conference]] in September 1941. Organised by the commander of the [[Army Group Centre Rear Area]], it brought together the German Army, the SS and the [[Order Police]] commanders for an "exchange of experiences" and marked a dramatic escalation of violence against the civilian population.{{sfn|Kühne|2015}} The book looks at several military formations and how they responded to orders to commit genocide and other [[crimes against humanity]]. Beorn finds that those who refused were only lightly punished (or not punished at all), debunking the claims of German veterans that they had to participate under threat of death.{{sfn|Nelson|2014}}

==Contemporary parallels==
===Italian collaboration===
The "Clean Wehrmacht" myth parallels the emergence of a comparable narrative surrounding the participation of the [[Royal Italian Army]] during World War II. Emerging under the post-war [[Italian Republic|republic]], it was argued that "the Italians were decent people" (''Italiani, brava gente'') in contrast to the ideologically motivated and brutal Germans. In particular, it argued that the Italians had not participated in the Nazi persecution of Jews in occupied parts of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=P2004&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marta|last=Petrusewicz|title=The hidden pages of contemporary Italian history: war crimes, war guilt and collective memory|journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies|volume=9|issue=3|year=2004|pages=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodogno|first=Davide|title=Italiani brava gente? Fascist Italy's Policy Toward the Jews in the Balkans, April 1941–July 1943|journal=European History Quarterly|year=2005|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of the phenomenon in [[popular culture]] is the film ''[[Mediterraneo]]'' (1991), directed by [[Gabriele Salvatores]].&lt;ref name=P2004/&gt; This avoided "a public debate on collective responsibility, guilt and denial, repentance and pardon" but has recently been challenged by historians.&lt;ref name=P2004/&gt;

===Waffen-SS===
Analogus to the Wehrmacht [[Waffen-SS veterans in post-war Germany|Waffen-SS veterans]] and their organisation, [[HIAG]], tried to portray the [[Waffen-SS]] as a clean fighting force, innocent of war crimes. HIAG argued that the Waffen-SS was the fourth branch of the Wehrmacht and had fought honourably, like it made out the Wehrmacht to have done, and that all crimes committed by the SS, which even HIAG could not deny, had been carried out by the other, non-combat branches of the organisation. HIAG thereby combined the Waffen-SS into the myth of the "Clean Wehrmacht", something former Wehrmacht officials were not particularly comfortable about.{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}} This claim was not particularly successful as the Waffen-SS had been declared a criminal organisation after the war and, apart from the war crimes it committed, almost 60,000 of its members had served at some stage as concentration camp guards or in ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.&lt;ref name="Focus" &gt;{{cite web |last=Wiederschein  |first= Harald |url=https://www.focus.de/wissen/mensch/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/militaerisch-unbedeutend-brutal-verbrecherisch-mythos-waffen-ss-hitlers-ueberschaetzte-elitetruppen_id_4826676.html |title=Mythos Waffen-SS |publisher=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] |date=21 July 2015 |website= |access-date=22 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High level support from German post-war politicians like [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Franz-Josef Strauss]] led however to the myth of the Waffen-SS soldiers having been "Soldiers like any other".&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=25 March 1964 |title=WAFFEN-SS |trans-title= |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46173314.html |language=German |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location= |access-date=22 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">The '''Cold War International History Project''' is part of the [[History and Public Policy Program]] at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]. The Project was founded in 1991 with the support of the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] and is located in [[Washington D.C.]].

As part of its mission, the Project supports full and prompt release of historical materials by governments on all sides of the [[Cold War]], seeking to integrate new sources, materials and perspectives from the former "[[Communist bloc]]" with the [[historiography of the Cold War]]. In particular, it disseminates new information and perspectives from previously inaccessible sources from the former Communist world on the history of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="ucsb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.ucsb.edu/research/db/989 | title=Cold War International History Project | publisher=[[UC Santa Barbara Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to transcend barriers of language, geography, and regional specialization to create new links among scholars interested in Cold War history.

The Project also promotes publications pertaining to findings, views, and activities related to the Cold War; houses the Virtual Archive, the largest collection of translated, archival documents from the former communist bloc, and hosts international scholarly meetings, conferences, and seminars.

The Project is funded by grants from the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Henry Luce|Henry Luce Foundation]], the [[Smith Richardson Foundation]], the [[Leon Levy|Leon Levy Foundation]] and many others.

The Project publishes the CWIHP Bulletin and the CWIHP Working Paper Series, as well as e-dossiers (collection of archival documents), briefing books, etc. The CWIHP Working Paper Series is designed to provide an outlet for historians associated with the Project who have gained access to newly available archives and sources and would like to share their results, especially submissions by junior scholars from the former [[Communist bloc]] who have done research in their countries' archives and are looking to introduce their findings to a Western audience.&lt;ref name="ucsb"/&gt;

'''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''''' (titled '''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive''''' for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author [[Jared Diamond]], in which Diamond first defines ''collapse'':  "a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time."  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of [[societal collapse]] — particularly those involving significant influences from [[environmental change]]s, the effects of [[climate change]], hostile neighbors, [[international trade|trade partners,]] and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges— and considers the success or failure different societies have had in coping with such threats.

While the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Easter-island-moai.jpg|thumb|Diamond says [[Easter Island]] provides the best historical example of a societal collapse in isolation.]]

In the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his [[methodology]] in one paragraph:
{{quote|text=This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which [[environmental problems]] contribute. My previous book (''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Collapses of past societies ===

Diamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the forgoing four factors.

The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.

Diamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the [[Greenlandic Norse people|Greenland Norse]] to eat fish. Diamond also states that "it would be absurd to claim that [[environmental damage]] must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] is a modern counter-example, and the [[destruction of Carthage]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern societies ===
{{See also|Planetary boundaries}}

He also lists twelve [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]] facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:
# [[Deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]]
# [[Soil]] problems ([[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[soil fertility]] losses)
# [[Water management]] problems
# [[Overhunting]]
# [[Overfishing]]
# Effects of [[introduced species]] on [[native species]]
# [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]
# Increased per-capita impact of people

Further, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[Anthropogenic climate change]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buildup of [[toxin]]s in the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[energy crisis|Energy shortages]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Full human use of the Earth’s [[photosynthetic]] capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
In the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section "One-liner objections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", pages 503-514 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). In the "Further readings" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask "What can I do as an individual?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, "Further readings" section of the chapter 16, pages 569-574 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws conclusions, such as:
{{Block quote|In fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies [...] is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. [...] The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, [[resource consumption]], and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", page 509 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, he answers the question, "What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:&lt;ref name=Choices&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?", section "Reasons for hope", pages 522-524 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-term planning: "[...] the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions."&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;
* Willingness to reconsider core values: "[...] the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?"&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;

==Book structure==

''Collapse'' is divided into four parts.
*Part One describes the environment of the US state of [[Montana]], focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.
*Part Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a "framework" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five "sets of factors" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of [[trade|trading partners]], and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates "a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole." 

The societies Diamond describes are:

* The [[Greenland]] [[Norsemen|Norse]] (cf. [[Hvalsey Church]]) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).  
* [[Easter Island]] (a society that [[History_of_Easter_Island#Destruction_of_society_and_population|collapsed]] entirely due to environmental damage)
* The [[Polynesia]]ns of [[Pitcairn Island]] (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)
* The [[Anasazi]] of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)
* The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)
* Finally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:
** The tiny egalitarian Pacific island of [[Tikopia]]
** The agricultural success of egalitarian central [[New Guinea]]
** The [[forest management]] in stratified [[Japan#Ecoregions|Japan]] of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]]-era, and in [[Germany]].

*Part Three examines modern societies, including:
** The [[Rwandan genocide|collapse into genocide of Rwanda]], caused in part by overpopulation
** The failure of [[Haiti]] compared with the relative success of its neighbor on [[Hispaniola]], the [[Dominican Republic]]
** The problems facing a [[developing country|developing nation]], [[China]]
** The problems facing a [[First World]] nation, [[Australia]]
*Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and [[globalization]], and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23). Specific attention is given to the [[polder model]] as a way [[Dutch people|Dutch]] society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p.&amp;nbsp;498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of [[Sustainability|non-sustainability]]" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.

==Reviews==
[[Tim Flannery]] gave ''Collapse'' the highest praise in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', writing:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]], [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/45.full "Learning from the past to change our future"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 307, 7 January 2005, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=While he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. [...] the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that ''Collapse'' must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.}}

''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the [[future]]. Secondly, the reviewer claimed ''Collapse'' contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of [[Starvation|starving]] people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3555894 "History on an environmental scale. Of porpoises and plantations. When communities self-destruct"], ''[[The Economist]]'', volume 374, 13 January 2005, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of British Columbia]] professor of [[ecological planning]] [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] wrote that ''Collapse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that ''Collapse'' is "a necessary antidote" to followers of [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], such as [[Bjørn Lomborg]] who authored ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Rees explained this assertion as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]], [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7021/full/433015a.html "Contemplating the abyss"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 433'', 6 January 2005, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, ''Collapse'', confronts this contradiction head-on.}}

[[Jennifer Marohasy]] of the [[think-tank]] [[Institute of Public Affairs]] wrote a critical review in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'', in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Marohasy]], [http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf "Australia's Environment: Undergoing Renewal, Not Collapse"] (PDF), ''Energy and Environment'' 16 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/03/050103crbo_books?currentPage=1 "The Vanishing"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 2005-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.}}

While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.

In 2006 the book was shortlisted for [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books]] award, eventually losing out to [[David Bodanis]]' ''Electric Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Royal Society]], [http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 "Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists"] ''[[The Royal Society]]'', 2008-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and [[slave raiding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benny Peiser|author-link=Benny Peiser|year=2005|title=From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui|journal= [[Energy &amp; Environment]] |volume= 16 No. 3&amp;4|url=http://archive.4edu.info/Youth_2007/ESY_06.5_From_Genocide_to_Ecocide.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo, [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5767/1603.full "Late Colonization of Easter Island"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Questioning Collapse'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by anthropologists criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books ''Collapse'' and ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1145682|title = Review: Questioning Collapse|last = Flexner|first = James L.|date = December 2011|journal = Pacific Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2010, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] released the documentary film ''Collapse'' based on Diamond's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715324/ ''Collapse: Based on the Book by Jared Diamond'', [[Internet Movie Database]] (page visited on 10 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26059223&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology''' at the [[University of York]], England, is a [[academic department|department]] which provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in [[archaeology]] and its sub-disciplines and conducts associated research. It was founded in 1978 and has grown from a small department based at Micklegate House to more than a hundred undergraduate students based at [[King's Manor]] and with scientific facilities at the '''BioArCh''' centre on the main campus.

==Hosted organisations, research specialities and fieldwork==
The archaeology department hosts several specialist organisations:
*[[Archaeology Data Service]] - an open access digital archive for archaeological research outputs
*[[Internet Archaeology]] - a fully peer-reviewed electronic journal for archaeology
*BioArCh - a specialist centre using scientific and molecular techniques for archaeology
*Centre for Digital Heritage - an interdisciplinary centre studying computer-based approaches to heritage. Working with the universities of [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (Netherlands), [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden), [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] (Sweden).
*The ''Post Hole'' -  is an archaeology journal run by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theposthole.org/about |title=The Post Hole |accessdate=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's faculty has led significant archaeological investigations across [[Great Britain]] and occasionally further afield

The department opened in 1978, 15 years after the [[University of York#History|university]] itself. The first head of department, [[Philip Rahtz]] built a thematic undergraduate programme specialising in the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]]. The programme included a 12-week field course in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt; The department expanded under [[Martin Carver]] after his appointment in 1986. A [[postgraduate]] programme was added and the department moved to [[King's Manor]]. Subsequently, the department has grown in numbers of students, staff and the diversity of its specialisms: adding [[environmental archaeology]], [[prehistory]], [[computational archaeology]], [[archaeological science]] and [[cultural heritage management]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt;

This timeline shows the whole [[history of the universe]], the [[Earth]], and [[Human|mankind]] in one table. Each row is defined in ''years ago'', that is, [[year]]s before the present [[calendar date|date]], with the earliest times at the top of the chart. In each table cell on the right, references to events or notable people are given, more or less in chronological order within the cell.

Each row corresponds to a change in log(time before present) of about 0.1 (using log base 10). The dividing points are taken from the R′′20 [[Renard numbers]].

The table is divided into sections with subtitles. Note that each such section contains about 68% of all the time from the beginning of the section until now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21150">The '''European Association of History Educators''' (EUROCLIO) was established in 1992 with the support of the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[NGO]] works as a European wide facilitator for innovation and progress in history Education. The organisation contributes not only to the development, but also on the actual implementation of regional, national and European long-term projects, which focus on establishing knowledge, experience and expertise in the countries by training and consulting teachers. EUROCLIO develops teaching materials, builds and maintains professional Networks and acts as advisor to governments, international organisations, [[NGO]]s, History Teacher Associations and other Organisations. EUROCLIO is supported by the [[Europe for Citizens]] Programme of the European Union and has, for many years, Official Participatory Status and is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Stake Holder's Network in Education and Training.

== Background ==

=== History ===
EUROCLIO was officially founded in 1993, but already in 1992, delegates from [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (14 countries), representing 18 history Teachers Associations decided that a European organization was needed to support the learning and teaching of history by sharing and exchanging knowledge and professional experience. EUROCLIO was founded by [[Joke van der Leeuw-Roord]]. The immediate cause for the foundation of such an institute was the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 and the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1992. These events changed the scope and perspective of history and history education in Europe completely and for many countries, a European dimension in history education suddenly became possible and important for the future. History education is frequently used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]], hatred and aggression, but now the decision was made to renew contacts between East and West and reinforce a history education that could act as a tool to foster integration, peace and stability in Europe. From 1993 on, EUROCLIO grew rapidly and today it represents 64 member organizations from 46 (mostly) European countries, connecting 40,000 historians and history educators in primary, secondary and higher educational institutes.

=== Awards ===

EUROCLIO received the following international recognition:
* In 2014, the EUROCLIO programme "Sharing History, Cultural Dialogues" has been awarded the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128133248/http://www.geschichtslehrerverband.org/208.html Grand Prize] in Contest for The Best Projects of Cross-Border Cooperation in the category Education by the Congress of initiatives in Eastern Europe in Lublin.
* In 2012, the EUROCLIO programme “Historiana – Your Portal to the Past” has been awarded the Special Prize for European Collaboration in the creation of Educational Media by the [http://www.medea-awards.com/special-award-of-the-medea-jury%20%20 MEDEA Awards]. 
* In 2011, EUROCLIO received Honorable Mention for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131002150739/http://interculturalinnovation.org/euroclio/ Intercultural Innovation Award]. 
* In 2011, the EUROCLIO programme “Historiana – Your Portal to the Past” has been awarded the [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/nscentre/GE%5CWAEA_en.asp%20 World Aware Education Award] by the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe.  
* In 2009, EUROCLIO received in Brussels the Second Prize of [http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.organised-civil-society-prize-2009 European Economic and Social Council Award] for Organised Civil Society by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC).

== The organisation ==

=== Mission  ===

The organization supports the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

EUROCLIO focuses on three target areas:
* Intense professional capacity building and knowledge exchange, with a focus on the development of innovative and responsible high quality teaching professionals and the development and implementation of contemporary, class-room applicable teaching materials.
*  Dialogue, national, cross-community and trans-border networking and dissemination of information with the goal of maintaining and extending this network through all means available.
* Developing participatory and sustainable, professional civil society networks by establishing and empowering independent History Educators Associations in all European countries and beyond. These organisations act as multipliers of the EUROCLIO work on national levels.

== Activities ==

=== Teacher Training and Conferences ===

Each year, EUROCLIO organises an International Training and Development Course where, on average, History Educators from more than 35 countries meet, learn and discuss a variety of topics and good practice to broaden their perspectives. These Annual Conferences take place in different countries and in close co-operation with local History Teachers’ Associations. In 2009, the Conference was in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], on the theme “Taking the Perspective of the Others: Intercultural Dialogue and History Teaching”. This Conference is co-organised by nine Teacher Unions and History Educators’ Associations from across the divide.

All EUROCLIO Teacher Training activities are in close co-operation with both local academics and institutes for history teacher education, and international experts to train history teachers how to use the most modern teaching methods in their classes. For example: history educators everywhere recognise the importance of ICT as a learning and communications tool, and want further training in how to develop these areas and how to extend their skills in using ICT to promote historical understanding and learning. EUROCLIO operates through the medium of English for international work, and in home languages with translations for the experts supporting projects and in developmental work.

Since its foundation, EUROCLIO has organised more than 30 International Conferences and more than 70 National and Regional Training and Development Courses.

=== Programmes ===

EUROCLIO implements several long term programmes:
* '''International Trainings''' provides cross-border professional capacity building for history, heritage and citizenship educators related to innovative and responsible history education.
* '''Historiana - Your Portal to the Past''' promotes digital literacy through history, heritage and citizenship education by means of an on-line multimedia tool, offering students multi-perspective, cross-border and comparative historical resources supplementing their national history teaching tools.
* '''History that Connects in the Western Balkans''' restores the professional relations between history, heritage and citizenship educators and explores opportunities for a collaborative approach to teaching history in the region, including sensitive and controversial issues.
* '''Mediterranean Dialogues''' enables educators across the Euro-Mediterranean region to open a common dialogue, to share experiences and to develop cross-community and cross-border cooperation and networks.
* '''Innovating History Education in the Black Sea Region''' raises awareness in this region for approaches in history, heritage and citizenship education, which enhance democracy and intercultural dialogue and is creating sustainable national and cross border networks.

'''Fourierism''' is the systematic set of economic, political, and social beliefs first espoused by French intellectual [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837). Based upon a belief in the inevitability of communal associations of people who worked and lived together as part of the human future, Fourier's committed supporters referred to his doctrines as '''Associationism'''. Political contemporaries and subsequent scholarship has identified Fourier's set of ideas as a form of [[utopian socialism]]{{Spaced en dash}}a phrase which retains mild pejorative overtones.

Never tested in practice at any scale in Fourier's lifetime, Fourierism enjoyed a brief boom in the [[United States of America]] during the middle of the 1840s{{Spaced en dash}}owing largely to the efforts of his American popularizer, [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890) and the [[American Union of Associationists]]{{Spaced en dash}}but ultimately failed as a social and economic model. The system was briefly revived in the middle 1850s by [[Victor Prosper Considerant|Victor Considerant]] (1808–1893), a French disciple of Fourier's who [[La Reunion (Dallas)|unsuccessfully attempted to relaunch]] the model in the American state of [[Texas]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Beecher, ''Victor Considerant''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
===Passional attraction===

In contrast to the thoroughly [[secular]] communitarianism of his contemporary [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), [[Charles Fourier|Charles Fourier's]] thinking starts from a presumption of the existence of God and a divine social order on Earth in accordance with the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Franklin (ed.), "Introduction" to [https://archive.org/details/selectionsfromw00fourgoog ''Selections from the Works of Fourier.''] London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1901; pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier saw himself as a figure of world-historical importance akin to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) for having identified the fundamental force driving social development, which he called "passional attraction" ''(attraction passionelle).''&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier believed that the structure of the world{{Spaced en dash}}that is the economic, political, and social system{{Spaced en dash}}inhibited humanity from the pursuit of their God-given individual passions, thereby preventing mankind from achieving a state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seeking to mold individuals to fit the existing form of economic, political, and social life, as had been the traditional goal of the educational and what we today call the [[socialization]] process, Fourier believed that instead the form of economic, political, and social life should itself be altered to fit the inherent passions of the individual, since these economic and social structures were man-made and not God-given.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Through conscious understanding of this process, which Fourier characterized as "social science," new economic and social formations called "Associations" could be created, structured in such a way as to allow individuals to follow their passions and in this way advance towards the state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Always one to list and to systematize, Fourier declared there existed twelve basic passions of humanity grouped around three branches of a "passional tree": "luxurious passions" of the senses; "affective passions" of love, friendship, and parenthood; and the oft-ignored "distributive passions" such as the need for political intrigue, the need for variety, and the pure enthusiasm of spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all these passions Fourier called "unityism," characterized as a universal feeling of benevolence and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt; Although fettered and mutated by Civilization, the free development of these passions would be allowed in the bright future world, Fourier believed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt;

===Stages of society===

Fourier believed himself the discoverer of the universal laws of societal evolution, theorizing the existence of 32 distinct periods beginning with Edenism and continuing through Savagery, Patriarchate, and Barbarism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these stages was held to have distinctive material and ideological features, with the treatment afforded to women a particular marker of one stage from the next.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Of far greater concern to Fourier and his disciples was the current 5th form of society, Modern Society, as well as three emerging forms which were believed to be just around the corner: 6 (Guarantism), 7 (Simple Association), and 8 (Compound Association).&lt;ref name=Sears1-2&gt;Charles Sears, [https://archive.org/details/TheNorthAmericanPhalanx ''The North American Phalanx: An Historical and Descriptive Sketch.''] Prescott, WI: John M. Pryse, Publisher, 1886; pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Modern Society," from the Fourierist perspective, was based upon capital and labor and the buying and selling of goods through a network of useless middlemen.&lt;ref name=Sears1&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With a sneer, Fourier referred to contemporary society as "Civilization," deeming it the cause of fraud, waste, and human unhappiness.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The "isolated family" he deemed inefficient, the wage system demoralizing and exploitative, and organized religion corrupt.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; An entire book was written detailing 36 types of bankruptcy and 76 sorts of "cuckoldry" to which humanity was subjected by its system of so-called Civilization, which Fourier viewed not only as imperfect but as wholly unacceptable.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt;

Fourier believed that fortunately for humanity, the Civilization of modern society was a fleeting economic formation, soon to vanish from the Earth.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; The emerging socio-economic structure of "Guarantism" would be based upon the fundamental principle of universal insurance, Fourier believed, which was to include guarantee of the security of capital and guarantee on the right of labor to gainful employment.&lt;ref name=Sears1-2 /&gt; Petty traders and speculative profiteers would be eliminated from the economy in this new system of organized production and distribution, it was believed.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

The next stage in the Fourierist schema, that of "Simple Association," was to be based upon the cooperative enterprise of like bodies of farmers or artisans or industrial workers as distinct groups.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Farmers would associate with other farmers, artisans with other artisans, industrial producers with other industrial producers, producing and selling their goods collectively.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Simultaneously, these economic organizations were to for the first time include the association of family living and domestic labor,&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; thereby eliminating the economic waste and social isolation of individual living. [[Wage labour|Wage labor]] would be eliminated, as the members of each of these associations would be co-proprietors, producing in tandem and sharing alike in the proceeds of their efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

Subsequently, the Fourierists believed, there would emerge "Compound Association" or "Harmonism." Under Compound Association all pursuits – industrial producers and artisans and farmers alike – would join in large associations which would shatter all economic lines.&lt;ref name=Sears2&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One Fourierian enthusiast described the system of Compound Association in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every interest is provided for, by an organization which embraces all details of production and distribution; and a system of natural and integral education is instituted – that is, a complete system of physical, mental, and emotional development, intimately connected with daily pursuits, provided for; that art and the science which underlies art may be taught together; that theory and practice may go hand in hand and that the individual may have the command of his whole personal power and enjoy the conditions of expressing it.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every individual in these Compound Associations would be free to take part in the labor of a dozen or more different work groups, according to their interests and pleasure, over the course of any year, in the Fourierist vision.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; That which the [[Marxism|Marxists]] called [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of labor]] would thereby be eliminated and production boosted, since "a man having himself on his own side works with more force, greater skill, and better effect than one who works against his inclinations," in the words of one Fourierian.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

===Economics===

Fourier believed that economic output was the product of three factors: labor, capital, and talent.&lt;ref name=Franklin20&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, he argued, were important to production and each needed to be compensated as such for the general prosperity of the organized association to be preserved.&lt;ref name=Franklin20 /&gt; The communal associations which emerged based upon Fourier's ideas were generally formed as [[joint stock companies]], and their investor-members were compensated separately on the basis both of amount of capital invested and amount of labor performed – with labor time given a range of values based both on the necessity and difficulty of the work and the degree of talent and skill with which it was performed.

===Social life===
[[File:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Elevated view of a Fourierist ''Phalanstère'' from the works of Victor Considerant.]]

Fourier's prescription was the establishment of communities called Phalanxes or Associations in the countryside. Housed inside gigantic serpentine edifices called "phalanstries" would be 1620 people, coming from various occupations and social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; These residents were to be arranged in occupational "series," according to Fourier's model – major divisions such as between agrarians and industrial producers and artisans – which would be further divided into smaller "groups" to cooperatively conduct specific aspects of the work.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility of the individual between various groups and even sections according to personal desires was to be allowed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

Fundamental to the Fourierian ideal was the notion of collective living and the rational performance of domestic duties. Individual households were seen as both wasteful in terms of duplicated effort performed and isolating of individuals – standing in the way of true cooperation and social harmony.

Remaining in unpublished manuscript form until 1967 would be Fourier's imaginative predictions about degrees of sexual promiscuity and the institutions and moral codes which would emerge to govern love and interpersonal relationships in the harmonious world of Compound Association.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

===Role of force===

The Fourierian system of associations was based on the notion of voluntary participation and expansion through the force of example. Once founded, associations would demonstrate their practical merits and inspire emulation, with the first model communities replicating and spreading from localities to regions to nations and internationally. Never in his writings does Fourier appeal for the use of governmental legislation or coercive power of any sort, instead believing association to be a natural and wholly voluntary structure,&lt;ref name=Franklin21&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; part of a Divine Social Code.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

Moreover, the achievement on an international scale would eliminate war from the face of the earth.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Instead, industrial armies would be formed to engage in gigantic reclamation projects, irrigating deserts and restoring vegetation and draining marshes and putting the land to cultivation.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; The elimination of disease would follow, as such banes as [[cholera]], [[typhus]], and [[yellow fever]] would vanish with the unhealthful places from whence they originated before society's restorative efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Through the planting of vast swaths of timber, cropland would be protected and the earth's climate itself would be slowly transformed, Fourier and his followers believed.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantastic theories===

Fourier's theoretical system, described by one scholar as "vast and eccentric,"&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; was only a part of the output of what another called "a most riotous and unpruned imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gray to the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, March 15, 1923. Quoted in "The Chaos and Sense of Fourier," ''Aberdeen Journal,'' March 16, 1923, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier believed that in the new world people would live for 144 years, that new species of friendly and pacifistic animals such as "anti-lions" would emerge, and that over time human beings would develop long and useful tails.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Fourier also professed a belief in the ability of [[Metempsychosis|human souls to migrate]] between physical and "aromal" worlds.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Such thinking was set aside during the last 15 years of Fourier's life, when he instead began to concentrate on testing in practice his economic and social ideas.&lt;ref name=Guarneri20&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's disciples, including in the first rank the American Albert Brisbane and the French Victor Considerant, later pared down Fourier's writings into a comprehensible system for economic and social organization, with the Fourierist movement experiencing a brief [[boom and bust|boom]] in the United States during the middle years of the 1840s, when some 30 Fourierist associations were established.&lt;ref&gt;William Alfred Hinds, ''American Communities.'' Second edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on new religious movements ===
The Fourierist doctrine of attractions, correspondences, and analogies was identified with esoteric doctrines like [[Martinism]] by Fourierist like Just Muiron from an early point on.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, ''Sozialismus'', pp. 122-127; Beecher, ''Charles Fourier'', pp. 160-167.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder, then, that contemporary observers like Louis Reybaud, the author of the first study of the socialists, perceived Fourierism and other [[Utopian socialism|early socialist schools]] in the context of mysticism, magic, kabbalah, or the occult sciences.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 105-115.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been shown that Fourierism exerted a decisive influence on new religious movements like [[Spiritualism]] or [[Occultism]] after 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, "Socialist Religion"; cf. Strube, ''Sozialismus'' and Monroe, ''Laboratories''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date, Fourierism had already coined the ideas of US-American spiritualist thinkers such as [[Andrew Jackson Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, ''Republic'', pp. 171-176, 208-218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], who is regarded as the founder of modern occultism, was a pronounced adherent of Fourierism in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 316-351.''&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early twentieth century, there was a strong Fourierist presence in French socialist-spiritualist circles.

A '''historic house''' generally meets several criteria before being listed by an official body as "historic." Generally the building is at least a certain age, depending on the rules for the individual list.  A second factor is that the building be in recognizably the same form as when it became historic.  Third is a requirement that either an event of historical importance happened at the site, or that a person of historical significance was associated with the site, or that the building itself is important for its architecture or interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgiashpo.org/faq_what_makes_a_property_historic |publisher=Georgia Department of Natural Resources |title=What makes a property historic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Houses were first thought of as ''historic'' rather than just ''old'' or ''interesting'', during the early nineteenth century.  Government protection was first given during the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Elizabeth|title=A History of Historic House Reconstruction: Understanding the Past and Informing the Future|journal=Internet Archaeology|year=2011|volume=29|doi=10.11141/ia.29.3|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic homes are often eligible for special grant awards for preservation. What makes a historic home significant is often its architecture or its significance to the culture or history of the area. There are some organizations that offer services to research the history of a home and others that provide repositories for users to document the history of their homes.

Historic homes may still be inhabited, and thus should not be confused with [[historic house museums]].

== Historic houses in the United States ==
Houses are increasingly being designated as historic in the United States as a way to resuscitate neighbourhoods and increase the economic health of surrounding urban areas.&lt;ref name=coulson&gt;{{cite journal |via=[[Springer Science+Business Media|SpringerLink]]|last1=Coulson |first1=Edouard N. |last2=Leichenko |first2=Robin M. |year=2001 |title=The Internal and External Impact of Historical Designation on Property Values |journal=Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1023/A:1011120908836 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designating a house as historic tends to increase the value of the house as well as others in the same neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=coulson /&gt;&lt;ref name=narwold&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Narwold |first1=Andrew |last2=Sandy |first2=Jonathan |last3=Tu |first3=Charles |year=2008 |title=Historic Designation and Residential Property Values |url=http://www.umac.mo/fba/irer/papers/current/vol11n1_pdf/Article%204.pdf |journal=International Real Estate Review |publisher= |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=83–95 |access-date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in increased development of nearby properties, creating a ripple effect that spreads to surrounding neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=zahirovic-herbert&gt;{{cite journal |via=[[Springer Science+Business Media|SpringerLink]]|last1=Zahirovic-Herbert |first1=Velma |last2=Gibler |first2=Karen M. |date=January 2014 |title=Historic District Influence on House Prices and Marketing Duration |journal=The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=112–131 |doi=10.1007/s11146-012-9380-1 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, fees are assessed of homeowners during the designation process, so there is not necessarily an economic benefit to doing so.&lt;ref name=coulson /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">'''''Historiography and Historiophoty''''' is the name of an essay by historian and literary critic [[Hayden White]] first published in 1988 in ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. In the essay Hayden coins the term '''Historiophoty''' to describe the "representation of history and our thought about it in visual images and filmic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden says historiophoty "..is in contrast to [[Historiography]] which is the representation of history in verbal images and written discourse,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayden originally coined the term as a rhetorical device in response to an essay by [[Robert A. Rosenstone]] in the same issue of ''AHR'' entitled "History in images/History in words: Reflections on the possibility of really putting history onto film". Hayden, for the sake of exploring Rosenstone's premise (that history can be portrayed on film), created the term historiophoty as a description of the study of history through film. White was not necessarily claiming that historiophoty exists, or that it ought to; his essay was a [[thought experiment]] on what historiophoty would be like if in fact such a thing did exist.

Whatever Hayden's intention, since the publication of his 1988 essay the word historiophoty has entered into public and professional discourse. For example Brian Le Beau wrote "Historiography Meets Historiophoty: The Perils and Promise of Rendering the Past on Film" in ''American Studies'' Volume 38, no. 1 (Spring 1997) [http://www.ku.edu/~amerstud/1997.spring.html]. A book has been published titled ''History of Western Historiography, History of England, Historiophoty'' by Chou, Liang-kai.

== Modern Albanian historiography ==

There are two main sources of modern Albanian [[historiography]]: intellectuals from the [[Albanian National Awakening]] (''Rilindja'') period and historians from the regime of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=40}}{{quote|Modern Albanian historiography has two important sources: the thinkers of the 'renaissance' (rilindja) period (1844-1912), and the historians of the Communist regime.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 onward, the national Awakening period galvanised Albanian intellectuals among some who emerged as the first modern Albanian scholars and  they were preoccupied with overcoming linguistic and cultural differences between Albanian subgroups (Gegs and Tosks) and religious divisions (Muslim and Christians).&lt;ref name="Kostov40"/&gt; At that time, these scholars lacked access to many primary sources to construct the idea that Albanians were descendants of Illyrians, while Greater Albania was not considered a priority.&lt;ref name="Kostov40"/&gt; Compared with their Balkan counterparts, these Albanian historians were very moderate and alongside politicians mainly had the goal to get socio-political recognition and autonomy for Albanians under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="Kostov40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostov|first=Chris|title=Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto 1900-1996|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783034301961|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Serb+historians+illyrians#v=onepage&amp;q=Rilindja&amp;f=false|pages=40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major historical works written by Albanians during this early phase of modern historiography within Albania are Athanase Gegaj's ''L'Albanie et l'Invasion turque au XVe siècle'' (1937) and [[Fan Noli|Fan Noli's]] ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg (1405-1468)'' (1947), both written outside Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gran|first=Peter|title=Beyond Eurocentrism: A New View of Modern World History|year=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albanian socialist historiography (1945-1992) ===
Albanian socialist historiography was associated with the Albanian state building project of national legitimation.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Albanian historiography was based upon the works of a group of Albanian speaking intelligentsia that during the early to mid 19th century developed a national narrative when professional Albanian historians did not exist.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Balanced approaches to history were not encouraged during the period between the end of [[World War II]] and the death of [[Enver Hohxa]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Fischer281"/&gt; After the Second World War the communist government trained scholars to become historians and write Albanian history, while due to the political context they were preoccupied with matters relating to national identity.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt;  In 1959, the first volume on the history of Albania was published that dealt with topics ranging from antiquity until the 19th century and was a major undertaking that was a serious analysis of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Ottoman sources.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Elements of national construction dominated parts of the work such as stressing the Illyrians as the ancestors of the Albanians, the existence of an Albanian medieval state and that Albanians during the Ottoman period were an autonomous entity.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; These themes though linked to matters of national identification were not completely unfounded.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; During the communist period, the regime attempted to instill a national consciousness through the scope of a teleological past based upon Illyrian descent, Skanderbeg's resistance to the Ottomans and the nationalist reawakening (''Rilindja'') of the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke14"/&gt; Those themes and concepts of history have still continued within a post-communist environment modified and adapted to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke14"/&gt; Albanian historiographical scholarship though compromised by political influences did manage to produce reliable information at times.
&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"&gt;{{harvnb|Di Lellio|2009|p=11}}. "The development of an Albanian scholarly tradition of historians is relatively recent and tightly linked to a project of national legitimation. While a loose international network of Albanian-speaking intellectuals began to develop a national narrative in the first half of the 19th century, professional historians were absent. Only after WWII did the Enver Hoxha regime start to train the scholars who would take up the task of writing Albanian history and, from the outset, the profession was strongly influenced by an authoritarian project of state building; political circumstances kept Albanian historians absorbed by issues of national identity. This does not mean that their work does not yield reliable information. The first volume of the history of Albania that first appeared in 1959 concerns the period from antiquity through the mid-19th century and is a major enterprise based on a serious examination of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Turkish sources. Its emphasis on the autochthonous character of the Albanians as the sole descendants of the Illyrians and on the existence of an Albanian state in the XII century; and the insistence on the Albanian nation as an autonomous entity during the Ottoman epoch, are all elements of a national construction and in the end inseparable from the process of national identification, but not entirely without foundation."&lt;/ref&gt; Of Stalinist Albania, [[Bernd Jürgen Fischer]] stated that it produced good historians though not always good history.&lt;ref name="Fischer281"&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}{{quote|The political climate in Albania under Enver Hoxha, who ruled Albania from World War II until his death in 1985, did little to encourage a balanced approach to history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing upon themes of national struggles established during the Rilindja period, Albanian socialist historiography centred itself upon the main narrative of nationhood that within history writing included Marxist historical materialism and nationalism.&lt;ref name="Brisku16"/&gt; There were two main notable groups of Albanian historians in that period:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Military historians: Ndreci Plasari and Shyqri Ballvora
# Political historians: [[Alex Buda]], Stefanaq Pollo, Arben Puto and Luan Omari.

Alex Buda, who also became a president of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]], is sometimes considered as a founder of the Albanian post WWII historiography.&lt;ref name="Keber2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda|last2=Keber|first2=Katarina|title=Historièni seminar 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFKZ_D8_Y6AC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Založba ZRC|isbn=978-961-254-216-0|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buda belonged to a small group of intellectuals allowed by the Albanian communist regime to have access to foreign literature in order to use them to prepare new ideological and theoretical directives for the rest of their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Keber2010-2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda|last2=Keber|first2=Katarina|title=Historièni seminar 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFKZ_D8_Y6AC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Založba ZRC|isbn=978-961-254-216-0|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post communist Albanian Historiography ===

When Albanian socialist historiography dealt with people, it tended to see things black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}{{quote|...socialist Albanian historiography tends, when dealing with people, to see things in black and white terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of understanding history through such dichotomies has remained for a majority of Albanians which for example they view Skanderbeg and the anti-Ottoman forces as "good" while the Ottomans are "bad".&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"/&gt; The influence of ideology upon Albanian historians during the socialist era of Albanian Historiography can be seen not only in publications published by [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]] (i.e. ''Historia e Shqipërisë'') but also in specialized works published by individual authors like Viron Koka, Mentar Belegu and Ilijaz Fishta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ilirjani |first= Altin |author2= Arolda Elbasani, Ridvan Peshkopia  |author-separator= |editor= |editor2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor-link= |editor2-link= |others= |title=Albanian Journal of Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_TKBd1prK0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=historiography+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=historiography%20albania&amp;f=false |volume=1  |year=2010 |publisher= Shoqata Shqiptare e Shkencave Politike |location=Chapel Hill, NC |language= |isbn= 9780977666225|oclc=70817932 |page=178 |quote=... the ideologically tingled historiography of socialist-era Albanian historians, as evidenced not only in official publications issued by the Academy of Sciences of Albania, like in....Historia e Shqipërisë, but also in more specialized works by authors such as...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to that legacy, [[Robert Elsie]] emphasized that there was no reliable and objective historiography in Albania which could serve as a basis for his historical dictionary of Albania he compiled and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|p=xi}}{{quote|...Compiling a historical dictionary for a country... as Albania... because there is still no objective and reliable historiography in Albania.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Jens Schmitt]] stated that the post-World War II Albanian regime propagated the official version of the past using all available means. People in Albania were subjected to state organized indoctrination and propaganda. Schmitt explained that because of political influence it was impossible to organize open discussion about socialist historiography, while those who attempted to criticize it would be denounced often as non-professionals or foreigners with evil objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jens|first=Oliver|author2=Ben Andoni|title=Historia shqiptare-një histori e hapur|journal=ResPublica|url=http://respublica.al/opinion/2013/02/11/historia-shqiptare-nje-histori-e-hapur|accessdate=6 February 2014|language=Albanian|year=2013|quote=Mbas 1945, për herë të parë në historinë e Shqipërisë, Shteti përdorte të gjitha mjetet e tij për të prodhuar dhe propaganduar versionin e tij zyrtar të së shkuarës.

== Themes ==

=== Early Albanian history ===
{{Main article|Origin of the Albanians}}

The picture created by [[Science and technology in Albania|Albanian science]] about the early history of [[Albanians]] is simplified, uncritical and has appearances of fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartl|2001|p=17}}{{quote|Слика коју албанска наука ствара о раној историјисопственог народа је поједностављена, некритичка и делује исконструисано.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian scholars have continuously asserted and claimed antecedence of [[Albanian culture]] over [[Slavic culture|Slav culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2004|p=xvii}}{{quote|Albanian scholars ever ready to assert antecedence of their culture over that of the Slavs }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Albanian historiography, which influenced many Albanians, emphasizes that Albanians have always lived in Albania and supports the hypothesis that Albanians are descendants of [[Illyrians]], while some non-Albanian scholars consider the question of the origin of Albanians to be unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|The official historiography claims that Albanians have always lived in Albania and therefore gives credit to the thesis that they are the descendants of the Illyrians...However, non-Albanian researchers consider the question of Illyrian or Thracian origin of the Albanians to be unsolved...Nevertheless, this version of history has influenced many Albanians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman period and Islam in Albania ===
{{Main article|Islamization of Albania|Islam in Albania#Debates about Islam and contemporary Albanian identity}}

The image of [[Islam]] produced by both main sources of modern Albanian historiography was neither objective nor positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=40}}{{quote|Neither of them produced an objective and positive image of Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Albanian Communists|communist]] [[Fall of communism in Albania|regime fell]] (1992) in Albania, contemporary Albanian historians have still held onto inherited [[stereotypes]] and [[myths]] regarding Islam from Albanian socialist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|Since the fall of Communism, Albanian historians have not started to free themselves from their inherited stereotypes. This explains why contemporary history, when it comes to Islam, is still the prisoner of myths.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian historiographical myths regarding Islam include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|One of these myths is that Islam is an alien element of Albanian culture imported by the Ottomans. The reason is that Albanians were originally Christian (Saint Paul visited Illyria). Other myths say that they had converted for a number of reasons which had nothing to do with religion. They were opportunists. They wanted to escape the taxes imposed on Christians and to benefit from the many advantages attached to being Muslim in a Muslim society. It is said also that they were forced by the Ottomans to embrace Islam. Those who converted are often presented as traitors to the true spirit of the nation. Another important myth is the weakness of Albanians’ religious feeling. Communists worked hard to show that in their history national feeling was always more important for Albanians than religious feeling. In their propaganda, they did not hesitate to distort the ideas of the rilindja writers. As an example, they used - out of context - the famous declaration of Pashko Vasa Shkodrani: ‘The religion of the Albanians is Albanianism’. Actually, he wanted to encourage national unity while still respecting each person’s religious belief.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Islam was imported by the [[Ottomans]] and is an alien element of Albanian culture.
# Albanians converted from [[Christianity]] to Islam not because of their religious feelings though instead for other opportunistic reasons or because they were sometimes forced to do so.
# Albanian religious sentiments are weak because Albanian national feeling was always more important for Albanians than their religious adherence and affiliations.

Numerous historians from Albania with nationalist perspectives (Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto) intentionally emphasized "the Turkish savagery" and "heroic Christian resistance against the Osmanli state in Albania".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kopanski|1997|p=192}}{{quote|Albanian nationalist historians like Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto in their books deliberately emphasized "the Turkish savagery" and "heroic Christian resistance against the 
Osmanli state in Albania".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian historiography tends to ignore religiously inspired enmity between Albanians of different faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwandner-Sievers|2002|p=62}}{{quote|...there are many instances of religiously inspired animosities, which present day Albanian historiography tends to ignore.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trends from Albanian nationalist historiography composed by scholars during and of the communist era onward linger on that interpret Ottoman rule as being the "yoke" period, akin to other Balkan historiographies.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Neke|2014|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skanderbeg ===

Although the [[Myth of Skanderbeg]] had little to do with the reality of historical Skanderbeg, it was incorporated in works about [[history of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Bartl |first= Peter |author= |authorlink= |author-separator= |editor= |editor2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor-link= |editor2-link= |others= |title=Bartl, Peter: review of: Schmitt, Oliver Jens, Skanderbeg.

=== Treaty of London ===
{{Main article|Treaty of London (1913)}}

The Treaty of London interpreted by nationalist Albanian historiography symbolizes the partition of the Albanian nation into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ersoy |first= Ahmet |author2= Maciej Górny; Vangelis Kechriotis |title=Modernism : the creation of nation-states |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j-Uemo6SfoC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=historiography+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=historiography%20albania&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher=Central European University Press |location= Budapest ; New York  |isbn=9781441684110  |oclc=699519530 |pages=236, 237 |quote=Decisions of the London ...In nationalist Albanian historiography, this symbolizes the partition of the nation into three parts; Kosovo was annexed by Serbia, Çamëria (Gr.

A '''hydraulic empire''' (also known as a '''hydraulic despotism''', or '''water monopoly empire''') is a social or government structure which maintains power and control through exclusive control over access to water. It arises through the need for [[flood]] control and [[irrigation]], which requires central coordination and a specialized [[bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name="Wittfogel"&gt;{{cite book

Often associated with these terms and concepts is the notion of a ''water dynasty''. This body is a political structure which is commonly characterized by a system of hierarchy and control often based on class or caste. Power, both over resources (food, water, energy) and a means of enforcement such as the military are vital for the maintenance of control.

== Civilizations ==

A developed hydraulic civilization maintains control over its population by means of controlling the supply of water. The term was coined by the [[German-American]] historian [[Karl August Wittfogel]] (1896–1988), in his book ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]'' (1957). Wittfogel asserted that such "hydraulic civilizations"—although they were neither all located in the Orient nor characteristic of all Oriental societies—were essentially different from those of the Western world.

Most of the [[first civilization]]s in history, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[History of Somalia#Ancient|Ancient Somalia]], Sri Lanka, [[Mesopotamia]], China and [[Pre-Columbian Mexico]] and [[Pre-Columbian Peru|Peru]], are believed to have been hydraulic empires.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The [[Indus Valley civilization]] is often considered a hydraulic empire despite a lack of evidence of irrigation (as this evidence may have been lost in time due to flood damage).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Most hydraulic empires existed in arid or [[desert]] regions, but imperial China also had some such characteristics, due to the exacting needs of rice cultivation.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate]] of the [[Horn of Africa]] was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River]]s.  Through [[hydraulic engineering]], it also constructed many of the [[limestone]] [[Water well|wells]] and [[cistern]]s of the state that are still operative and in use today.  Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="His 40"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The History of Somalia |page=26 |accessdate=2014-02-14|isbn=9780313378577 |last1=Njoku |first1=Raphael Chijioke |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
Wittfogel argues that climate caused some parts of the world to develop higher levels of civilization than others. He is known for claiming that climate in the Orient led to despotic rule. This environmental determinism comes to bear when considering that in those societies where the most control was exhibited, this was commonly the case due to the central role of the resource in economic processes and its environmentally limited, or constrained nature. This made controlling supply and demand easier and allowed a more complete monopoly to be established, as well as preventing the use of alternative resources to compensate. However, Diamond {{Reference or Citation needed|date=October 2018}} points out that complex irrigation projects predated states in Madagascar, Mexico, China and Mesopotamia.

The typical hydraulic empire government, in Wittfogel's thesis, is extremely centralized, with no trace of an independent aristocracy – in contrast to the decentralized [[feudalism]] of medieval Europe. Though tribal societies had structures that were usually personal in nature, exercised by a patriarch over a tribal group related by various degrees of kinship, hydraulic hierarchies gave rise to the established permanent institution of impersonal government. Popular revolution in such a state was impossible: a dynasty might die out or be overthrown by force, but the new regime would differ very little from the old one. Hydraulic empires were only ever destroyed by foreign conquerors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
 
Wittfogel's ideas, when applied to China, have been harshly criticized by scholars such as [[Joseph Needham]] who argued essentially that Wittfogel was operating from ignorance of basic [[History of China|Chinese history]]. Needham argued that the Chinese government was not despotic, was not dominated by a priesthood, had lots of peasant rebellions, and that Wittfogel's perspective does not address the necessity and presence of bureaucracy in modern Western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Robert L. Carneiro]] was also critical of Wittfogel's theory, writing in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in August 1970: "This theory has recently run into difficulties.  Archeological evidence now makes it appear that in at least three of the areas that Wittfogel cites as exemplifying his "hydraulic hypothesis"—Mesopotamia, China, and Mexico—full-fledged states developed well before large-scale irrigation".&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carneiro |first= Robert L. |title= A Theory of the Origin of the State |url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/carneirooriginstate.htm | date=21 August 1970|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=169|issue= 3947|pages= 733–738  |accessdate=29 April 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733 |pmid=17820299}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Mesopotamia]], Carneiro cited [[Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.]], who had concluded: "In short, there is nothing to suggest that the rise of dynastic authority in southern Mesopotamia was linked to the administrative requirements of a major canal system."&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="City Invincible"&gt;{{cite book| editor1 = Carl Hermann Kraeling | editor2= Robert M.

Raymond Rudorff |title= Ancient China From the Beginnings to the Empire | date = 1968| publisher = Faber and Faber | location= London| page = 92| asin= B000BWHHEY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning to Mexico, Carneiro wrote: “large-scale irrigation systems do not appear to antedate the Classic period, whereas it is clear that the first states arose in the preceding Formative or Pre-Classic period”.&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt; Of hydraulic empires generally, Carneiro commented: "This is not to say, of course, that large-scale irrigation, where it occurred, did not contribute significantly to increasing the power and scope of the state.  It unquestionably did.  To the extent that Wittfogel limits himself to this contention, I have no quarrel with him whatever.  However, the point at issue is not how the state increased its power but how it arose in the first place.  And to this issue the hydraulic hypothesis does not appear to hold the key."&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt;

The same elements of resource control central to hydraulic empire were also central to Europe's colonization of much of the global South. Colonies were resource rich areas located on the periphery, and the contemporary models of core-periphery interaction were focused on the extraction and control of these resources for the use of the core.&lt;ref&gt;Myrdal, Gunner. 1957.

Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished through a type of agro-managerial despotism with close connections to debates around hydraulic empire.

*The protagonist in Larry Niven's ''[[A World Out of Time]]'' (1976) describes the concept of a water-monopoly empire to the antagonist. This becomes a major plot point.  In his book ''[[Destiny's Road]]'' (1998), potassium (a trace nutrient) takes the place of water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}
*In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s novel ''[[Drakon (novel)|Drakon]]'' (1996), the ''drakensis'' Gwendolyn Ingolfson comments on  Wittfogel's ''[[Karl August Wittfogel#The Asiatic Mode of Production|Oriental Despotism]]'': "Interesting analysis. Very acute…my ancestors would probably have killed him."
* In the ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' science fiction series, created by [[Frank Herbert]], water is a source of power and contention on the desert planet [[Arrakis]].  More importantly, a drug called [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], found only on that planet, is the key commodity in interplanetary commerce.  This makes whoever controls Arrakis ruler of a hydraulic empire on Arrakis and, by effect, the empire of the entire known universe.  At many places in the books some variant of the following is said of melange: "He who controls it, controls our destiny."
* In the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', the primary antagonist Dominic Greene plots a coup d'état in [[Bolivia]] in order to seize control of its water supply.
* The leader of a small bastion of post-apocalyptic human activity in ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' has founded and maintained dominion of his town—and plans to expand his power—through the control of rare underground springs that only he knows about.
* One of the faction leaders of ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', Mr. House, holds a grip over another faction, the [[New California Republic]], with a one-sided deal where the NCR maintains and protects Hoover Dam while he gets more than enough free energy and water to maintain New Vegas.
* The cult-leader Immortan Joe from ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' has monopolized fresh water resources extracted from deep underground, using it as a mechanism of control and for hydroponic agriculture in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.
* The fifth episode of the third season of the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' television series, titled "The Execution", the Impossible Mission Force must stop a gangster from taking over the food distribution throughout the United States.
* The mega-corporation Water and Power from ''[[Tank Girl]]'' hunts down and imprisons or kills anyone caught with a well or other means of obtaining water on their own.
* The main antagonist of ''[[Turbo Kid]]'' kills anyone he finds out is obtaining fresh water within his domain without his permission.
* In [[The_Expanse_(TV_series)|The Expanse]] 'Belters', who live in various space stations and small moons and asteroids throughout the solar system rely on imported water and air and are subject to rationing as a form of social pacification.

The '''Institut Nova Història''' (INH) is a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cultural [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] with headquarters in [[Barcelona]]. Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer [[Jordi Bilbeny]], hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or "Castilian") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. They claim that major historical figures, including [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] and others were Catalan. The institute's work has been criticised as [[pseudohistory]].

The institute promotes research, study and dissemination of ideas about Catalan influence on history through publications, conferences and symposia, in particular the annual "Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America" in [[Arenys de Munt]]. It is funded by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan autonomous government]], and has received support from [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] politicians.

The INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish ("Castilian") state. By minimising the role of Catalonia—or the [[Crown of Aragon]]—in Spanish collective history through falsification, concealment and censorship or "appropriation" of certain historical episodes, the prevalence of Castilian ideology is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pere Forès i Malleu|first=Pere|title = Esborrant la traça catalana|magazine=Presència|location=Barcelona|number=2021|date=19 November 2010|pages=28–31|id= GI-143-1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its claims are:

A history rewritten by the Castilians'', noting that the books published by the INH "are very convincing", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, [[Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira]], participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's ''Brief account of the destruction of history'', where he spoke in praise of the book.&lt;ref name=EC140804&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernández|first=A.|title=Jordi Pujol y Carod se suman a la teoría de que Colón y los Pinzón eran catalanes|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2014-07-03/jordi-pujol-y-carod-se-suman-a-la-teoria-de-que-colon-y-los-pinzon-eran-catalanes_155815/|work=El Confidencial|date=3 July 2014|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 INH symposium in [[Arenys de Munt]], under the title "The Catalan Discovery of America", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and [[Arenys de Mar]], together with associations such as the {{lang|ca|Ateneu Independentista}} of Arenys de Munt. [[Muriel Casals i Couturier|Muriel Casals]], representative of the separatist coalition [[Junts pel Sí]], gave the closing speech entitled "From the erased past to political independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruiz Coll|first=M.A.|title=ERC reúne a 40 historiadores con dinero público para demostrar que Da Vinci, Marco Polo, Colón y Cervantes eran catalanes|url=https://okdiario.com/espana/cataluna/2015/11/25/erc-reune-a-40-historiadores-con-dinero-publico-para-demostrar-que-da-vinci-marco-polo-colon-y-cervantes-eran-catalanes-28378|work=ok diario| language=Spanish|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INH members have given talks on their theories in the main Catalan government-owned television and radio channels such as [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] and [[Catalunya Ràdio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/el-documental/desmuntant-leonardo/video/5561885/|title=Desmuntant Leonardo|author=[[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prkiy0K0Cuk|publisher=youtube|title=Entrevista Mònica Terribas: Bilbeny/Grau (1/4) histocat.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Punt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cat Radio"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The INH has been described by one academic as "a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile".&lt;ref name=Rodríguez&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodríguez López-Abadía |first=Arturo |date=2014 |title=The origins of Christopher Columbus, a never-ending controversy |url=https://www.academia.edu/9952462/The_origins_of_Christopher_Columbus_a_never-ending_controversy |journal=Revista Internacional Digilec|volume=Vol. 1|number=1|pages=1 to 10 |issn=2386-6691|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sallés|first=Quico|title = C's: «És ridícul dir que Cristòfol Colom és català»|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/67614/es/ridicul/dir/cristofol/colom/catala|work= NacióDigital.cat|date =22 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javier Barraycoa, vice-chancellor of the [[Abat Oliba CEU University]], former secretary of the {{ill|Carlist Traditionalist Communion|ca|Comunió Tradicionalista Carlista}} in Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Directorio General de la Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|url=http://www.carlistas.es/descargas/organigrama.pdf|website=Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista| language=Spanish|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the anti-Catalanist organisation [[Somatemps]], said that the INH "has absolutely no recognition in the academic world" and that its members "have not been invited to any serious congress because it is impossible for them to defend these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Rosalina|title=Barraycoa: ‘Cataluña vive un delirio colectivo’|url=http://www.gaceta.es/noticias/cataluna-vive-delirio-colectivo-10072014-1128|work=La Gaceta |date=10 July 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

Pp. 12"/&gt; In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed "Marxist" [[Paul Lafargue]], by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered "Marxist", then "one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010.

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

{{quote box|quote=Marxism taught me what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn't even know where north or south is.

This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is property of the society as whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoDickson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Hugo-Chavéz Vota.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chavez]] casting a vote in 2007 ]]
[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Criticisms of socialism|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal.

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Human history}}
'''Modern history''', the '''modern period''' or the '''modern era''', is the linear, global, [[historiography|historiographical]] approach to the time frame after [[post-classical history]].&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the [[English language]], "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval; modern history is the history of the world since the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814|title=The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia|publisher=|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into periods:

In the pre-modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a [[faith]] in some form of [[deity]], be it that in a single [[God]] or in many [[gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Tirosh-Samuelson, H.

Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person.

[[Tradition]] was [[sacred]] to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the [[social order]] of [[ceremony]] and [[morals]] in a culture could be strictly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H.S., &amp; Dwight, T.W.

===Modern===

The term ''modern'' was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times (ultimately derived from the Latin adverb ''modo'', meaning "just now").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/modern|website=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[Renaissance]] (c. 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and Early Modern times, started in Italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the [[Age of Discovery]] and the invention of the [[telescope]] and [[microscope]], expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.

In contrast to the pre-modern era, [[Western world|Western civilization]] made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when [[scientific method]]s were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of [[mythology|myth]] under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via [[empirical observation]],&lt;ref&gt;Baird, F.E., &amp; Kaufmann, W.A. (2008). ''Philosophic classics: From Plato to Derrida''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; versus the historic use of [[reason]] and [[innate knowledge]].

The term ''Early Modern'' was introduced in the English language in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of the History of ideas'', Volume 5, Detroit 2005. Modernism and Modern&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the time between what has been called the [[Middle Ages]] and time of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (1800) (when the meaning of the term ''Modern Ages'' was developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms stem from European history. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in Asia, and in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], the terms are applied in a very different way, but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_14.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Late Medieval and Early Modern Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary ===

{{Main|Contemporary history}}
In the Contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the [[Information Age]] and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life. The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the [[European Union]] and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] were two forces recently developed. A concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.

== Modern era ==
=== Significant developments ===

The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of [[science]], [[politics]], [[warfare]], and [[technology]]. It has also been an [[age of discovery]] and [[globalization]]. During this time, the [[power (international)|European powers]] and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural [[colonization]] of the rest of the world.

By the late 19th and 20th centuries, [[modernist]] art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]], but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of [[individualism]],&lt;ref name="NCEref"&gt;''National, cultural, and ethnic identities: harmony beyond conflict'' by Jaroslav Hroch, David Hollan&lt;/ref&gt; [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism and modernity: the great debate'' by Jack Goody&lt;/ref&gt; [[urbanization]]&lt;ref name="NCEref" /&gt; and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9Ha1fmAXk4C ''Progress and its discontents''] American Academy of Arts and Sciences. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ov86j30F96EC&amp;pg=PA297 Technology and politics]." Western Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to the philosophy of technology'' by Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen, Stig Andur Pedersen, Vincent F. Hendricks&lt;/ref&gt;

Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx, Durkheim, Weber: formations of modern social thought'' by Kenneth L. Morrison. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Schweiker, ''The Blackwell companion to religious ethics''. 2005. p. 454. (cf., "In modernity, however, much of economic activity and theory seemed to be entirely cut off from religious and ethical norms, at least in traditional terms. Many see modern economic developments as entirely secular.")&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by [[postmodernism]] while the dominance of Western Europe and [[Anglo-America]] over other continents has been criticized by [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]].

One common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of [[movable type]]&lt;ref&gt;''Early European History'' by [[Henry Kitchell Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformations'' by [[Carter Lindberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the "modern" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''The new Cambridge modern history: Companion volume'' by Peter Burke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Plains Indian History and Culture: Essays on Continuity and Change'' by John C. Ewers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weber, irrationality, and social order'' by Alan Sica&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early ====
{{Main|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* The [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* The Rise of [[capitalism]]
* The [[Golden Age of Piracy]]

Important events in the early modern period include:
* The invention of the [[printing press]]
* The [[English Civil War]]
* The [[Seven Years' War]]

|&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Modern Age characteristics&lt;/div&gt;
The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient or medieval world rests on a sense that the modern world is not just another [[era]] in history, but rather the result of a new type of change. This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation.

Advances in all areas of human activity—[[politics]], [[industry]], [[society]], [[economics]], [[commerce]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[mechanization]], [[automation]], [[science]], [[medicine]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]—appear to have transformed an ''Old World'' into the ''Modern'' or ''New World''.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern"&gt;''Contemporary history of the world'' by Edwin Augustus Grosvenor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson"&gt;''A summary of modern history'' by Jules Michelet, Mary Charlotte Mair Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old-fashioned from the modern.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;

This combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.

As an [[Age of Revolution]]s dawned, beginning with those revolts in [[American Revolution|America]] and [[French Revolution|France]], political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, C.W.

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the peace established by [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Charles Downer (1910).

==== Late ====
As a result of the Industrial Revolution and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]
* [[Total fertility rate]]s and [[ecological collapse]]s occurring at [[exponential growth|geometric rates]];

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[American Revolution]]
* The [[French Revolution]]
* The [[Colonization of Australia]]
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]
* The [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]

== Early modern period ==
{{Main|Early modern period}}
Historians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800. It follows the Late Middle Ages and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.

The expansion of Islam took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mughal Empire]] existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.

Various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. In the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Empire]] and cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. In the west, kingdoms of Europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion. Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.

Later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned Muslim expansion. Christians and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and the [[Protestant Reformation]] took place.
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|centre|thumb|upright=3.4|{{center|Colonial empires in 1800}}]]
During the early modern period, an [[age of discovery]] and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.

In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the later Ming Dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1000ce_mingvoyages.htm#decision|title=The Ming Voyages {{!}} Asia for Educators {{!}} Columbia University|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite isolationist policies the Ming Economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as [[Portuguese Macau|Macao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115ch8.html|title=Chapter 8 The New World|website=mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect [[Joseon|Korea]] from [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=168–169|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] dynasty, by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]]. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, "A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

==== Japan ====
{{Main|Edo period}}
[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], art flourished in the Edo Period]]
In pre-modern&lt;ref&gt;or early-modern&lt;/ref&gt; Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of "warring states", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[shōgun]]'' in 1603.
Society in the Japanese "[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimyōs'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimyōs'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.

===== British and Dutch colonization =====

The development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]

The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] and consequent of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the [[India Office|British government]] assumed the task of directly administering India in the new [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 [[Stamford Raffles]] established [[Singapore]] as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.
[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]
In 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

==== Reason and Enlightenment ====
{{Further|Great Divergence}}
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|left|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach – Mass in B minor – Agnus Dei, From 1724]]
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright=1|"If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it." An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]] (center) is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]|alt=]]

Traditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The [[Age of Reason]] in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of [[modern philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; and a departure from the medieval approach, especially [[Scholasticism]]. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] is a time in [[Western philosophy]] and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of [[scholasticism]] with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-consciously imitated [[classical Latin]] and deprecated the use of [[medieval Latin]]. By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning.[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.|alt=|147x147px|left]]The [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] was a [[literature|literary]] and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the [[Académie française]]. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (''Anciens'') who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the Moderns (''Modernes''), who supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

==== Scientific Revolution ====
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
The Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in [[classical physics]], [[classical astronomy|astronomy]], [[classical biology|biology]], [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|human anatomy]], [[classical chemistry|chemistry]], and other [[classical science]]s were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from [[Ancient Greece]] to the Middle Ages which would lead to a transition to [[modern science]]. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]], in institutions supporting [[scientific investigation]], and in the more [[worldview|widely held picture of the universe]]. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.

==== The French Revolutions ====
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''La liberté guidant le peuple''. The [[French Revolution]] inspired a wave of revolutions across Europe. [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]
{{Main|French Revolution}}
Toward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, changing to forms based on Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].

The changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.

===== National and Legislative Assembly =====
{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)|Legislative Assembly (France)}}
During the French Revolution, the National Assembly, which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.

===== The Directory and Napoleonic Era =====
[[File:Baron Antoine-Jean Gros-Battle Pyramids 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] 1810 by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros]]
{{Main|French Directory|Napoleonic Era}}
The Executive Directory was a body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. Napoleon, before seizing the title of Emperor, was elected as First Consul of the Consulate of France.

The campaigns of French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte characterized the Napoleonic Era. Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and "Glorious" surge of [[Republicanism]].

==== Italian unification ====
[[File:Gioacchino toma roma o morte 1863.jpg|left|thumb|''Rome or Death,'' Italian Patriotic Painting, 1863]]

[[Italian unification]] was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, and approximately ended with the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, though the last ''[[Italia irredenta|città irredente]]'' did not join the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] until after World War I.

==== End of the early modern period ====
Toward the end of the early modern period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later.

The end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern Europe.

=== North America ===
{{Main|European colonization of the Americas}}[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the five-man committee in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]

The [[French and Indian Wars]] were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other.

The expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war, there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (also called American War of Independence).

The American Revolution began with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claim to the United States with the Treaty of Paris.

The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set up the current United States; the [[United States Constitution]] ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.

==== Decolonization of North and South Americas ====
{{Main|Decolonization of the Americas|Spanish American wars of independence}}The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the [[Empire of Brazil]].

=== Industrial revolutions ===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM]]

The development of the [[steam engine]] started the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Watt steam engine]] image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM ([[Madrid]])&lt;/ref&gt; The steam engine was created to pump water from coal mines, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels. The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that it "broke out" in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd.  {{ISBN|0349104840}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[T.S. Ashton]] held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], The [[English Regency|Regency]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E Inikori.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521010799&amp;id=y7rhKYWhCyIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;sig=zOPr9UkQv258KyhCkuFM0abERnI  ''Africans and the Industrial Revolution in England''], Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521010799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The great changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas, religion or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people.

The first Industrial Revolution merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[electric power]] generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.

==== Industrialization ====
[[Industrialization]] is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It is a subdivision of a more general [[modernization]] process, where [[social change]] and [[economic development]] are closely related with [[innovation|technological innovation]], particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their [[nature|perception of nature]].

==== Revolution in manufacture and power ====
[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|[[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830, world's first railway.]]
An [[economic system|economy]] based on [[manual labour]] was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the [[textile]] industries and the development of [[iron]]-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads, and then [[rail transport|railways]].

The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by [[coal]]) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Business and Economics.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0195115899&amp;id=CX9kBaVx4JkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=V0eO27c7koD8rrIV2EKv6-guB5s  ''Leading Issues in Economic Development''], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0195115899}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.

The modern [[petroleum industry]] started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining [[kerosene]] from [[coal]] by [[Nova Scotia]]n [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]]. [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil" ("petr-oleum") [[seep]]s in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the following year. In 1854, [[Benjamin Silliman]], a science professor at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.

==== Notable engineers ====
[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Nikola Tesla with his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York|alt=|193x193px]]

Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, [[Lewis Paul]] was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]]'s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.

In the latter part of the second revolution, [[Thomas Alva Edison]] developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched on the world's first large-scale [[electrical supply network]] that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, [[Nikola Tesla]] made many contributions in the field of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==== Social effects and classes ====
The Industrial Revolutions were major [[technology|technological]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], and [[culture|cultural]] changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on [[society]] was enormous and is often compared to the [[Neolithic revolution]], when mankind developed [[agriculture]] and gave up its [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Brown, Lester. [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1853839043&amp;id=5aCyfUsHM6kC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;sig=1dsUat9P_-9dWWVRMpPt1udT8DQ ''Eco-Economy''], James &amp; James, Earthscan. {{ISBN|1853839043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032512/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |date=2007-11-27 }} retrieved March 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mid-19th-century European revolts =====
[[File:Alexanderplatz Berlin 1848.jpg|left|thumb|[[Revolutions of 1848|German Revolution]], Berlin 1848]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]], known in some countries as the Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848, soon spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cayley, E.S. (1856). ''The European revolutions of 1848''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. Vol. I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, S.B., &amp; Hart, A.B. (1918). ''New medieval and modern history''. New York: American book company.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the revolutions were quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas, with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching.

===== Industrial age reformism =====
Industrial age [[reform movement]]s began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian, socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal reform, prison reform, and public sanitation.

Following the Enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the [[Scientific Revolution]] and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.

==== Imperial Russia ====
{{Main|Russian Empire}}

Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=978-5170021420|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's ''Window to Europe''. [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (''the Great''), who ruled in 1762–96, extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward and southward.  Russia would [[Russian conquest of Siberia|colonize]] the vast Asian lands of [[Siberia]] expanding by land to the Pacific Coast of Asia, and [[Russian America|North America]].  As the large realm embraced [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchy]] Russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors. In the 19th century, Russia was invaded by France in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards. Nonetheless industrialization did not come to Russia until the 1870s. The Medieval practice of serfdom was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished]] in 1861 freeing over thirty million Russian peasants. A market economy finally emerged in the Russian Empire. However class warfare rose, and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

=== European dominance and the 19th century ===
{{Main|19th century|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
Historians define the 19th century [[List of time periods|historical era]] as stretching from 1815 (the [[Congress of Vienna]]) to 1914 (the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]). Alternatively, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] defined the [[The long 19th century|"Long Nineteenth Century"]] as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.

In the 1800s and early 1900s, once great and powerful Empires such as Spain, Ottoman Turkey, the Mughal Empire, and the Kingdom of Portugal began to break apart. Spain, which was at one time unrivaled in Europe, had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Sensing the time was right, Spain's vast colonies in South America began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the Spanish territories gaining their independence.

The once mighty Ottoman Empire was wracked with a series of revolutions, resulting with the Ottoman's only holding a small region that surrounded the capital, Istanbul.

The Mughal empire, which was descended from the Mongol Khanate, was bested by the upcoming [[Maratha Confederacy]]. All was going well for the [[Maratha]]s until the British took an interest in the riches of India and the British ended up ruling not just the boundaries of Modern India, but also Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh and some Southern Regions of Afghanistan.

The King of Portugal's vast territory of Brazil reformed into the independent Empire of Brazil. With the defeat of Napoleonic France, Britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world, and by the end of the First World War controlled a Quarter of the world's population and a third of its surface. However, the power of the British Empire did not end on land, since it had the greatest navy on the planet. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to become a great [[Power (international)|international power]] that raced to create empires of its own.

The [[Meiji Restoration]] was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the [[Meiji Era]] which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] of [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and made [[Imperial Japan]] a [[great power]]. [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive [[rebellion]]s and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century.

European powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French [[New Caledonia]] from 1853 and [[French Polynesia]] from 1889; the Germans established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900. The United States expanded into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] from 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].

==== British Victorian era ====
{{Main|British Empire|Victorian era}}[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps|alt=|left]]The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]].

In Britain's "imperial century",&lt;ref&gt;For more, see [[Pax Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and a foreign policy of "[[splendid isolation]]". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been generally characterized as "[[informal empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. T. (2004). ''Informal empire: Mexico and Central America in Victorian culture''. Minneapolis, Minn: Univ. of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Of note during this time was the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the [[Zulu Empire]].

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]]. Growing until 1922, around {{convert|13000000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus (2001).

==== French governments and conflicts ====
The [[Bourbon Restoration]] followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The [[July Monarchy]] was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|left|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]]]]
The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a conflict between France and Prussia, while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was a member, and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.

The [[French Third Republic]] was the republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire following the defeat of Louis-Napoléon in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien Régime in the French Revolution of 1789.

==== Slavery and abolition ====
[[File:Une Dame d´une Fortune Ordinaire dans son Intérieur au Milieu de ses Habitudes Journalières, by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1823.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Slavery]] in [[Brazil]], before 1823]]
{{Main|Abolitionism}}
[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], Britain forced the [[Barbary pirates]] to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, [[Slavery Abolition Act|banned slavery throughout its domain]], and charged its navy with ending the global [[slave trade]]. Slavery was then abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]], [[Emancipation Proclamation|America]], and [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]].

==== African colonization ====
{{Main|Colonisation of Africa}}

Following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation, the [[Scramble for Africa]] was initiated formally at the [[Berlin West Africa Conference]] in 1884–1885. The Berlin Conference attempted to avoid war among the European powers by allowing the European rival countries to carve up the continent of Africa into national colonies. Africans were not consulted.

The major European powers laid claim to the areas of [[Africa]] where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national [[colony]]. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice. There were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native Africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under European colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as "hell on earth."
[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|left|thumb|European officials staking claims to [[Africa]] in the [[Congress of Berlin]] ]]
At the time of the [[Berlin Conference]], Africa contained one-fifth of the world’s population living in one-quarter of the world’s land area. However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included [[Cape Colony]] (Great Britain), [[Angola]] (Portugal), and [[Algeria]] (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained uncharted, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.

From the 1880s to 1914, the European powers expanded their control across the African continent, competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources. [[Great Britain]] controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The [[France|French]] gained major ground in West Africa, and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] held colonies in southern Africa. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]] established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]] (ruled from 1865 to 1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], which became his personal fiefdom. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. [[Liberia]], which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe, Volume Two: From the French Revolution to the Present'', Third Edition (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;819–859&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meiji Japan ====
{{Main|Meiji period}}
[[File:View of Kobe LACMA M.91.377.8.jpg|left|thumb|Kobe Japan and its harbor, 1865. Hand colored.]] Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[Meiji era]] occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This [[Japanese era name|era name]] means "Enlightened Rule". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Pyle, "Profound Forces in the Making of Modern Japan", ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2006) 32#2 pp. 393–418 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jjs/summary/v032/32.2pyle01.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|hyobusho]] (war office) was replaced with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|War Department]] and a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Naval Department.]] The [[samurai]] class suffered great disappointment the following years.

Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their ''daimyōs'', initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki ("blood tax") literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. Japan's modernized military gave Japan the opportunity to engage in Imperialism with its victory against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan annexed [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and the Chinese province of [[Shandong|Shangdong]].

After the death of the Meiji Emperor, the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] took the throne, the[[Taishō period]] was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all Japanese men. Foreigners would instrumental in aiding in Japan's modernization.  A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] in this period was [[Ernest Mason Satow]].

[[File:Westward the Course of Empire.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way'' (1861).]]
The [[Antebellum Age]] was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and in the western territories of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]] that eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861. The Antebellum Period is often considered to have begun with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} although it may have begun as early as 1812. This period is also significant because it marked the transition of American manufacturing to the industrial revolution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

"[[Manifest destiny]]" was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—"from sea to shining sea"—largely defining the borders of the contiguous United States as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==== Civil War and Reconstruction ====

{{Main|American Civil War|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
The American Civil War began when seven [[Slave state|Southern slave states]] declared their [[secession]] from the U.S. and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], the Confederacy (four more states joinged the Confederacy later). Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], they fought against the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S. federal government (the Union)]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]], which was supported by all the free states and the five [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] in the north.

Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vickysburg]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General [[Robert E. Lee]] proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] in 1864–65. The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77) began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation proclamation]] in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and voting rights for Southern blacks. It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.

==== The Gilded Age and legacy ====
{{Main|Gilded Age}}

[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|1902 New York City in early [[skyscraper]]s]]

During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] created industrial towns and cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial [[working class]] which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialists and financiers called the "robber barons"]]. An example is the company of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, [[Standard Oil]] absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.

The creation of a modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a [[Infrastructure|transportation and communication infrastructure]], the [[corporation]] became the dominant form of business organization and a [[Management|managerial revolution]] transformed [[business]] operations. In 1890, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase "restraint of trade" remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and [[industrial production]] in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form [[labor union]]s despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" [[monopoly]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States'', 221 U.S. 1 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, [[Darwinism]] gained acceptance, promoting the concept of [[adaptation]] in the theory of [[natural selection]].

These ideas were challenged, for example by the [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]], who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of [[human rights]]), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than a secular version of [[theism]]. In his ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.

==== Notable persons ====
[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Albert Einstein in 1921|alt=]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] is renowned for his redefinition of [[sexual desire]] as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]], his [[transference|theory of transference]] in the therapeutic relationship, and the [[Dream interpretation|interpretation of dreams]] as sources of insight into [[unconscious desire]]s.

[[Albert Einstein]] is known for his theories of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. He also made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]], especially his mathematical treatment of [[Brownian motion]], his resolution of the [[Einstein solid|paradox of specific heats]], and his connection of [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|fluctuations and dissipation]]. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, [[quantum field theory]], primarily through his theoretical studies of the [[photon]].

==== Social Darwinism ====
At the end of the 19th century, [[Social Darwinism]] was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a "natural" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the "[[survival of the fittest]]", the term was in fact coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] and referred to in "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" written by [[Andrew Carnegie]].

==== Marxist society ====
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]], produced in the United States|alt=|left]]
[[Karl Marx]] summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848). He wrote:
:''The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of [[class struggle]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;In the 1888 English edition of the ''Communist Manifest'', [[Friedrich Engels]] added a footnote with the commentary: "That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehistory of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, was all but unknown. Since then Haxthausen discovered common ownership of land In Russia, Maurer concluded it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and by and by village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The Inner organization of this primitive Communistic society was laid bare, In its typical form, by Morgan's work on the true nature of the gens and Its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of these primaeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempte to retrace this process of dissolution in "''[[Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats]]''"", from Marx, Karl, Friedrich Engels, Leon Trotsky, and Karl Marx. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEyEzazZKwIC&amp;pg=PA46 The Communist Manifesto and Its Relevance for Today]''. Chippendale, N.S.W.: Resistance Books, 1998. p. 46, see also ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7s0oTEWB_MC&amp;pg=PA204 Cornelius Castoriadis, Political and Social Writings]''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Manifesto'' went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general, [[Marxism]] identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive Communism]]: as seen in cooperative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] Society: which develops when the tribe becomes a city-state. Aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocracy is the ruling class. Merchants develop into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the true working class.
# [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]: workers gain class consciousness, [[Proletarian revolution|overthrow]] the capitalists and take control over the [[Socialist state|state]].
# [[Communism]]: a [[classless society|classless]] and [[stateless society]].

[[File:Australia 1900.jpg|thumb|Though still tied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] [[Australia]] achieved peaceful independence in 1901.|alt=]]
Major political developments saw the former [[British Empire]] lose most of its remaining political power over [[British Commonwealth|commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably by dividing the British crown into several sovereignties by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[patriation]] of constitutions by the [[Canada Act 1982]] and the [[Australia Act 1986]], and by the independence of countries such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], two world wars, and the [[Cold War]].

==== Australian Constitution ====
In 1901, the [[Federation of Australia]] was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, the colonies collectively became [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].

==== Revolution and Warlords in China ====
[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Xinhai Revolution]] in [[Shanghai]]; [[Chen Qimei]] organized Shanghainese civilians to start the uprising and was successful. The picture above is [[Nanjing Road]] after the uprising, hung with the [[Five Races Under One Union]] Flags then used by the revolutionaries.|alt=|left]]
The last days of the [[Qing dynasty]] were marked with civil unrest, [[Hundred Days' Reform|failed reforms]] and foreign invasions such as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer rebellion]]. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution.

The assertions of Chinese philosophy&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Enlightenment. By Vera Schwarcz. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century

In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in [[Nanjing]] as the first [[President of the Republic of China|Provisional President]]. But power in [[Beijing]] already had passed to [[Yuan Shikai]], who had effective control of the [[Beiyang Army]], the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent [[civil war]] and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

After the early 20th century revolutions, shifting alliances of [[Warlord era (China)|China's regional warlords]] waged war for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the [[Beiyang government]]. The warlord era ended around 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, W.A. (2010). ''Politics in China: An introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Start of the 20th century =====
[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|center|thumb|700x700px|The World in 1898 color coded for major empires.

[[File:Battle of Yalu River 1904.jpg|thumb|The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was the first time a European Country was defeated by an Asian Country in modern times. The Japanese Victory shocked the world.|alt=]]
In 1900 the World's Population had approached approximately 1.6 billion.
Four years into the 20th century saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] establishing the [[Empire of Japan]] as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a [[warm water port]] on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the [[Russian Empire]] was fought against the Japanese over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]]. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Mukden]], and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.

The [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected.  It included [[terrorism]], worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Constitution of 1906]]&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]], and the [[multi-party system]].

In China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The Xinhai Revolution began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of [[Emperor Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the [[Tongmenghui|Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui).

===== Edwardian Britain =====
[[File:Steamship Titanic.jpg|thumb|The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was the largest ship constructed in its time. Deemed invincible, it was sunk by [[iceberg]]s off the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada.]] |alt=|left]]
The [[Edwardian era]] in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. In the early years of the period, the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]] the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the [[House of Lords]], which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the [[People's Budget]] led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910. The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January that year]] returned a [[hung parliament]] with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Irish Nationalist]] members.

===== World War I =====
{{Main|World War I}}

The [[causes of World War I]] included many factors, including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war. The [[Triple Entente]] was the name given to the loose alignment between the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907.  The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the United States, and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], constituted a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of Austria.

However, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the [[Baghdad Railway]] which was planned to connect the [[Ottoman Empire]] cities of [[Konya]] and [[Baghdad]] with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;([[Morris Jastrow, Jr.|Jastrow]] 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The [[Balkan Wars]] were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the [[Balkan League]] (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] in 1918. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], led by the [[Britain in World War I|British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], Russia until March 1918, Japan and the United States after 1917, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the [[Triple Entente]], and the Central Powers are referred to as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].

[[File:Chemical Warfare in the Twentieth Century Q54781.jpg|left|thumb|[[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] was used for the first time in WWI. Soldiers used [[Gas mask|gas-masks]] to protect themselves]]Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a "[[No man's land]]") running from the [[North Sea]] to the border of Switzerland. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large.  Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide [[Spanish flu|influenza outbreak]] at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=John M.|authorlink=John M. Barry|title=The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Greatest Plague in History|publisher=Viking Penguin|year=2004|isbn=978-0670894734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations.&lt;ref&gt;Roderic H. Davison; Review "From Paris to Sèvres: The Partition of the Ottoman Empire at the Peace Conference of 1919–1920. by Paul C. Helmreich" in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 34, No. 1 (March, 1975), pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; The partitioning brought the creation of the modern [[Arab world]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The [[League of Nations]] granted France mandates over [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and granted the United Kingdom mandates over [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] (which was later divided into two regions: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became parts of what are today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]].

===== Revolutions and war in Eurasia =====

{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Lenin.gif|thumb|Lenin]]

The Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established. In October 1917, a [[October Revolution|''red'' faction revolution]] occurred in which the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of [[Saint Petersburg]] (then known as [[Petrograd]]) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former [[Russian Empire]].

Another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between Russia and the Central Powers at [[Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Mawdsley (2008) ''The Russian Civil War'': 42&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition for peace, the treaty by the [[Central Powers]] conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [[nationalist]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. The Bolsheviks made peace with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]], as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].  The [[Triple Entente|Western Allies]] expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:
# the withdrawal of Russia from the war effort,
# worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, and
# galvanized by the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good their threats to assume no responsibility for, and so default on, Imperial Russia's massive [[External debt|foreign loans]].&lt;ref&gt;the legal notion of [[Odious debt]] had not yet been formulated&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Russian civil war posters.png|left|thumb|Two contrasting visions of the [[Russian Civil War]]. To the left is propaganda from the [[White Army]], to the right is propaganda from the [[Bolsheviks]]. ]]
In addition, there was a concern, shared by many [[Central Powers]] as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004110408/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 |date=2006-10-04 }} Interview with Jeffrey Wallin. (The Churchill Centre)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian provisional government]] collapsed and the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviets]] under the domination of the [[Bolshevik]] party assumed power, first in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd (St. Petersburg)]] and then in other places. In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Christopher, ''From Tsar to Soviets'', Oxford University Press (1996), p. 237: By 1920, 77% of the Red Army's enlisted ranks were composed of peasant conscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Beryl, ''The Russian Revolution 1917–1921'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

[[File:Vladivostok intervention.jpg|thumb|In the Russian Civil War, over eleven nations intervened in favor of the [[White Movement]]. Here Japanese occupy [[Vladivostok]].]]
The principal fighting occurred between the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the forces of the [[White Movement|White Army]]. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Forces]], yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist [[Green armies|Green Army]], the Ukrainian anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and [[Black Guards]], and warlords such as [[Ungern von Sternberg]]. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied [[Vladivostok]], previously held by the [[Provisional Priamur Government]]. The last enclave of the White Forces was the [[Ayano-Maysky District]] on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in the [[Crimea]], but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., [[Kronstadt Uprising]], [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Basmachi Revolt]], and the final resistance of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]).

While the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary Russia and Central Asia, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen [[Russian Empire]]. Revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] died of natural causes and was succeeded by [[Joseph Stalin]].

==== The Early Republic of China ====

In 1917, China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. The [[New Culture Movement]] occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike.
[[File:Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2.jpg|left|thumb|Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2]]

The [[May Fourth Movement]] helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 [[Sun Yat-sen]] had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in [[Guangzhou]] in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).[[File:Sino-german cooperation.png|thumb|With [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941]], Chinese industry and military was improved just prior to the war against Japan.|alt=|150x150px]]

In early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to [[Wuhan]]. But [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Northern Expedition]] was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in [[April 12 Incident|April 1927]].

The interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the Second World War. This period was marked by turmoil in much of the world, as Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War.[[File:A flapper girl LCCN2012645724.tif|thumb|227x227px|American, Flapper Girl.

"[[Normalcy]]" returned to politics, [[jazz music]] blossomed, the [[flapper]] redefined modern womanhood, [[Art Deco]] peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].[[File:I Got The Ritz From The One I Love.ogg|left|thumb|''I got the Ritz from the one I love,'' Jazz music radio broadcast 1932]]
Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation]] of 1923 and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, [[economic development]] soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the "[[Golden Twenties]]".

The ''Great Depression'' was a worldwide economic [[Recession|downturn]] starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries.&lt;ref name="CRomer1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression "Great Depression"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and most important [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''New York Times'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. [[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title=Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cochrane, Willard W.|title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of economic activity|primary sector industries]] suffered the most.

Parket Willis Lecture in Economic Policy", March 2, 2004, FDR Library Web Site.''&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist [[Demagogy|demagogues]]—the most infamous being [[Adolf Hitler]]—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of [[Nazism]]. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.

===== The League and crises =====
[[File:Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg|thumb|U.K Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] attempted to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]] as Nazi Germany practiced an expansionist policy .|alt=|left]]
The interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.[[File:Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, Hebei, autumn 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] soldiers defending at the Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, [[Hebei]], [[China]] autumn 1937. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] cost at least twenty millions lives. ]]A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan and the [[Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], one of the only free African nations at that time.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, Münchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|left|thumb|The signatories [[Munich Agreement]] where British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] [[Appeasement|appeased]] to the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] regarding territorial claims in [[Sudetenland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid conflict.]]
The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.

===== Tripartite Pact =====
[[File:Shashin Shuho No 151.jpg|left|thumb|141x141px|Japanese poster advocating for Tripartite Pact, 1941.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940–41, and with the continuing war in China, the United States placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[South East Asia]]—specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

=====World War II=====

{{Main|World War II}}
[[File:Ww2 allied axis 1942 jun.png|center|thumb|700x700px|World War II at the height of Axis expansion (black) fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (blue) and [[Communist International|Comintern]] (red). It is important to note that the [[Empire of Japan]] was not at war with the [[Soviet Union]] despite being part of the [[Tripartite Pact]].]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-012-0037-23A, Polen, Straßenkampf, Infanterie.jpg|left|thumb|The German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 is the official start of [[World War II|WWII]]]]

The Second World War was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in [[the Holocaust]] and ending with the dropping of the [[atom bomb]].

Even though Japan had been invading in China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1, 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland, the [[Drang nach Osten]]. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.
The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.
[[File:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red Army.jpg|alt=Holocaust Survivors, January 1945|thumb|Survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] at the infamous German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] located in Occupied Poland. ]]
Following the lull in fighting, known as the "[[Phoney War]]", Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the [[Tripartite Pact]], and were known as the [[Axis Powers]].Nine months later, on June 22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany – Germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against the Axis.

On December 7, 1941, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor]], bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful" during the [[World War II]]&lt;ref name = Justus&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Stoler |first2=Mark A. |title=Debating Franklin D.

''FDR and the Creation of the U.N.'' (Yale University Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; These four countries were considered as the "[[Four Policemen]]" or "Four Sheriffs" of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies power]] and primary victors of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Lewis|last=Gaddis|title=The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941–1947|year=1972|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231122399|pages=24–25|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then through August 1945, battles raged across all of Europe, in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], across North Africa, throughout [[Southeast Asia]], throughout China, across the Pacific Ocean and in the air over Japan.
Italy surrendered in September 1943 and was split into a northern Germany-occupied [[puppet state]] and an Allies-friendly state in the South; Germany surrendered in May 1945. Following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], [[surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], marking the end of the war on September 2, 1945.

It is possible that around 62 million people [[World War II casualties|died in the war]]; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, [[genocide]] (in particular, the [[Holocaust]]), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.
The Holocaust (which roughly means "burnt whole") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other "unwanted" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.

After World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Western Europe]] later aligned as the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and [[Eastern Europe]] as the [[Warsaw Pact]]. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the [[British Empire]] to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the [[Cold War]]. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its [[democratization]]. [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.

== End of the Period – Postwar World ==
{{Main|Contemporary history}}
[[File:The Beatles i Hötorgscity 1963.jpg|thumb|During [[Pax Americana]], the [[Popular music|popular music industry]] flourished.Pictured here is the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] Group. |alt=|200x200px]]

The mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history.

Over the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita [[gross domestic product]] grew by a factor of five,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bradford DeLong, [http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html ''Cornucopia: Increasing Wealth in the Twentieth Century''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230090216/http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html |date=2005-12-30 }}. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning.  However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider,&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Wayne. ''Theoretical criminology: from modernity to post-modernism''. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Program). ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being''. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2005. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the [[Global South]]. Large-scale industry and more centralized [[Mass media|media]] made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented. However, the increased communications contributed to [[democratization]]. Technological developments included the development of airplanes and [[space exploration]], [[nuclear technology]], advancement in [[genetics]], and the dawning of the [[Information Age]].

=== American Peace ===

{{Main|Pax Americana}}
Pax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.
{{details|American Century}}

=== Cold War era ===
{{Main|Cold War}}
The Cold War began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict included costly defense spending, a massive [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and numerous [[proxy war]]s; the two [[superpower]]s never fought one another directly.

[[File:NATO vs. Warsaw (1949-1990).svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|{{center|Borders of [[NATO]] (blue) and [[Warsaw Pact]] (red) states during the Cold war era.}}]]
The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a policy of "[[containment]]" of [[communism]] and forged myriad alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe, including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the world, such as Latin America and [[Southeast Asia]], the Soviet Union fostered [[communist revolution]]ary movements, which the United States and many of its allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to "[[rollback|roll back]]". Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge.
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|left|thumb|US and USSR nuclear stockpiles]]
In China [[Mao Zedong]] (''Máo zé dōng'') utilized [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought. When the [[Communist Party of China]] assumed power in 1959, previous schools of Chinese thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward. Many parts of China's past were even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though initially friendly with the [[Soviet Union]] the Chinese and Soviet communists diverged in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1960. Through the end of the Cold-War, China would continue on its own path from other communist countries, building better relations with the United States after 1972. China's economy would recover from the Cultural Revolution due to [[Chinese economic reform|market-oriented reforms]] led by [[Deng Xiaoping]].

The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) and [[Able Archer 83|NATO exercises in November 1983]]. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought [[détente]]. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for [[mutual assured destruction]] using deliverable [[nuclear weapon]]s.

|}

The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' reforms. [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|The Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power, though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet nuclear arsenal.

=== Latin America polarization ===

In Latin America in the 1970s, leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America. In the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |author=Victor Flores Olea |title=Editoriales – El Universal – 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor |work=[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico |accessdate=2009-03-24 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021303/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies.

=== Space Age ===

[[File:Neil Armstrong small step.wav|left|thumb|Neil Armstrong small step]]
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of Earth as seen from Apollo 17. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase of interest in both [[space exploration]] and the [[environmental movement]].]]
The [[Space Age]] is a period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83&amp;nbsp;kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the [[Vostok programme]] and reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]] which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11]] was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], public attention has largely moved to other areas.

== Education and schools ==
The [[humanities]] are academic disciplines which study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic induction|analytic]], critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. Although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world.

=== British education ===
Students can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history; very few teach the subject exclusively.

=== Universities ===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[List of alumni of Jesus College, Oxford]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Oxford]] 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period that can be studied in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History begins in 285.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

{{History of Greece}}

'''Mycenaean Greece''' (or the '''Mycenaean civilization''') was the last phase of the [[Bronze Age]] in [[Ancient Greece]], spanning the period from approximately 1600–1100 BCE. It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland [[Greece]], with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|pp=10–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the centers of power that emerged, the most notable were those of [[Pylos]], [[Tiryns]], [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]] in the [[Peloponnese]], [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Athens]] in [[Central Greece]] and [[Iolcos]] in [[Thessaly]]. The most prominent site was [[Mycenae]], in [[Regions of ancient Greece#Argolis|the Argolid]], after which the culture of this era is named. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in [[Epirus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1976|loc=p. 139: "Moreover, in this area a small tholos-tomb with Mycenaean pottery of III B style and a Mycenaean acropolis have been reported at Kiperi near Parga, and another Mycenaean acropolis lay above the Oracle of the Dead on the hill called Xylokastro."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tandy|2001|loc=p. xii (Fig. 1); p. 2: "The strongest evidence for Mycenaean presence in Epirus is found in the coastal zone of the lower Acheron River, which in antiquity emptied into a bay on the Ionian coast known from ancient sources as ''Glykys Limin'' (Figure 2-A)."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borza|1992|loc=p. 64: "The existence of a Late Bronze Age Mycenaean settlement in the Petra not only confirms its importance as a route from an early period, but also extends the limits of Mycenaean settlement to the Macedonian frontier."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aegeobalkanprehistory.net/img_articles/thumbs/tmb_75.jpg Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory – Mycenaean Sites]&lt;/ref&gt; on islands in the [[Aegean Sea]], on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part II: The Levant, pp. 31–124}}; {{harvnb|Bietak|Czerny|2007|loc=Sigrid Deger-Jalkotzy, "Mycenaeans and Philistines in the Levant", pp. 501–629}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part III: Cyprus, pp. 125–202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peruzzi|1980}}; {{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part IV: The Central Mediterranean, pp. 203–260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the [[Mediterranean]] was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their [[syllabic script]], the [[Linear B]], offers the first written records of the [[Greek language]] and [[Mycenaean religion|their religion]] already included several deities that can also be found in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic Pantheon]]. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as [[wanax]].

Mycenaean Greece perished with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze Age culture]] in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]], a recordless transitional period leading to [[Archaic Greece]] where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the [[Iron Age|extensive use of iron]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1996|loc="Greece: Dark Age Greece", pp. 253–256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the [[Dorian invasion]] or activities connected to the "[[Sea Peoples]]". Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], including the [[Epic cycle|Trojan Epic Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Homer attempted to or succeeded in recreating a "Mycenaean" setting is examined in [[Moses I. Finley]] ''The World of Odysseus'', 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
[[File:Lions-Gate-Mycenae.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]], the main entrance of the citadel of Mycenae, 13th century BC]]
{{Main|Helladic period}}

The Bronze Age in mainland Greece is generally termed as the "Helladic period" by modern archaeologists, after ''Hellas'', the Greek name for [[Greece]]. This period is divided into three subperiods: The Early Helladic (EH) period (c. 2900–2000 BC) was a time of prosperity with the use of metals and a growth in technology, economy and social organization. The Middle Helladic (MH) period (ca. 2000–1650 BC) faced a slower pace of development, as well as the evolution of [[megaron]]-type dwellings and [[cist]] grave burials.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; Finally, the Late Helladic (LH) period (c. 1650–1050 BC) roughly coincides with Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;

The Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI and LHII, both of which coincide with the early period of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1650–1425 BC), and LHIII (c. 1425–1050 BC), the period of expansion, decline and collapse of the Mycenaean civilization.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (c. 1050–1000 BC).&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;

{{See also|Names of the Greeks|Achaeans (Homer)}}

The [[decipherment]] of the Mycenaean [[Linear B]] script, a writing system adapted for the use of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|pp=159, 165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the ''[[Iliad]]'', in reference to the [[Trojan War]]. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13th{{snd}}early 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of [[Troy]]. Homer used the [[ethnonym]]s Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an isolated reference to ''a-ka-wi-ja-de'' in the Linear B records in [[Knossos]], Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hajnal|Posch|2009|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian records mention a ''T(D)-n-j'' or ''Danaya'' (''Tanaju'') land for the first time in circa 1437 BC, during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmoses III]] (r. 1479–1425 BC). This land is geographically defined in an inscription from the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] (r. circa 1390–1352 BC), where a number of Danaya cities are mentioned, which cover the largest part of southern mainland Greece.&lt;ref name=Kelder4647&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, cities such as Mycenae, Nauplion and Thebes have been identified with certainty. Danaya has been equated with the ethnonym ''Danaoi'' ({{lang-el|Δαναοί}}), the name of the mythical dynasty that ruled in the region of Argos, also used as an ethnonym for the Greek people by Homer.&lt;ref name=Kelder4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=37–38}}; {{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the official records of another Bronze Age empire, that of the [[Hittites]] in [[Anatolia]], various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named ''Ahhiyawa''.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, as well as on recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term ''Ahhiyawa'' must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it.&lt;ref name=Bryce58&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline4&gt;{{harvnb|Beckman|Bryce|Cline|2012|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar ethnonym ''Ekwesh'' in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the [[Sea People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=357}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Shaft grave era (c. 1600–1450 BC)===
[[File:MaskOfAgamemnon.jpg|thumb|Death mask, known as the [[Mask of Agamemnon]], Grave Circle A, Mycenae, 16th century BC, probably the most famous artifact of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2010|p=92: "The most famous object from Shaft Grave V, if not all of Mycenaean Greece, is the gold mask popularly known as the "mask of Agamemnon"."}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mycenaean civilization originated and evolved from the society and culture of the Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]].&lt;ref name=Dickinson&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=32, 53, 107–108}}; {{harvnb|Dickinson|1999|pp=97–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) a significant increase in the population and the number of settlements occurred.&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt; A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society,&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickinson/&gt; while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of [[megaron]] buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, new types of burials and more imposing ones have been unearthed, which display a great variety of luxurious objects.&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various burial types, the [[shaft grave]] became the most common form of elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Schofield31&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles [[Grave Circle A|A]] and [[Grave Circle B|B]] signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=53, 107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the Mycenaean centers witnessed increased contacts with the outside world and especially with the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] centers in the island of [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt; Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]], on [[Thera]] island, which possibly displays many warriors in [[Boar's tusk helmet]]s, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], including [[Miletus]] and [[Troy]], [[Cyprus]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=64–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Shaft Grave era, a new and more imposing type of elite burial emerged, the [[Beehive tomb#Greece|Tholos]]: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koine era (c. 1450 BC–1250 BC)===
[[File:La Dame de Mycènes, fresco.jpg|thumb|Fresco depicting a female figure in the acropolis of Mycenae, 13th century BC]]
The [[Minoan eruption|eruption of Thera]], which according to archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in the decline of the Minoan civilization of Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including [[Knossos]], and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield7172/&gt; Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from {{lang-el|Κοινή}}, common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade began to take advantage of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse.&lt;ref name=Schofield7172&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade routes were expanded further, reaching [[Cyprus]], [[Amman]] in the Near East, [[Apulia]] in Italy and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=Schofield7172/&gt; From that time period (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos has yielded the earliest records of the Greek [[Linear B]] script, based on the previous [[Linear A]] of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight into the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.&lt;ref name="Kelder8"/&gt;

[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|left|Mycenaean [[Dendra panoply|panoply]], found in Dendra, Argolid, {{circa}} 1400 BC]]

Excavations at Miletus, southwest [[Asia Minor]], indicate the existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from c. 1450 BC, replacing the previous Minoan installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This site became a sizable and prosperous Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=50, 52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Bryce 2005 361"&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of [[Iasos|Iasus]] and [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|loc=p. 194: "The Mycenaean colonies in Anatolia were emphatically confined to a narrow coastal strip in the west. There were community-colonies at Ephesus, Iasos and Miletus, but they had little effect on the interior..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, imposing palaces were built in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in [[Sparta]], [[Lakonia]].&lt;ref name="Kelder107"/&gt; Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean fortifications]] were erected at Mycenae and nearby [[Tiryns]].&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; Additional palaces were built in [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]] and [[Pylos]] in [[Peloponnese]], [[Athens]], [[Eleusis]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]] in [[Central Greece]] and [[Iolcos]], in [[Thessaly]], the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete also became a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a [[Throne Room, Knossos|throne room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=108–109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as [[anax|wanax]] (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Involvement in Asia Minor====
The presence of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC.&lt;ref name="Bryce 2005 361"/&gt; Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical definition of the term cannot be drawn from the texts.&lt;ref name="BeckmanBryceCline6"/&gt; During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=119–120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=59}}; {{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC; Mycenaean Greece in purple]]

In c. 1400 BC, Hittite records mention the military activities of an Ahhiyawan warlord, [[Attarsiya]], a possible Hittite way of writing the Greek name [[Atreus]], who attacked Hittite vassals in western Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|pp=129, 368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in c. 1315 BC, an anti-Hittite rebellion headed by [[Arzawa]], a Hittite vassal state, received support from Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ahhiyawa appears to be in control of a number of islands in the Aegean, an impression also supported by archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Hittite king [[Hattusili III]] (c. 1267–1237 BC), the king of Ahhiyawa is recognized as a "Great King" and of equal status with the other contemporary great Bronze Age rulers: the kings of [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Kassites|Babylonia]] and [[Middle Assyrian period#Middle Assyrian Empire 1392-1056 BC|Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=58}}; {{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=119–120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, another anti-Hittite movement, led by [[Piyama-Radu]], broke out and was supported by the king of Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Piyama-Radu caused major unrest in the region of [[Wilusa]] and later invaded the island of [[Lesbos]], which then passed into Ahhiyawan control.&lt;ref name=Kelder27&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hittite-Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa, the Hittite name for [[Troy]], may provide the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historical foundation]] for the [[Trojan War]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|pp=361, 364}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this instability, the Hittite king initiated [[Tawagalawa letter|correspondence]] in order to convince his Ahhiyawan counterpart to restore peace in the region. The Hittite record mentions a certain Tawagalawa, a possible Hittite translation for Greek Eteocles, as brother of the king of Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref name=Kelder27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse (c. 1250–1100 BC)===

====Initial decline and revival====
[[File:Marching soldiers observed by a female figure, in a krater of c. 1200 BC in Mycenae.jpg|thumb|left|Marching soldiers observed by a female figure, in a [[Warrior Vase|krater]] of c. 1200 BC in Mycenae]]
In {{circa}} 1250 BC, the first wave of destruction apparently occurred in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. In [[Boeotia]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] was burned to the ground, around that year or slightly later. Nearby [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]] shared the same fate, while the Boeotian fortifications of [[Gla]] were deserted.&lt;ref name="Kelder 2010 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Peloponnese, a number of buildings surrounding the citadel of Mycenae were attacked and burned.&lt;ref name="Cline 2014 130"&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2014|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents appear to have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls.&lt;ref name=Castleden219&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extension program in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive [[Lion Gate]], the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.&lt;ref name=Castleden219/&gt;

It appears that after this first wave of destruction a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to have been involved in an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia.&lt;ref name=Kelder33&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]]-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, in the second half of 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final collapse====
None of the defence measures appear to have prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event marked the end of Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="Cline 2014 130"/&gt; The palace of [[Pylos]], in the southwestern Peloponnese, was destroyed in c. 1180 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2014|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tartaron18&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.&lt;ref name=Freeman126&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2014|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this turmoil, specific regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and [[Messenia]].&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Mycenaean refugees migrated to [[Cyprus]] and the [[Levant]]ine coast.&lt;ref name=Tartaron18/&gt; Nevertheless, other regions on the edge of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the [[Ionian islands]], the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of [[Attica]] and a number of Aegean islands.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; The [[acropolis of Athens]], oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt;

====Hypotheses for the collapse====
{{See also|Bronze Age collapse|Dorian Invasion}}
[[File:Invasions, destructions and possible population movements during the Bronze Age Collapse, ca. 1200 BC.png|thumb|Invasions, destructions and possible population movements during the collapse of the Bronze Age, ca. 1200 BC]]

The reasons for the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|pp=227–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of a [[Dorian invasion]], known as such in [[Ancient Greek Mythology|Ancient Greek tradition]], that led to the end of Mycenaean Greece, is supported by sporadic archaeological evidence such as new types of burials, in particular cist graves, and the use of a new dialect of Greek, the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] one. It appears that the Dorians moved southward gradually over a number of years and devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|pp=231–232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A new type of ceramic also appeared, called "Barbarian Ware" because it was attributed to invaders from the north.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; On the other hand, the collapse of Mycenaean Greece coincides with the activity of the [[Sea Peoples]] in the Eastern Mediterranean. They caused widespread destruction in Anatolia and the Levant and were finally [[Battle of the Delta|defeated]] by Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] in c. 1175 BC. One of the ethnic groups that comprised these people were the ''Eqwesh'', a name that appears to be linked with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1993|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative scenarios propose that the fall of Mycenaean Greece was a result of internal disturbances which led to internecine warfare among the Mycenaean states or civil unrest in a number of states, as a result of the strict hierarchical social system and the ideology of the wanax.&lt;ref name=Tartaron19/&gt; In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th-11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Additional theories, concerning [[Bronze Age collapse#Nature and causes of destruction|natural factors]], such as climate change, droughts or earthquakes have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Tartaron19&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory considers the decline of the Mycenaean civilization as a manifestation of a common pattern for the decline of many ancient civilizations: the Minoan, the Harrapan and the Western Roman Empire. The reason for the decline is migration due to overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Alexakha A model of social progress. The journal of European economic history. (3) pp. 164-169.  http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2016;3.137&amp;ev=1&lt;/ref&gt; The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100-800 BC, is generally termed the "[[Greek Dark Ages]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2014|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
[[File:Mycenaean Palace States.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Reconstruction of the political landscape in c. 1400-1250 BC mainland southern Greece]]

===Palatial states===
Mycenaean palatial states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, are recorded in ancient [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]] (e.g., ''Iliad'', [[Catalogue of Ships]]) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over most, if not all, industries within its realm. The palatial territory was divided into several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center.&lt;ref name=Kelder9/&gt; Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the ''da-mo''.&lt;ref name=Kelder9/&gt; A number of palaces and fortifications appear to be part of a wider kingdom. For instance, [[Gla]], located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos.&lt;ref name="Kelder 2010 34"/&gt; Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to three times the size of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including [[Tiryns]] and [[Nafplio|Nauplion]], which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae's ruling dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape in Mycenaean Greece and they do not support the existence of a larger Mycenaean state.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline6&gt;{{harvnb|Beckman|Bryce|Cline|2012|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a "Great King".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=45, 86, 107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, based on archaeological data, some sort of confederation among a number of palatial states appears to be possible.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline6/&gt; If some kind of united political entity existed, the dominant center was probably located in Thebes or in Mycenae, with the latter state being the most probable center of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and administration===

The Neolithic agrarian village (6000 BC) constituted the foundation of Bronze Age political culture in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast majority of the preserved Linear B records deal with administrative issues and give the impression that Mycenaean palatial administration was highly uniform with the use of the same language, terminology, system of taxation and distribution.&lt;ref name=Kelder8&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelder9&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this sense of uniformity, the [[Pylos]] archive, which is the best preserved one in the Mycenaean world, is generally taken as a representative one.&lt;ref name=Kelder8/&gt;

The state was ruled by a king, the ''[[anax|wanax]]'' (ϝάναξ), whose role was religious and perhaps also military and judicial.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|loc=Chapter 5: Social Structure and Administrative System, pp. 69–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The wanax oversaw virtually all aspects of palatial life, from religious feasting and offerings to the distribution of goods, craftsmen and troops.&lt;ref name=Kelder11&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under him was the ''lāwāgetas'' ("the leader of the people"), whose role appears mainly religious. His activities possibly overlap with the wanax and is usually seen as the second-in-command.&lt;ref name=Kelder11/&gt; Both wanax and lāwāgetas were at the head of a military aristocracy known as the ''eqeta'' ("companions" or "followers").&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land possessed by the wanax is usually the ''témenos'' (te-me-no). There is also at least one instance of a person, [[Enkhelyawon]], at Pylos, who appears titleless in the written record but whom modern scholars regard as probably a king.&lt;ref name=Chadwick71-72&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 71–72].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of local officials positioned by the wanax appear to be in charge of the districts, such as ''ko-re-te'' (''koreter'', '"governor"), ''po-ro-ko-re-te'' (''prokoreter'', "deputy") and the ''da-mo-ko-ro'' (''damokoros'', "one who takes care of a damos"), the latter probably being appointed to take charge of the commune. A council of elders was chaired, the ''ke-ro-si-ja'' (cf. γερουσία, ''gerousía''). The ''basileus'', who in latter Greek society was the name of the king, refers to communal officials.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;

In general, Mycenaean society appears to have been divided into two groups of free men: the king's entourage, who conducted administrative duties at the palace, and the people, ''[[wikt:δῆμος|da-mo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dh{{=}}mos|δῆμος|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These last were watched over by royal agents and were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt; Among those who could be found in the palace were well-to-do high officials, who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the ''da-mo'', such as craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants. Occupying a lower rung of the social ladder were the slaves, ''do-e-ro'', ([[cf.]] {{lang|grc|δοῦλος}}, ''doúlos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dou{{=}}los1|δοῦλος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;

==Economy==

===Organization===
The Mycenaean economy, given its pre-monetary nature, was focused on the redistribution of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel.&lt;ref name=Olsen7&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2014|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods.&lt;ref name=Cline242&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Budin94&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central [[Crete]], and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated.&lt;ref name=Budin94/&gt; The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, palatial control over resources appears to have been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2014|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale infrastructure===
The palatial centers organized their workforce and resources for the construction of large scale projects in the fields of agriculture and industry.&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The magnitude of some projects indicates that this was the result of combined efforts from multiple palatial centers.  Most notable of them are the drainage system of the [[Lake Copais|Kopais]] basin in Boeotia, the building of a large dam outside Tiryns, and the drainage of the swamp in the [[Nemea]] valley.&lt;ref name="Kelder116"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also noticeable is the construction of harbors, such as the harbor of Pylos, that were capable of accommodating large Bronze Age era vessels like the one found at [[Uluburun shipwreck|Uluburun]].&lt;ref name="Kelder116"/&gt; The Mycenaean economy also featured large-scale manufacturing as testified by the extent of workshop complexes that have been discovered, the largest known to date being the recent ceramic and hydraulic installations found in [[Euonymeia]], next to Athens, that produced tableware, textiles, sails, and ropes for [[export]] and [[shipbuilding]].&lt;ref name="Gilstrap"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gilstrap|first=William|last2=Day|first2=Peter|last3=Kaza|first3=Konstantina|last4=Kardamaki|first4=Elina|title=Pottery Production at the Late Mycenaean site of Alimos, Attica|conference=Materials and Industries in the Mycenaean World: Current Approaches to the Study of Materials and Industries in Prehistoric Greece, University of Nottingham, 9–10 May 2013|conferenceurl=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/archaeology/documents/conferences/ahrc-conference-abstracts.pdf|place=Nottingham, UK|date=9 May 2013|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous project of the Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref name="Kelder116"/&gt; This appears to have facilitated the speedy deployment of troops—for example, the remnants of a Mycenaean road, along with what appears to have been a Mycenaean defensive wall on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
[[File:Earring Mycenae Louvre Bj135.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Gold earring, ca. 1600 BC, Louvre Museum]]
[[File:Megiste-Bronze Reconstruction of a Mycenaean ship.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a Mycenaean ship]]
Trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the economy of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from these materials, in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, wool and pottery.&lt;ref name=Cline145&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; International trade of that time was not only conducted by palatial emissaries but also by independent merchants.&lt;ref name="Cline200"/&gt;

Based on archaeological findings in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction with most of the Bronze Age people living in this region: [[Canaan]]ites, [[Kassites]], [[Mitanni]], [[History of the Assyrian people#Ancient Assyria|Assyrians]], and [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]].&lt;ref name=Cline200&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stubbings|1951|loc=IV: Mycenaean II Pottery in Syria and Palestine; V: Mycenaean III Pottery in Syria and Palestine}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petrie|1894}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[Uluburun shipwreck]], off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials and items that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|pp=300, 387, 787}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A chief export of the Mycenaeans was [[olive oil]], which was a multi-purpose product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=107: "Huge quantities of olive oil were produced and it must have been a major source of wealth. The simple fact that southern Greece is far more suitable climatically for olive production may explain why the Mycenaean civilization made far greater advances in the south than in the north. The oil had a variety of uses, in cooking, as a dressing, as soap, as lamp oil, and as a base for manufacturing unguents."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus appears to be the principal intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Kling|1989}}; {{harvnb|Nikolaou|1973}}; {{harvnb|International Archaeological Symposium|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, trade with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited.&lt;ref name=Cline200/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with [[Troy]] is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the [[Bosphorus]] and the shores of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the eastern Black Sea coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/historic/hs/september02.html Boston University – The Historical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial interaction was also intense with the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to [[Magna Grecia|southern Italy]], [[Sicily]] and the [[Aeolian islands]]. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into [[Sardinia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Feuer|2004|pp=155–157}}; {{harvnb|Balmuth|Tykot|1998|loc="The Mycenaeans in Sardinia", p. 400}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgway|1992|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Taylour|1958}}; {{harvnb|Fisher|1998}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Vianello|2005|loc="Eastern Sicily and the Aeolian Islands", p. 51}}; {{harvnb|Feuer|2004|pp=155–157}}; {{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part IV: The Central Mediterranean, pp. 203-260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as southern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de la Cruz|1988|pp=77–92}}; {{harvnb|Ridgway|1992|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporadic objects of Mycenaean manufacture were found in various distant locations, like in Central Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], where an amber object inscribed with Linear B symbols has been unearthed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kranznet.indi.de/brzeit/goldfund/bernstei.htm |title=Amber object bearing Linear B symbols |access-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830122309/http://www.kranznet.indi.de/brzeit/goldfund/bernstei.htm |archive-date=August 30, 2016 |location=Freising |year=1999 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects dating from the 13th century BC have been found in [[Ireland]] and in [[Wessex]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|loc=p. 53: "One of the most extraordinary examples of the extent of Mycenaean influence was the Pelynt Dagger, a fragment of a Late Helladic III sword, which has come to light in the tomb of a Wessex chieftain in southern England!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feuer|2004|p=259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temples and shrines are strangely rare in the Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic structures are absent at all the palatial centers, with the exception of Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae seems to have been a later (13th century BC) development.&lt;ref name=Kelder115/&gt; Small shrines have been identified in [[Asine]], Berbati, Malthi and Pylos,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, [[Delphi]] and [[Amyclae|Amyklae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Linear B records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Adams John|title=Mycenaean Divinities|location=Northridge, CA|publisher=California State University|date=10 January 2010|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/mycen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods.&lt;ref name=Castleden143&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.&lt;ref name=Kelder115&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poseidon]] (Linear B: ''Po-se-da-o'') seems to have occupied a place of privilege. He was a [[chthonic]] deity, connected with earthquakes (''E-ne-si-da-o-ne'': Earth-shaker), but it seems that he also represented the river spirit of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paean (god)|Paean]] (''Pa-ja-wo'') is probably the precursor of the Greek physician of the gods in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the personification of the magic-song which was supposed to "heal" the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1967|loc=Volume I, pp. 500–504}}; {{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|loc=p. 88: "''Pa-ja-wo'' suggested Homeric Paieon, which earlier would have been ''Paiawon'', later ''Paidn'', an alternative name of Apollo, if not again a separate god."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of divinities have been identified in the Mycenaean scripts only by their [[epithet]]s used during later antiquity. For example, ''Qo-wi-ja'' ("cow-eyed") is a standard Homeric ephithet of Hera.&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"/&gt; Ares appeared under the name ''Enyalios'' (assuming that ''Enyalios'' is not a separate god).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=95, 99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional divinities that can be also found in later periods include [[Hephaestus]], [[Erinyes|Erinya]], [[Artemis]] (''a-te-mi-to'' and ''a-ti-mi-te'') and [[Dionysos]] (''Di-wo-nu-so'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1967|loc=Volume I, pp. 565–568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|Baumbach|1963|p=176f}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kn V 52 (text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick); {{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] also appears in the Mycenaean pantheon, but he was certainly not the chief deity.&lt;ref name=Castleden143/&gt;

A collection of "ladies" or "mistresses", ''Po-ti-ni-ja'' (''Potnia'') are named in the Mycenaean scripts. As such, [[Athena]] (''A-ta-na'') appears in an inscription at [[Knossos]] as ''mistress Athena'', similar to a later [[Homer]]ic expression, but in the Pylos tablets she is mentioned without any accompanying word.&lt;ref name="Mylonas159"/&gt; ''Si-to po-ti-ni-ja'' appears to be an agricultural goddess, possibly related to [[Demeter]] of later antiquity,&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Knossos there is the "mistress of the Labyrinth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=92–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "two queens and the king" (''wa-na-ssoi'', ''wa-na-ka-te'') are mentioned in Pylos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|loc=p. 159: "Wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te, (to the two queens and the king). Wanax is best suited to Poseidon, the special divinity of Pylos. The identity of the two divinities addressed as wanassoi, is uncertain."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Goddess ''Pe-re-swa'' mentioned may be related to Persephone.&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mylonas159"&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Mycenaean divinities seem to have no later equivalents, such as Marineus, Diwia and Komawenteia.&lt;ref name=Castleden143/&gt;

===Palaces===
[[File:Tiryns, map of the palace and the surrounding fortifications.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Tiryns]], map of the palace and the surrounding fortifications]]
The palatial structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on the summits of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=Fields19&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved are found in Pylos and Tiryns, while Mycenae and the Menelaion are only partially preserved. In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been only partially exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the [[acropolis of Athens]] has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at [[Dimini]] in Thessaly, possibly ancient [[Iolcos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed by a number of archaeologists to be a palace.&lt;ref name=Fields19/&gt; A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in [[Laconia]], near the modern village of Xirokambi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ταράντου|first=Σοφία|title=Βρήκαν μυκηναϊκό ανάκτορο|publisher=Ethnos.gr|date=28 April 2009|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=3320805&amp;tag=8777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hearth of the megaron of Pylos.jpg|thumb|The hearth of the [[megaron]] of Pylos]]

The palatial structures of mainland Greece share a number of common features.&lt;ref name=Kelder109&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the socio-political aspect of a Mycenaean palace was the [[megaron]], the throne room.&lt;ref name=Fields19/&gt; It was laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns. The throne was generally found on the right-hand side upon entering the room, while the interior of the megaron was lavishly decorated, flaunting images designed intentionally to demonstrate the political and religious power of the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the megaron was provided through a court, which was reached from a [[Propylaea|propylon]].&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; The iconography of the palatial chambers is remarkably uniform throughout Greece. For instance, in Pylos and Tiryns the paintings are focused on marine motifs, providing depictions of octopi, fish and dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the megaron a group of courtyards each opened upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; In general Mycenaean palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt;

Additional common features are shared by the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns;&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; a large court with colonnades lies directly in front of the central megaron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; The staircases in the palace of [[Pylos]] indicate that the palaces had two stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortifications===
[[File:MicenePortaLeoniMura.jpg|thumb|[[Cyclopean masonry]] in the southern walls of Mycenae]]
The construction of defensive structures was closely linked to the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the [[acropolis]] of [[Athens]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]] or on coastal plains, in the case of [[Gla]].&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt; Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt;

[[File:Passageway of the galleries within the walls of Tiryns.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the galleries within the walls of [[Tiryns]]]]

''[[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]]'' is the term normally applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick and weighing several metric tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were roughly fitted together without the use of mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance.&lt;ref name=Fields11&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective [[parapet]] on the outer edge and with hoop-like [[crenellations]].&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; The term ''Cyclopean'' was derived by the latter Greeks of the [[Classical Greece|Classical era]] who believed that only the mythical giants, the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], could have constructed such megalithic structures.&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt; On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt;

Cyclopean fortifications were typical of Mycenaean walls, especially at the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, [[Argos#Ancient|Argos]], [[Chrisso, Phocis#History|Crisa]] and Athens, while smaller boulders are found in [[Midea, Greece|Midea]] and large limestone slabs are found at Gla.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; In the Mycenaean settlements found in [[Epirus]] and [[Cyprus]], Cyclopean-style walls are also present,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tandy|2001|p=20}}: "In LH IBBB (ca. 1310-1190), Mycenaean material culture spread widely throughout coastal and inland Epirus; in this period Mycenaean engagement in Epirus was strongest, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Though the Kiperi tholos may have gone out of use early in LH IIIB, the Cyclopean wall found there, as well as those at Ephyra, Kastriza, and Ayia Eleni, cannot have been built (and probably after) LH IIIB."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iacovou|2013|p=610}}. Iacovou quotes Vassos Karageorghis who states that "The introduction of 'Cyclopean'-type walls at the very beginning of the LC IIIA period at Enkomi, Kition, Sinda and Maa-Palaeokastron was due to the arrival of Mycenaean settlers in Cyprus."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in western Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the citadels, isolated forts were also erected on various strategic locations. The fortification systems also incorporated technical refinements such as secret cisterns, galleries, sally ports and projecting bastions for the protection of gateways.&lt;ref name=Fields10&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the palace of Pylos, although a major center of power, paradoxically appears to have been left without any defensive walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other architectural features===
Mycenaean domestic architecture originates mainly from earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, as well as in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably as a result of a shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine.&lt;ref name=Kelder107&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.&lt;ref name="Kelder109"/&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, some Mycenaean representative buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in [[Gla]] and [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1990|p=288}}; {{harvnb|Shear|2000|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare==
{{Main|Military of Mycenaean Greece}}
The military nature of the Mycenaean Greeks is evident from the numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek [[Linear B]] records.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cline313&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers.&lt;ref name=Cline313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palaima|1999|pp=367–368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Linear B records in the palace of [[Pylos]], every rural community (the ''damos'') was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Replicas of Mycenaean swords and cups.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Replicas of Mycenaean swords and cups]]
Mycenaean armies were initially based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields and in some occasion armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter.&lt;ref name="Cline313"/&gt; The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.&lt;ref name=Howard50&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins.&lt;ref name=Howard50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=306}}; {{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role and contribution of [[war chariot|chariots]] on the battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that chariots were initially used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boar's tusk helmet]] was the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salimbeti23&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the [[Dendra panoply]] (c. 1450–1400 BC) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set of armor made up of several elements of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most features of the later [[Hoplite#Equipment|hoplite panoply]] of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kagan|Viggiano|2013|p=36: "In fact, most of the essential items of the "hoplite panoply" were known to Mycenaean Greece, including the metallic helmet and the single thrusting spear."}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Figure-of-eight" shields were the most common type of Mycenaean shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Mycenaean period, smaller types of shields were adopted, either of completely circular shape, or almost circular with a part cut out from their lower edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and craftwork==

===Vessels===
{{main|Mycenaean pottery}}
[[File:Bull head rhyton Mycenae Grave IV, from Grave Circle A at Mycenae, 16th century BC (Archaeological Museum, Athens).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Silver repoussé [[rhyton]] with gold horns, from [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Grave Circle A]] at Mycenae, 16th century BC (Archaeological Museum, [[Athens]])]]

During the Late Mycenaean period (1400–1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery exhibited similarities spanning a significant area of the Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form of economic and political union centered at Mycenae.&lt;ref name=Castleden135&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as stirrup jars, large bowls, [[alabastron]], [[krater]] and stemmed cups (or [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylikes]]) resembling champagne glasses.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt;

Stirrup jars (Linear B: ''ka-ra-re-u'', khlareus; "oil vessel"), specifically, were first invented on the island of Crete during the 16th century BC and used widely by the Mycenaeans from 1400 BC onward for transporting and storing wine and oil; the jars were usually pear-shaped or globular.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; As for stemmed cups (or kylikes), they evolved from Ephyraean goblets and a large quantity was discovered at a site called the "Potter's Shop" located in Zygouries.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; Mycenaean drinking vessels such as the stemmed cups contained single decorative motifs such as a [[Seashell|shell]], an [[octopus]] or a [[flower]] painted on the side facing away from the drinker.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; The Mycenaean Greeks also painted entire scenes (called "Pictorial Style") on their vessels depicting warriors, chariots, horses and deities reminiscent of events described in Homer's ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|pp=135–137: "Large kraters decorated in Pictorial Style are found almost exclusively in Cyprus, and for a long time it was naturally assumed that they were manufactured there, but a few examples have been found on the Greek mainland, mostly near Mycenae, and it has now been established that they were all manufactured at workshops close to Mycenae, probably at Berbati just to the east of the city, where there are the right clay sources. The ware was probably specifically made for export to Cyprus, where they were used as centerpieces for drinking ceremonies. The decoration appears to have been painted on at high speed and the effect is sometimes crude; Reynold Higgins calls it 'barbarous', which is a fair description, but the scenes showing warriors, horses and chariots can still tell us much about everyday life in Mycenaean Greece, and as much again about Mycenaean religious beliefs and mythology. One krater from Enkomi in Cyprus shows a charioteer with his groom riding along, perhaps into battle, while a long-robed god, Zeus perhaps, stands in his way holding the scales of destiny that will decide his fate. It is an archetypal scene reminiscent of several in the ''Iliad'', where the gods are shown intervening in battle and deciding the outcome."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other items developed by the Mycenaeans include clay lamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Furumark|1941|p=78: "There are two types of Mycenaean lamps. One of these (type 321) has a broad horizontal lip with two opposite depressions for wicks. This type is the clay version of a Minoan stone lamp, known in many examples both from Crete and from the Mainland. The other (type 321 a) has one wick-spout and a handle at the opposite side."}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as metallic vessels such as bronze tripod cauldrons (or basins).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|pp=56, 166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples of vessels in [[faience]] and [[ivory]] are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures and figurines===
The Mycenaean period has not yielded sculpture of any great size. The statuary of the period consists for the most part of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece—in tombs, in settlement debris, and occasionally in cult contexts (Tiryns, Agios Konstantinos on [[Methana]]). The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups which were popular at different periods: the earliest are the Phi-type, which look like the Greek letter phi and their arms give the upper body of the figurine a rounded shape. The Psi-type looks like the letter Greek psi: these have outstretched upraised arms. The latest (12th century BC) are the Tau-type: these figurines look like the Greek letter tau with folded(?) arms at right angles to the body. Most figurines wear a large 'polos' hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|French|1971|pp=101–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are painted with stripes or zigzags in the same manner as the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters. Their purpose is uncertain, but they may have served as both votive objects and toys: some are found in children's graves but the vast majority of fragments are from domestic rubbish deposits.&lt;ref&gt;See account of their use in K.A. and Diana Wardle "The Child's Cache at Assiros, Macedonia", in Sally Crawford and Gillian Shepherd (eds): ''Children, Childhood and Society: Institute for Archaeology and Antiquity Interdisciplinary Studies (Volume I)'' Oxford: Archaeopress, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods (approximately 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi, others at the temple of [[Aphaea]] on Aegina, at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyklae near Sparta), suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature, perhaps as votives, but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägg|Marinatos|1981|loc=Robin Hägg, "Official and Popular Cults in Mycenaean Greece", pp. 35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger male, female or bovine terracotta wheelmade figures are much rarer. An important group was found in the Temple at Mycenae together with coiled clay snakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Taylour|French|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been found at Tiryns and in the East and West Shrines at Phylakopi on the island of Melos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|Mountjoy|Macfarlane|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frescoes===
[[File:Fresco of a Mycenaean woman, circa 1300 BC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Fresco of a Mycenaean woman]]

The painting of the Mycenaean age was much influenced by that of the Minoan age. Fragments of wall paintings have been found in or around the palaces (Pylos, Mycenae, Tiryns) and in domestic contexts (Zygouries).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Immerwahr|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest complete wall painting depicting three female figures, probably goddesses, was found in the so-called "cult center" at Mycenae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylour|1969|pp=91–97}}; {{harvnb|Taylour|1970|pp=270–280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various themes are represented: hunting, [[Bull-leaping|bull leaping]] (tauromachy), battle scenes, processions, etc. Some scenes may be part of mythological narratives, but if so their meaning eludes us. Other frescoes include geometric or stylised motifs, also used on painted pottery (see above).

==Burial practices==
The usual form of burial during this period was inhumation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanagh|Mee|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves in the form of a pit or a stone-lined [[cist]] and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylour|French|Wardle|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alden|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pelon|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this form dates back to the [[Kurgan culture]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1967|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=33–34, 53, 59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewartowski|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|A]] and [[Grave Circle B, Mycenae|B]] belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=53, 107}}; {{harvnb|Anthony|2007|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Treasury of Atreus, 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae-exterior.jpg|200|Treasury of Atreus, 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae-interior.jpg|200|[[Treasury of Atreus]], 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae: exterior (left) and interior (right) view.}}

Beginning also in the Late Helladic period are to be seen communal tombs of rectangular form.  Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish whether the different forms of burial represent a social hierarchization, as was formerly thought, with the [[Beehive tomb|"tholos"]] being the tombs of the elite rulers, the individual tombs those of the leisure class, and the communal tombs those of the people. Cremations increased in number over the course of the period, becoming quite numerous in the last phase of the Mycenaean era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papadimitriou|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tholos was introduced during the early 15th century as the new and more imposing form of elite burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive tombs of the Mycenaean era are the monumental royal tombs of Mycenae, undoubtedly intended for the royal family of the city. The most famous is the [[Treasury of Atreus]], a [[Beehive tomb|tholos]]. A total of nine of such tholos tombs are found in the region of Mycenae, while six of them belong to a single period (Late Helladic IIa, c. 1400-1300 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that different dynasties or factions may have competed through conspicuous burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graziado|1991|pp=403–440}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In circa 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the [[Minoan civilization]] its syllabic writing system (i.e., [[Linear A]]) and developed their own [[syllabic script]] known as [[Linear B]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Linear-A|title=Linear A and Linear B|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linear B script was utilized by the Mycenaean palaces in Greece for administrative purposes where economic transactions were recorded on clay tablets and some pottery in the [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean dialect]] of the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The Linear B tablets were first discovered in [[Crete]] by English archaeologist [[Sir Arthur Evans]] c. 1900 and later deciphered by English architect and cryptographer [[Michael Ventris]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Evans|title=Sir Arthur Evans|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Ventris|title=Michael Ventris|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventris's discovery of an archaic Greek dialect in the Linear B tablets demonstrated that Mycenaean Greek was "the oldest known Greek dialect, elements of which survived in Homer’s language as a result of a long oral tradition of epic poetry."&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 8th century BC, after the end of the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]], Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan [[Epic Cycle]].&lt;ref name=Castleden2&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Greeks]] of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2004|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The legends of [[Homeric epics|Homer's Epics]] were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt; At this time, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of [[Mycenae]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sansone|2004|loc="Greece in the Bronze Age", pp. 7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the ''Iliad'' by identifying the places described by Homer.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt;

As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Pantheon]] of later antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the language of the Mycenaeans offers the first written evidence of [[Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a significant part of the Mycenaean vocabulary can also be found in modern English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallance|first1=Richard|title=Did you Know you Speak Mycenaean Greek? You do!|url=https://www.academia.edu/12633620|website=academia.edu|date=2015|accessdate=30 March 2016|quote=Whether we realize it or not, not only are tens of thousands of English words direct derivatives of ancient Greek, but some are derived even from Mycenaean Greek, which makes them very ancient indeed!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean Greeks were also pioneers in the field of [[engineering]], launching large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the [[Roman architecture|Roman period]], such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the [[Discharging arch#History|relieving triangle]].&lt;ref name=Castleden231&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.&lt;ref name=Castleden231/&gt;

Schmidt|Reinhold Schmidt]], [[Howard Menger]], and Stephen Darbishire.]]

In [[Ufology]], [[conspiracy theory]], [[science fiction]], and [[comic book]] stories, claims or stories have circulated linking [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s to [[Nazi Germany]]. The German UFO theories describe supposedly successful attempts to develop advanced aircraft or spacecraft prior to and during [[World War II]], and further assert the post-war survival of these craft in secret underground bases in [[New Swabia|Antarctica]], South America, or the United States, along with their creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Goodrick-Clarke | first = Nicholas | year= 2002| title= Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity| publisher = New York University Press| isbn=0-8147-3124-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these theories and fictional stories, various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft such as ''Rundflugzeug'', ''Feuerball'', ''Diskus'', ''Haunebu'', ''Hauneburg-Gerät'', ''V7'', ''[[Vril]]'', ''Kugelblitz'' (not related to the [[Kugelblitz|self-propelled anti-aircraft gun of the same name]]), ''Andromeda-Gerät'', ''Flugkreisel'', ''Kugelwaffe'', and ''Reichsflugscheibe'' have all been referenced.

Accounts appear as early as 1950, likely inspired by historical German development of specialized engines such as [[Viktor Schauberger]]'s "Repulsine" around the time of World War II. Elements of these claims have been widely incorporated into various works of fictional and purportedly non-fictional media, including video games and documentaries, often mixed with more substantiated information.

German UFO literature very often conforms largely to documented history on the following points:

* Nazi Germany claimed the territory of [[New Swabia]] in [[Antarctica]], sent an expedition there in 1938, and planned others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Journals | publisher = Cambridge | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=B6356AB01A1A845DF9DE9BBF66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nazi Germany conducted research into advanced propulsion technology, including [[rocket]]ry, Viktor Schauberger's engine research, [[Horten Ho 229|flying wing craft]] and the [[Sack AS-6|Arthur Sack A.S.6]] experimental circular winged aircraft.
* Some UFO sightings during [[World War II]], particularly those known as [[foo fighter]]s, were thought by the Allies to be prototype enemy aircraft designed to harass [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft through electromagnetic disruption; a technology similar to today's [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) weapons.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Early claims==
In World War II, the so-called "[[foo fighter]]s", a variety of unusual and anomalous aerial phenomena, were witnessed by both Axis and Allied personnel. While some foo fighter reports were dismissed as the misperceptions of troops in the heat of combat, others were taken seriously, and leading scientists such as [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] began to investigate them.{{Sfn | Chester | 2007}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = April 2013}}  In at least some cases, Allied intelligence and commanders suspected that foo fighters reported in the European theater represented advanced German aircraft or weapons, particularly given that Germans had already developed such technological innovations as [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] rockets and the first operational jet-powered [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter planes, and that a minority of foo fighters seemed to have inflicted damage to allied aircraft.{{Sfn | Chester | 2007}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = April 2013}}

Similar sentiments regarding German technology resurfaced in 1947 with the first wave of flying saucer reports after [[Kenneth Arnold]]'s widely reported close encounter with nine crescent-shaped objects moving at a high velocity. Personnel of [[Project Sign]], the first U.S. Air Force UFO investigation group, noted that the advanced [[flying wing]] aeronautical designs of the German [[Horten brothers]] were similar to some UFO reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Michael D. Swords| last = Swords | first = Michael D | contribution = UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War | pages = 82–122 | title = UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge | editor-first = David M | editor-last = Jacobs | publisher = University Press of Kansas | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the first head of [[Project Blue Book]] (Project Sign's follow-up investigation) wrote:
{{Quote |When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Childress| first1 = David Hatcher | last2 = Shaver | first2 = Richard S | title= Lost Continents &amp; the Hollow Earth | quote = Nazi UFOs are misconceptions (recorded proof) of Zeppelins flying over the sea side of Germany | isbn = 0-932813-63-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these early speculations and reports were limited primarily to military personnel, the earliest assertion of German flying saucers in the [[mass media]] appears to have been an article which appeared in the Italian newspaper ''[[Il Giornale d'Italia]]'' in early 1950. Written by Professor [[Giuseppe Belluzzo]], an Italian scientist and a former Italian Minister of National Economy under the Mussolini regime, it claimed that "types of flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942". Belluzzo also expressed the opinion that "some great power is launching discs to study them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Flying Discs 'Old Story', Says Italian | newspaper = [[Daily Mirror]] | date = 24 March 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Die Glocke|Bell UFO]] was among the first flying objects to be connected with the Nazis.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It apparently had occult markings on it and it was also rumoured to have been very similar to a Wehrmacht document about a vertical take off aircraft. It is directly related to the [[Kecksburg UFO incident|supposed crash of a bell-shaped object that occurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, USA on December 9, 1965]]. The same month, German engineer [[Rudolf Schriever]] gave an interview to German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in which he claimed that he had designed a craft powered by a circular plane of rotating turbine blades {{convert |49|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at [[BMW]]'s Prague works until April 1945, when he fled [[Czechoslovakia]]. His designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his craft for "a foreign power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=1950-03-31| title=Luftfahrt| work=Der Spiegel| url=http://www.naziufos.com/NEWSCL/SCHRIEV.HTM| accessdate=2006-12-01| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211214416/http://www.naziufos.com/NEWSCL/SCHRIEV.HTM| archivedate=2006-12-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unmuseum.org/germufo.htm |title=Nazi Flying Saucers |publisher=The UnMuseum | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate interview with ''Der Spiegel'' in October 1952 he said that the plans were stolen from a farm he was hiding in near [[Regen]] on 14 May 1945. There are other discrepancies between the two interviews that add to the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first =Brad | last = Turner |url= http://www.german-discs.net/builders/schriever.php |title=Rudolf Schriever |publisher=German Discs | accessdate= 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many skeptics have doubted that such a Bell UFO was actually designed or ever built.&lt;ref name=secret&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1#ixzz0uXSU8IRo|publisher=[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|first=Patrick J|last=Kiger|title=Nazi Secret Weapons|accessdate=July 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226104846/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1#ixzz0uXSU8IRo|archivedate=February 26, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, when [[Avro Canada]] announced that it was developing the VZ-9-AV [[Avrocar]], a circular jet aircraft with an estimated speed of {{convert |1500|mph|abbr =on}}, German engineer Georg Klein claimed that such designs had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:

* A non-rotating disk developed at [[Breslau]] by [[V-2 rocket]] engineer Richard Miethe, which was captured by the Soviets, while Miethe fled to the US via France, and ended up working for Avro.
* A disk developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl at Prague, which consisted of a ring of moving turbine blades around a fixed cockpit. Klein claimed that he had witnessed this craft's first manned flight on 14 February 1945, when it managed to climb to {{convert |12400|m|abbr =on}} in 3 minutes and attained a speed of {{convert|2200|km/h|abbr=on}} in level flight.

Aeronautical engineer [[Roy Fedden]] remarked that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war. Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945: {{quote|I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they (the Germans) had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonnews.net/hitlersufo.html Hitler's UFO, Burlington UFO and Paranormal Research and Educational Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

==Later claims==

===''The Morning of the Magicians''===
''Le Matin des Magiciens'' ("[[The Morning of the Magicians]]"), a 1960 book by [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]], made many spectacular claims about the [[Vril Society]] of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last1 = Pauwels | first1 = Louis | year = 1967| first2 = Jacques | last2 = Bergier |title= Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: Von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft| isbn=3-442-11711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later writers, including [[Jan van Helsing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last=Van Helsing| first=Jan| year= 1993| title = Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20. Jahrhundert| publisher=Ewert| location=Rhede, Emsland| isbn = 3-89478-069-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last=Van Helsing| first=Jan| year=1997| title = Unternehmen Aldebaran. Kontakte mit Menschen aus einem anderen Sonnensystem| publisher=Ewertlag| location = Lathen | isbn = 3-89478-220-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | language = German | last1 = Jürgen-Ratthofer| first1 =Norbert | first2 = Ralf | last2 = Ettl| year=1992| title=Das Vril-Projekt. Der Endkampf um die Erde | publisher = self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Terziski]], have built on their work, connecting the Vril Society with UFOs. Among their claims, they imply that the society may have made contact with an alien race and dedicated itself to creating spacecraft to reach the aliens. In partnership with the [[Thule Society]] and the [[Nazi Party]], the Vril Society developed a series of flying disc prototypes. With the Nazi defeat, the society allegedly retreated to a base in Antarctica and vanished into the hollow Earth to meet up with the leaders of an advanced race inhabiting inner Earth.

===Ernst Zündel's marketing ploy===

When German [[Holocaust denier]] [[Ernst Zündel]] started [[Samisdat Publishers]] in the 1970s, he initially catered to the [[UFOlogy]] community, which was then at its peak of public acceptance. His books claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, from which the Nazis hoped to conquer the Earth and possibly the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Friedrich| first= Christof| year = 1974 | authorlink =Ernst Zündel| title=UFOs – Nazi Secret Weapon?| publisher=Samisdat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zündel also sold (for $9999) seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the [[hollow earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/expedition.html | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | last = Friedrich | first=Christof| orig-year= 1974| title= Samisdat Hollow Earth Expedition | year = 1979| work= The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who interviewed Zündel claim that he privately admitted it was a deliberate hoax to build publicity for Samisdat, although he still defended it as late as 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/ | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | title = Ernst Zündel's Flying Saucers | work = The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/z/zundel.ernst/zundelgrams/ftp.py?people/z/zundel.ernst/zundelgrams//2002/zgram.021201 | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | last = Zündel | first= Ernst | title=Zündelgram| date=2002-12-01| work=The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miguel Serrano's book===
In 1978, [[Miguel Serrano]], a [[Chile]]an diplomat and Nazi sympathizer, published {{Citation | language = Spanish| title = El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico |trans-title=The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism}}, in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] was an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] and was, at that time, communing with [[Hyperborean]] gods in an underground Antarctic base in [[New Swabia]]. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the [[Fourth Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | language = German | last = Serrano| first=Miguel| year= 1978| title= Das goldene Band: esoterischer Hitlerismus |trans-title=The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism | isbn = 3-926179-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[popular culture]], this alleged UFO fleet is referred to as the ''Nazi flying saucers from Antarctica''.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=October 2015}}

===Richard Chase===
According to a 1979 interview conducted by FBI agent [[Robert Ressler]], imprisoned [[serial killer]] [[Richard Chase]] believed or claimed to believe due to his schizophrenia that Nazi UFOs had extorted him into committing his murders under threat to his own life. Chase further claimed that prison officials in league with the Nazis were poisoning his food, and he asked Ressler to provide him with a radar gun, with which he could apprehend his enemies. On December 26, 1980, Chase was found dead in his cell. An autopsy found that he committed suicide with an overdose of prescribed antidepressants that he had saved over several weeks.

==In popular culture==
* In 1947, [[Robert A. Heinlein]] published ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'', a science fiction novel featuring a German moon base.
* ''[[Iron Sky]]'' (2012): a [[science fiction]] [[black comedy]] about Nazis who left Earth from their hidden base in Antarctica and established a secret fortress on the [[Far side of the Moon|dark side of the Moon]]. After Germany's defeat in 1945, the Nazis vowed to return to Earth "in peace," and they finally return in the year 2018, but with a full invasion force of flying saucers in order to finally defeat the Allies and restore [[Nazi Germany]]. During their invasion, they end up battling with the [[President of the United States]] (who in the film resembles [[Sarah Palin]]) and unintentionally cause a worldwide nuclear war when every space-faring nation on Earth lays claim to the Nazis' powerful [[Helium-3]] resources on the Moon.

[[Image:GriotsSambala.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Griots.]]
Circa 1230s-1600s, the '''Mali''' '''Empire''' was created in Western Africa along the Niger River. Often associated with being founded by [[Sunjata Keita]], the history of Mali is extremely based on oral history. The story of the founder of Mali, Sunjata Keita, is largely based on oral history. Oral history may be defined as the preservation and interpretation of historical, cultural or personal experiences by way of a speaker. In Mali, such a speaker can be described as a poet, a storyteller, a praise singer or a musician. A large amount of Mali’s history is transferred via oral historians. Such oral historians in Mali are known as '''griots, Jalis, and Jelis'''. The origins of oral history in Mali may be traced back to the story of Sunjata Keita. Modern-day oral history in Mali has transformed from the history based griots to a more contemporary musical and negotiator based griots. The current state of oral history in Mali has travelled to other realms like popular culture and politics.

==What is a griot?==
One cannot become a [[Griot]]; one must be born into a family of griots to hold that position. Sometimes, a key aspect to signify who is a griot can be found in the last name. Jeliyas are similar to griots but are not born into a griot family. Jeliya described as the "art of the griot" refers to a type of "musical and verbal artist".&lt;ref name=Jeliya&gt;[http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php "Jeliya- The Art of Jeli (Griot)".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920202539/http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelis have an "exclusive right to play the kora".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; Jelis are similar to griots because they also recount history but the jelis role is to "Sing and recount Mande social and political life".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; In reference to a griot, griots are only supposed to marry other griots. Like jelis, griots in Mali often use instruments and music to recite history which ultimately renders the history a performance and not just a story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ias.umn.edu/2012/10/11/ryan-skinner/ Ryan Skinner discusses griots (and other matters) in an interview with Peter Shea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral history in the Mali Empire==
In the '''Mali Empire''', an evident example of '''oral history''' is the Sunjata Keita or [[Sundiata Keita]] story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong representation of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history can be traced back to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of ''Sunjata'' writes:
{{quotation |
		After that had happened they went into the circumcision shed.
		After they had come out of there,
		It was not long before his father died.
		Sunjata announced, ‘As for myself,
		However extensive my father’s property may be, 
		I want no part of it except the griots.’
		They asked him, ‘Do you want the griots?’
		They said, Leave it; 
		A person who has nothing will not have griots for long.’
		The griots said, ‘Since he has let all his inheritance go, 
		And says that it is only us that he wants,
		We will not abandon him.
		If he does not die, we shall not desert him.’
		The griots were at his side.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, Bamba, and Banna Kanute (1974). ''Sunjata.'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 122-135.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Suso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The ''Sunjata'' story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it [father’s property] except the griots”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We [griots] will not abandon him”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In ''Sunjata'', Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of ''Sunjata'', '''Bala Faaseega Kuyate''' accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes:
		&lt;poem&gt;"A day will come
		When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your
		deserted town.
		He says here is your gold.’
		When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; 
		Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho,
		And his younger brother,
		And Bala Faaseega Kuyate
		Rose up and went.
		When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way,
		They had gone far into the bush,
		And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‘I
		Am terribly hungry.’
		Sunjata said, ‘Wait here.’
		He went into a clump of thick bush,
		He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh
		and he cut some off.
		When he had cut it into thin strips, he cooked it,
		Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg,
		He came back,
		And he said to Bala, ‘Here is some meat’".&lt;ref&gt;Suso, pp. 432-451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.

Not only were griots used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the villages, but oral historians and griots are also an important cultural facet in Mali in terms of language. Because oral history, is exactly as the name describes, a means of passing history verbally, language is also passed on by oral historians.

==Skills of oral historians in modern Mali==
In present-day Mali, oral historians / griots are sometimes seen as “intermediaries” between two parties. Oral historians in modern Mali often act as mediators between those from different political parties. [[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jan Jansen]] in ''The Griot’s Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'' discusses the role and skills of oral historians in modern-day Mali:
{{quotation |
		"‘Being sent’ is a strategy that is used often in Mande.
		It is a way to create a space for negotiation. Griots are
		conscious of their role as intermediaries, a role which 
		necessitates contact with both parties for whom they
		act as negotiators. They deliberately keep the parties
		apart so that they do not encounter each other, unless
		at a reconciliation festivity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jansen, Jan]] (2000). ''The Griot's Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'', New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He writes about “being sent” as a strategy for modern-day griots. Similarly to griots during the Mali Empire, modern-day griots must also pass messages between different parties. The skill of “being sent” allows for “negotiation” to occur between parties that may not have negotiated without the help of griots. The oral historians understand that their role does not merely rest on capturing and narrating history, but their role goes as far as encompassing negotiator between two different parties with distinct ideals. Oral historians in modern-day Mali provide a source of communication between such parties. Not only do oral historians chronicle history but they also create a means to communicate. Once the “negotiator” / oral historian completes his goal of mediating tensions between the different parties, the parties are able to have a “reconciliation festivity,” the griots position as both a negotiator and historian are exemplified. Throughout Western Africa and Africa as a continent, oral historians act as mediators between conflicting parties. Oral historians are often essential to solve certain problems. Jansen’s work provides a detailed account of other skills that oral historians / griots need in modern-day Mali. Jansen describes a griot’s skills as a means to “master and manipulate the processes of ‘heating’ and ‘cooling down’ social situations”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the skills that Jansen describes are:
# 	Don’t [initially] let the parties meet
# 	Don’t [initially] allow parties to talk directly to each other
# 	Repetitive talking
# 	Slowing down of negotiations

Because oral historians in modern Mali are often used as negotiators, the above stated skills ease the process of solving problems between the different political parties. Oral historians in modern Mali acting as negotiators do not allow the parties to meet until the problem at hand is solved. The reasoning behind not allowing the parties to initially meet acts as a way to ease the anger members of the conflicting parties may feel toward each other. Jansen writes: “[a member of a conflicting party] must never express his opinions to the person he is in conflict with since this person will die of anger”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the job of the griot to keep both parties separate to eliminate the chance of this anger occurring. Similarly to the reason why the griot does not allow both parties to meet initially, the griot does not allow both parties to meet as a means to eliminate tensions that can occur if both parties were to meet. The skill of repetitive talking that Jansen lists is used for “serious matters”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44&gt;Jansen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen writes:
		"Serious matters are not left to only one person to communicate.
		A small group is created in order to communicate the message. 
		The messenger asks a member of the group to transmit a certain
		message to the person to whom the message is directed. The
		message is then transmitted from person to person until it reaches
		its destination."&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; 

The repetitive talking of oral history transforms the message being passed into a “supra-personal phenomenon” and allows the message to “gain a semblance of authority”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; Likewise, the repetitive nature of oral history transforms messages and creates similar yet slightly different versions of historical events. Jansen describes “slowing down negotiations” as essential to appease both sides of conflicting parties.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen’s presentation of griots in modern Mali as messengers depicts the transformation of oral historians over time. During the Mali Empire, oral historians often were limited to working with a specific family or emperor but in current Mali, oral historians are no longer limited but can act as messengers between various political parties or other groups.

==Modern-day relations between griots and nobles in Mali==
The relationship between griots and nobles may appear to be a difficult one to understand. As seen through the relationship described between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate, the noble and griot relationship is sometimes represented as a partnership. Dr. Barbara G. Hoffman, an associate professor of Anthropology at [[Cleveland State University]], discusses in her book ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande'' the relationship between griots and nobles. She writes that “tension is often expressed through nobles’ criticism of griots’ “empty speech” or griots’ disdain for nobles lack of self-knowledge”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53&gt;Hoffman, Barbara (2000). ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While griots take pride in understanding themselves and life around them, nobles are often more focused on worldly aspects. Despite the relationship that is suggested in ''Sunjata'', the relationship between nobles and griots can be seen as extremely different from that of loyalty and partnership. Hoffman views the relationship between griots and nobles as showing a sharp distinction between castes. Hoffman writes, “This [the caste system] was a central issue for the griots and nobles present at this Kita celebration. They generated social difference and the reinforcement of social boundaries through a repertoire of strategies for recreating old social structures as well as for creating new ones”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53 /&gt; In modern Mali, griots are often seen as being a part of a lower caste then nobles despite the help and history they provide to nobles and society. In Hoffman's work addresses the position of oral historians in  castes "Mande-style".&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman writes, "Living up to one's caste ideals is a source of pride in Mande; violating them a cause for disgrace." The position of griots in the Mande caste system was that of extremely lower stature then the nobles griots and oral historians have a tendency to work for. Oral historians molded their way into the caste system and although they are of a lower caste then nobles, they are extremely influential in Mali. In ''Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande'', David C. Conrad also discusses the relationship between nobles and griots, writing: "Another revealing aspect of the relationship between nobles and griots is the asymmetry of their mutual accountability. For example, nobles almost never blame individual griots for the general character of the group".&lt;ref name=Conrad29&gt;Conrad, David C. (1995). '' Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad then goes on to describe how griots "openly criticize nobles in public as well as in private".&lt;ref name=Conrad29 /&gt; Although griots are seen as being inferior to nobles, griots have no issue criticizing the faults of the family they work for. Such a willingness to criticize emphasizes the fact that griots do have in Mali despite their position in the caste system. Also included in Conrad's book is Cherif Keita's essay "Jaliya in the Modern World: A Tribute to Banzumana Sissoko and Massa Makan Diabate", in which Cherif Keita presents a "tribute to contemporary bards".&lt;ref name=Conrad16&gt;Conrad, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Keita praises the griots and claims that griots "have contributed positively to toward the building of a modern nation-state".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Contrary to beliefs that griots were seen as a part of a lower class, Keita presents an "aristocratic view of contemporary griots".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Keita's perspective on griots provides a different outlook on the position of griots in modern Mali. Although griots are looked at as being a part of a low caste, griots have added to cultural and historical modern Mali society.

==Popular modern-day griots in Mali==
In modern-day Mali, griots are often singers or musicians. For example, [[Abdoulaye Diabaté]], a singer from Mali, was born into a family of griots in 1956. Diabaté has a plethora of experience in contemporary and popular music. [[Baba Sissoko]] is also considered a Malian griot because he was born into a family of griots. Another griot from Mali, [[Toumani Diabaté]], also has a plethora of experience in other forms of performing. Toumani Diabaté has experience in flamenco, blues and jazz.

[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|Water covers about 71% of Earth's surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

==Possible sources==

===Extraplanetary sources===
[[Comet]]s, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, or water-rich [[meteoroid]]s ([[protoplanet]]s) from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]] colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans. [[Asteroid]]s&lt;ref name="SA-20180425"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daly |first1=R.

S. et al. |title=Organic matter in extraterrestrial water-bearing salt crystals |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao3521 |date=10 January 2018 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume=4 |number=1, eaao3521 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao3521 |accessdate=11 January 2018 |bibcode=2018SciA....4O3521C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-enough [[planetesimal]]s were heated by the decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water in the development of Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Planetary differentiation}}
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. As cooling continued, [[subduction]] and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=N.

Study of [[zircon]]s has found that liquid water must have existed as long ago as 4.404 ± 0.008 [[year#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]], very soon after the formation of Earth.&lt;ref name="Wilde"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilde S.A., Valley J.W., Peck W.H. and Graham C.M.|year=2001|title=Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago|journal=Nature|volume=409|url=http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf|doi=10.1038/35051550|pmid=11196637|issue=6817|pages=175–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwrses.anu.edu.au/admin/index.php?p=harrison |title=ANU - Research School of Earth Sciences - ANU College of Science - Harrison |publisher=Ses.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060621100255/http://wwwrses.anu.edu.au/admin/index.php?p=harrison |archivedate=2006-06-21 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.anu.edu.au/mac/Media/Media_Releases/_2005/_November/_181105harrisoncontinents.asp |title=ANU - OVC - MEDIA - MEDIA RELEASES - 2005 - NOVEMBER - 181105HARRISONCONTINENTS |publisher=Info.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/cool_early/cool_early_home.html |title=A Cool Early Earth |publisher=Geology.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the presence of an atmosphere. The [[Cool early Earth]] theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37302">{{Marxism}}
'''Parametric determinism''' is a [[Marxist]] interpretation of the course of history. It was formulated by [[Ernest Mandel]] and can be viewed as one variant of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]] or as a [[philosophy of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Die Dialektik von Produktivkraften, Produktionsverhaltenissen und Klassenkampf neben Kategorien der Latenz und des Parametrischen Determinismus in der Materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung". In: ''Die Versteinerten Verhaltenisse zum tanzen Bringen. Beitrage zur Marxistischen Theorie Heute''. Berlin: Dietz Verlag, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article critical of the [[analytical Marxism]] of [[Jon Elster]], Mandel explains the idea as follows:
{{Quotation|Dialectical determinism as opposed to mechanical, or formal-logical determinism, is also parametric determinism; it permits the adherent of [[historical materialism]] to understand the real place of human action in the way the historical process unfolds and the way the outcome of social crises is decided. Men and women indeed make their own history. The outcome of their actions is not mechanically predetermined. Most, if not all, historical crises have several possible outcomes, not innumerable fortuitous or arbitrary ones; that is why we use the expression 'parametric determinism' indicating several possibilities within a given set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1989/xx/nosense.htm Ernest Mandel, "How To Make No Sense of Marx" (1989) in: ''Analyzing Marxism. New essays on Analytical Marxism'', edited by Robert Ware &amp; Kai Nielsen, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 15, 1989, The University of Calgary Press, pp. 105–132.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formal rationality and dialectical reason==

In formal-logical determinism, human action is considered ''either'' rational, and hence logically explicable, ''or else'' arbitrary and random (in which case human actions can be comprehended at best only as patterns of statistical distributions, i.e. as degrees of variability relative to some constants). But in dialectical determinism, human action may be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''determinate'', hence reasonable, even although it is ''not'' explicable exclusively in terms of deductive inference. The action selected by people from a limited range of options may not be the "most logical" or "most optimal" one, but it can be shown to be ''non-arbitrary'' and ''reasonable'' under the circumstances, if the total context is considered.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs, ''Evolutionary explanation in the social sciences: an emerging paradigm.'' Totown (New Jersey): Rowman and Littlefield, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

What this means is that, in human situations, typically ''several "logics" are operating at the same time'' which together determine the outcomes of those situations:

*the logic of the actors themselves, in their consciousness and actions.
*the logic of the given parameters constraining their behaviour.
*the logic of the interactive (reflexive) relationship between actors and their situation.

If one considered only one of these aspects, one might judge people's actions "irrational", but if all three aspects are taken into account, what people do may appear "very reasonable". [[Dialectical]] theory aims to demonstrate this, by linking different "logical levels" together as a total picture, in a non-arbitrary way. "Different logical levels" means that particular determinants regarded as irrelevant at one level of analysis are excluded, but are relevant and included at another level of analysis with a somewhat different (or enlarged) set of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "Partially independent variables and internal logic in classical Marxist economic analysis’", in ''Social Science Information'', vol. 24 no. 3 (1985), pp. 487–88 (reprinted in Ulf Himmelstrand, ''Interfaces in Economic &amp; Social Analysis'', London 1992).[gesd.free.fr/mandel85.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;—depending on the kind of problem being investigated.

For example, faced with a situation, the language which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well that at least some of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can  coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people do it all the time, and think it perfectly "reasonable". For another example, people will say "you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself" or "on the ground." What they mean is that the meaning of the totality of interacting factors involved can only be understood by experiencing them. Standing outside the situation, things seem irrational, but being there, they appear very reasonable.

Dialectical theory does not mean that, in analyzing the complexity of human action, inconvenient facts are simply and arbitrarily set aside. It means, rather, that those facets of the subjectmatter which are not ''logically required'' at a given stage of the analysis are set aside. Yet, and this is the point, as the analysis progresses, the previously disregarded aspects are integrated step by step into the analysis, in a consistent way. The proof of the validity of the procedure is that, at the end, the theory has made the subjectmatter fully self-explanatory, since all salient aspects have been given their appropriate place in the theory, so that all of it becomes comprehensible, without resort to shallow tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This result can obviously be achieved only after the research has already been done, and the findings can be arranged in a convincing way. A synthesis cannot be achieved without a preceding analysis. So dialectical analysis is not a "philosopher's stone" that provides a quick short-cut to the "fount of wisdom", but a mode of presenting findings of the analysis after knowledge has been obtained through inquiry and research, and dialectical relationships have been verified. Because only then does it become clear where the story should begin and end, so that all facets are truly explained. According to Ernest Mandel, "Marx's method is much richer than the procedures of ' successive concretization' or 'approximation' typical of academic science."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism''. London: NLB, 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mainstream social theory, the problem of "several logics" in human action is dealt with by [[game theory]], a kind of modelling which specifies the choices and options which actors have within a defined setting, and what the effects are of their decisions. The main limitation of that approach is, that the model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based, while the choice of assumptions is often eclectic or fairly arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun P. Hargreaves-Heap and Yanis Varoufakis, ''Game theory. A critical introduction.'' (2nd ed.). London: Routledge, 2004. Steve Keen, "My Friend Yanis, The Greek Minister Of Finance." ''Forbes'', 31 january 2015.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/01/31/my-friend-yanis-the-greek-minister-of-finance/]&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectical theory attempts to overcome this problem, by paying attention to the sources of assumptions, and by integrating the assumptions in a consistent way.

==Making history==

One common problem in [[history|historical analysis]] is to understand to what extent the results of human actions can be attributed to free choices and decisions people made (or [[free will]]), and to what extent they are a product of social or natural forces beyond their control.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sherman, "Marx and determinism". ''Journal of Economic Issues'', Vol. 15 No. 1, 1981, pp. 61–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve this problem theoretically, Mandel suggests that in almost any human situation, some factors ("[[parameter]]s") are beyond the control of individuals, while some other conditions are under their control (arguably, one group of people could "impose parameters" on another, analogous to parents imposing constraints on children). Some things can under the circumstances be changed by human action, according to [[choice]], but others cannot or will not be, and can thus be regarded as constants. A variable can vary, yet it cannot vary in any direction whatever but only within the given parameters. In a general sense, a "parameter" is a given condition imposed on a situation, or a controlled variable, but more specifically it refers to a condition which, in some way, ''limits the amount and type of variability there can be''.

Those given, objective parameters which are beyond people's control (and thus cannot normally be changed by them) ''limit'' the realm of possibilities in the future; they ''rule out'' some conceivable future developments or alternatively make them ''more likely to happen''. In that sense human action is "determined" and "determinate". If that wasn't so, then it would be impossible to predict anything much about human behaviour.

Some of these parameters refer to limits imposed by the physical world, others to limits imposed by the social set-up or [[social structure]] that individuals and groups operate within. The dominant [[ideology]] or [[religion]] could also be a given parameter. If for example most people follow a certain faith, this shapes their whole cultural life, and is something to be reckoned with that isn't easily changed.

At the same time, however, the given parameters cannot usually determine ''in total'' what an individual or group will do, because they have at least some (and sometimes a great deal) of personal or behavioural autonomy. They can think about their situation, and make some free choices and decisions about what they will do, within the framework of what is objectively possible for them (the choices need not be ''rational'' or ''fully conscious'' ones, they could just be ''non-arbitrary'' choices influenced by emotions and desires). Sentient (self-aware) organisms, of which human beings are the most evolved sort, are able to vary their own response to given situations according to internally evaluated and decided options.

In this sense, [[Karl Marx]] had written:

{{Quotation|"People make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm Karl Marx, ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The past" (what really happened before, as distinct from its results in the present) is not something which can be changed at all in the present, only reinterpreted, and therefore the past is a given constant which delimits what can possibly happen in the present and in the future. If the future seems relatively "open-ended" that is just because in the time-interval between now and the future, new options and actions could significantly alter what exactly the future will be. Yet the variability of possible outcomes in the future is not infinite, but delimited by what happened before.

==Ten implications==
Ten implications of this view are as follows:
*At any point in time, the outcomes of an historical process are partly predetermined, and partly uncertain because they depend on what human choices and decisions will be made in the present. Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.
*While the past and the present rule out some courses of action, a human choice is always possible between a finite number of realistic options, which often enables the experienced analyst to specify the "most likely scenarios" of what could happen in the future. Some things cannot happen, and some things are more likely to happen than others.
*Once an important choice has been made and acted upon, this will have an effect on the realm of possibilities; in particular, it will shift to a greater or lesser extent the parameters delimiting what can happen in the future. Thus, once "a train of events has been set in motion", it will foreclose other possibilities, and also it might open up some new ones. If masses of people make important new choices, whether in response to circumstances or in response to a new idea, a ''qualitative change'' occurs; in that case, most people begin to behave differently.
*The process of history is both determined, in that the given parameters delimit the possible outcomes, but also open-ended, insofar as human action (or inaction) can change the historical outcomes within certain limits. Human history-making is therefore a reciprocal interaction between what people do, and the given circumstances.
*To some extent at least, it is possible to predict with useful accuracy what will happen in the future, if one has sufficient experience, knowledge, and insight into the relevant causal factors at work as well as how they are related. This may be a work of science or sustained practical experience. In turn, future perspectives can importantly influence human action in the present.
*In historical analysis and portrayals, the analytical challenge is to understand what part of a course of events is attributable to conscious human actions and decisions, what part is shaped by the combination of given circumstances in which the human actors had to act, and what exactly is the relationship between them (the link between the "part" and the "whole").
*Because the ability to prove historical assessments scientifically is limited, [[ideology]], a [[mind-set]] or a social [[mentality]] about the state of the world typically plays an important role in the perspectives people develop (Mandel refers here to an idea by [[Lucien Goldmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The role of the individual in history: the case of world war two", in: ''New Left Review'' I-157, May–June 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With hindsight, it may be possible to trace out accurately why events necessarily developed in the way that they did, and not otherwise. But at the time they are happening, this is usually not, or not completely possible, and the [[hope]] (or [[fear]]) for a particular future may play an important role (here Mandel refers to the philosophy of [[Ernst Bloch]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, " Anticipation and Hope as Categories of Historical Materialism", in: ''Historical materialism'', Volume 10, Number 4 / December, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ideology influences whether one looks upon past events as ''failures'' or ''successes'' (as many historians have noted, history is often rewritten by the victors in great historical battles to cast themselves in an especially positive light). There is no "non-partisan" history-writing in this sense, at best we can say the historian had full regard for the known facts pertaining to the given case and frankly acknowledges his biases.
*"History" in general cannot be simply defined as "the past", because it is also "the past living in the present" and "the future living in the present". Historical thinking is not just concerned with what past events led to the present, but also with those elements from the past which are contained in the present and elements that point to the future. It involves both antecedents and consequents, including future effects. Only on that basis can we define how people can "make history" as a conscious [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].
*The main reason for studying history is not because we{{Who|date=April 2017}} should assign praise or blame, or simply because it is interesting, but because we need to study past experience ''to understand the present and the future''. History can be seen as a "laboratory", the lab-record of which shows how, under given conditions, people tried to achieve their goals, and what the results of their experimentations were. This can provide insight into what is likely or unlikely to succeed in future. At the very least, each generation has to come to grips with the experience of the previous generation, as well as educating the future generation.
*The theory of [[historicism]] according to which the historical process as a whole has an overall purpose or [[teleology]] (or "grand design") is rejected. With [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Mandel thought that "'History does nothing... It is people, real, living people who do all that... “history” is not, as it were, a person apart, using people as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of people pursuing their aims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#history|title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, with the proviso that people did so within given parameters not of their own making, allowing us to identify broad historical movements as determinate processes. The historical process is also not a matter of linear progress according to inevitable stages—both progress and regress can occur, and different historical outcomes are possible depending on what people do.

==Perceptions and illusions==
According to the theory of parametric determinism, the "human problem" in this context is usually not that human beings lack free choice or free will, or that they cannot in principle change their situation (at least to some extent), but rather is their ''awareness'' of the options open to them, and their ''belief'' in their own ability to act on them—influenced as they may be, by their ideology, experience and emotions.

Perceptions of what people can change or act upon may vary a great deal, they might overestimate it, or underestimate it. Thus it may take [[science|scientific inquiry]] to find out what perceptions are realistic. By discovering what the determinism is, we can learn better how we can be free. Simply put, we could "bang our head against a wall", but we could also go over the wall, through a door in the wall, or around the wall. At crucial points, humans can "make history" actively with a high awareness of what they are doing, changing the course of history, but they can also "be made by history" to the extent that they passively conform to (or are forced to conform to) a situation which is mostly not of their own making and which they may not understand.

As regards the latter, Mandel referred to the condition of [[Social alienation|alienation]] in the sense of a diminished belief in the ability to have control over one's own life, or feeling estranged from one's real nature and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The Marxist theory of alienation", in: ''International Socialist Review'', Vol. 3, No. 31, 1970, pp.19-23, 49-50.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/xx/alien.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; People might [[reification (Marxism)|reify]] aspects of their situation. They might regard something as inevitable ("God's will") or judge "nothing could be done to prevent it" when the real point is that, for specific reasons, nobody was prepared to do anything about it—something could have been done, but it wasn't. Thus "historical inevitability" can also be twisted into a convenient apology to justify a course of events.

In this process of making choices within a given objective framework of realistic options, plenty of illusions are also possible, insofar as humans may have all kinds of gradations of (maybe false) awareness about their true situation. They may, as Mandel argues, not even be fully aware of what motivates their own actions, quite aside from not knowing fully what the consequences of their actions will be. A revolutionary seeking to overthrow the old order to make way for a new one obviously faces many "unknowns".

Therefore, human action can have ''[[unintended consequence]]s'', including effects which are completely opposite to what was intended.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz D. Kurz, "Das Problem der nichtintendierten Konsequenzen; Zur Politischen Ökonomie von Karl Marx". ''Marx-Engels Jahrbuch'' 2012-13, Internationale Marx-Engels-Stiftung, Berlin: Akademie Verlag GmbH, 2013, pp. 75–122.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that popular illusions can also shape the outcomes of historical events. If most people believe something to be the case, even although it is not true, this fact can also become a parameter limiting what can happen or influencing what will happen.

==Skeptical reply==

Because terrible illusions can occur, some historians are [[skepticism|skeptical]] about the ability of people to change the world for the better in any real and lasting way. [[Postmodernism]] casts doubt on the existence of progress in history as such—if e.g. Egyptians built the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in 2500&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] landed on the [[moon]] in 1969, this represents no progress for humanity.

However, Mandel argued that this skepticism is itself based on perceptions of what people are able to know about their situation and their history. Ultimately, the skeptic believes that it is impossible for people to have sufficient knowledge of a kind that they can really change the human condition for the better, except perhaps in very small ways. It just is what it is. This skeptical view does not necessarily imply a very "deterministic" view of history however; history could also be viewed as an unpredictable [[wikt:Chaos|chaos]] or too complex to fathom.

However, most [[politician]]s and [[political activism|political activists]] (including Mandel himself) at least do not believe that history generally is an unpredictable chaos, because in that case their own standpoints would be purely arbitrary and be ''perceived'' as purely arbitrary. Usually, they would argue, the chaos is limited in space and time, because in perpetual chaos, human life can hardly continue anyway; in that case, people become reactive beasts. Since people mostly do want to [[wiktionary:survival|survive]], they need some order and predictability. One can understand what really happened in history reasonably well, if one tries. Human beings can understand human experience because they are human, and the more relevant experience they obtain, the better they can understand it.

Conscious human action, Mandel argues, is mainly non-arbitrary and practical, it has a certain "logic" to it even if people are not (yet) fully aware of this. The reality they face is ''ordered'' in basic ways, and therefore can be meaningfully understood. Masses of people might go into a "mad frenzy" sometimes that might be difficult to explain in rational terms, but this is the exception, not the rule. What is true is that a situation of chaos and disorder (when nothing in society seems to work properly anymore) can powerfully accentuate the irrational and non-rational aspects of human behaviour. In such situations, people with very unreasonable ideas can rise to power. This is, according to Mandel, part of the explanation of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, Introduction to Leon Trotsky, ''The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany'', Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1971, pp. 9–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical latency and the possibilities for change==

The concept of parametric determinism has as its corollary the concept of ''historical latency''. It is not just that different historical outcomes are possible, but that each epoch of human history contains quite a few different developmental ''potentials''. The indications of these potentials can be empirically identified, and are not simply a speculation about "what could conceivably happen".

But they are ''latent'' factors in the situation, insofar as they will not necessarily be realised or actualised. Their realisation depends on human action, on the recognition of the potential that is there, and the decision to do something about it. Thus, Mandel argues that both [[socialism]] and [[barbarian|barbarism]] exist as broad "latent" developmental possibilities within modern capitalist society, even if they are not realised, and whether and which of these will be realised, depends on human choices and human actions.

Effective action to change society, he argues, has to set out from the real possibilities there are for an alternative way of doing things, not from abstract speculations about a better world. Some things are realistically possible, but not just "anything" is possible. The analytical challenge—often very difficult—is therefore to understand correctly what the real possibilities are, and which course of action would have the most fruitful effect. One can do only what one is able to do and no more, but much depends on choices about how to spend one's energies.

Typically in [[war]]s and [[revolution]]s, when people exert themselves to the maximum and have to improvise, it is discovered that people can accomplish far more than they previously thought they could do (also captured in the saying "necessity is the mother of invention"). The whole way people think is suddenly changed. But in times of [[cultural pessimism]], general exhaustion prevails and people are generally skeptical or cynical about their ability to achieve or change very much at all. If the bourgeoisie beats down the workers and constrains their freedom, so that workers have to work more and harder for less and less pay, pessimistic moods can prevail for quite some time. If, on the other hand, the bourgeois economy is expanding, the mood of society can become euphoric, and people believe that just about anything is possible. A famous leftwing slogan in [[May 1968]] was "tout est possible" ("anything is possible"). Similarly, in the boom of the later 1990s, many people in rich countries believed that all human problems could finally be resolved.

That is just to say that what is possible to achieve can be both pessimistically underestimated and optimistically exaggerated at any time. Truly conservative people will emphasize how little potential there is for change, while rebels, visionaries, progressives and revolutionaries will emphasize how much could be changed. An important role for [[social science|social scientific inquiry]] and [[historiography]] is therefore to relativise all this, and place it in a more objective perspective by looking at the relevant facts.

==Criticisms==

While Mandel himself made some successful predictions about the future of world society (for instance, he is famous for predicting at the beginning of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "The economics of neocapitalism". ''The Socialist Register 1964''. London: Merlin Press, 1964, pp. 56-67.[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/download/5928/2824]&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Milton Friedman]] did, that the [[postwar economic boom]] would end at the close of the decade), his [[Trotskyist]] critics (including his biographer Jan Willem Stutje) argue, with the benefit of hindsight, that he was far too optimistic and hopeful about the possibility of a workers' revolution in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era and after—and more generally, that his historical optimism distorted his political perspectives, so that he became too "certain" about a future that he could not be so certain about, or else crucially [[ambivalence|ambivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Willem Stutje, ''Ernest Mandel: a rebel's dream deferred''. London: Verso, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is arguably a rather shallow criticism insofar as the situation could well have developed in different directions, which is precisely what Mandel himself argued;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, introduction to ''Beyond Perestroika: The Future of Gorbachev's USSR''. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in politics, one could only try to make the most of the situation at the time, and here pessimism was not conducive to action. But the more substantive criticism is that many of Mandel's future scenarios were simply not realistic, and that in reality things turned out rather differently from what he thought. This raises several questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=1 |issue=6 |year=1936 |pages=894–904 [pp. 895–896] |jstor=2084615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*whether the theory of parametric determinism in history is faulty
*whether Mandel's ''application'' of the theory in his analyses was faulty
*how much we can really foresee anyway, and what distinguishes forecast from prophecy.
*whether and how much people learn from history anyway.

In answering these criticisms, Mandel himself would probably have referred to what he often called the "laboratory of history". That is, we can check the historical record, to see who predicted what, the grounds given for the prediction, and the results. On that basis, we can verify empirically what kind of thinking (and what kind of people) will produce the most accurate predictions, and what we can really predict with "usable accuracy". One reason why he favoured [[Marxism]] was because he believed it provided the best intellectual tools for predicting the future of society. He often cited [[Leon Trotsky]] as an example of a good Marxist able to predict the future. Trotsky wrote in 1925 that:

{{Quotation|"The essence of Marxism consists in this, that it approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research, and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record. Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man’s technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature. Precisely this objective approach '''arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight'''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], “Dialectical Materialism and Science” (1925). ''New International'' (New York), Vol.6 No.1, February 1940, pp.24-31.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/09/science.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This may all seem a trivial "academic" or "scholastic" debate, similar to retrospective speculations about "what could have been different", but it has very important implications for the [[socialist]] idea of a [[planned economy]]. Obviously, if it is not possible to predict much about human behaviour with usable accuracy, then not much economic planning is feasible either—since a plan requires at least some expectation that its result ''can and will be realised in the future'', even if the plan is regularly adjusted for new (and unanticipated) circumstances. In general, Mandel believed that the degree of predictability in human life was very much dependent on the way society itself was organised. If e.g. many producers competed with each other for profits and markets, based on privatized knowledge and business secrets, there was much unpredictability in what would happen. If the producers coordinated their efforts co-operatively, much would be predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, "In Defence of Socialist Planning", ''New Left Review'' I/159, September–October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A deeper problem, to which Mandel alludes with his book ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought'', is that ''if'' we regard certain conditions as possible to change for the better, we ''might'' be able to change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible—whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( a similar insight occurs in [[pragmatism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought''. London: NLB, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing. This, however, implies that even when we try our best to be objective and realistic about history or anything else, we remain subjects influenced by ''subjective perceptions'' or elements of [[fear]], [[hope]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or [[faith]] that defy reason or practicality.

It is, simply put, very ''difficult'' to bring scientific truths and political action together, as Marxists aim to do, in such a way that we really change the things we can change for the better to the maximum, and do not try to change things we really cannot change anyway (Marxists call this "the unity of theory and practice"). In other words, the will to change things can involve subjective perceptions of a kind for which even the best historical knowledge may offer no assistance or guide. And all perceptions of "history-making" may inescapably involve [[ideology]], thus—according to skeptics—casting some doubt on the very ability of people to distinguish objectively between what can be changed, and what cannot. The boundary between the two might be rather blurry. This is the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s famous philosophy of social change by "small steps" only.

Mandel's reply to this skepticism essentially was to agree that there were always "unknowns" or "fuzzy" areas in human experience; for people to accomplish anything at all or "make their own history", required taking a [[risk]], calculated or otherwise. One could indeed see one's life as a "wager" ultimately staked on a belief, scientifically grounded or otherwise. However, he argued it was one thing to realise all that, but another to say that the "unknowns" are "unknowable". Thus, for good or for ill, "you don't know, what you haven't tried" and more specifically "you don't know, what you haven't tried to obtain knowledge about". The limits of [[knowledge]] and human possibilities could not be fixed in advance by [[philosophy]]; they had to be ''discovered'' through the test of practice. This attitude recalls [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s famous comment that "All social life is essentially ''practical''. All mysteries which lead theory to [[mysticism]] find their rational solution in human practice, and in the comprehension of this practice.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm|title=Theses On Feuerbach by Karl Marx|first=Karl|last=Marx|date=|work=Marxists.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandel believed, with Marx, that "[[ignorance]] never helped anybody" except those who profited from its existence ("never underestimate human [[gullibility]], including your own").

The general task of revolutionary science was to overcome ignorance about human life, and this could not very well be done by [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciling]] people with their allegedly "predetermined" [[destiny|fate]] at every opportunity. We all know we will die eventually, but that says little yet about what we can achieve before that point. Skepticism has its uses, but what those uses are, can only be verified from experience; a universal skepticism would be just as ''arbitrary'' as the belief that "anything is possible"—it did not lead to any new experience from which something could be learnt, including learning about the possibilities of human [[Freedom of will|freedom]]. And such [[learning]] could only occur through making conscious [[choices]] and [[Decision making|decisions]] within given parameters, i.e. in a ''non-arbitrary'' (non-chaotic) environment, permitting at least some [[predictability]] and allowing definite experiential conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/19xx/marx-hist/index.htm Ernest Mandel, ''The Place of Marxism in history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel often reiterated that most people do not learn all that much from texts or from history, they learn from their own experience. They might be affected by history without knowing it. But anybody concerned with large-scale [[social change]] was almost automatically confronted with the need to place matters in broader historical perspective. One had to understand deeply the limits, consequences and implications of human action. Likewise, politicians making decisions affecting large numbers of people could hardly do without a profound sense of history.

The '''Porter–MacKenzie debate''' refers to a [[historiography|historiographical disagreement]] in the field of [[Historiography of the United Kingdom|Modern British]] and [[Historiography of the British Empire|Imperial history]]. It focuses on the extent to which [[colonialism]] was an important influence within [[British culture]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. The debate was characterised by disagreement between the academic historians [[Bernard Porter]] and [[John M. MacKenzie|John MacKenzie]]. Porter argued that British imperial expansion during the era of [[New Imperialism]] had little effect on ordinary people in the United Kingdom, while MacKenzie argued that colonialism dominated British popular culture for much of the period.

==Debate==
The debate began when Porter's book ''The Absent-Minded Imperialists'' appeared in print in 2004. The book argued that Empire had very little influence on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[popular culture]] in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, arguing that this was the only explanation for the absence during a period of [[New Imperialism|rapid imperial expansion]]. Porter argued that ordinary British people between 1800 and 1940 were largely indifferent to empire:

{{quote|there can be no ''presumption'' that Britain [...] was an essentially 'imperialist' nation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of course she was, in the sense of acquiring and ruling an empire; but that empire [...] might not have been as burdensome as it appeared. Consequently, it did not need to have had deep roots in British society — in its culture, for example — or to have affected it greatly in its turn.{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=24}} }}

''Absent-Minded Imperialists'' argued against the conclusions of previous academic studies which had stressed the extent to which imperialism had shaped European culture, following [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993).{{sfn|The Telegraph|2004}}{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Porter also attacked the conclusions of other works, like MacKenzie's 1984 ''Propaganda and Empire'' which looked at the influence of imperialist propaganda in British culture. Porter was critical of this "MacKenzie school" who argued that the influence of imperialist propaganda "must have been overwhelming if there was so much of it". According to Porter, "an alternative reading, however, might be that it could not have been all that persuasive, if the propagandists felt they needed to propagandize so hard."{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=6}} Additionally, he critiqued the source base of MacKenzie's study, suggesting that MacKenzie had selected his texts arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Absent-Minded Imperialists: Empire, Society and Culture in Britain|last=Porter|first=Bernard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received mixed reviews, with the American historian [[Antoinette Burton]] rejecting it as not "worth arguing either with or about".{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Some academics argued that the book, which was received well in the popular press, would appeal to [[British nationalism|British nationalists]] as absolving them of responsibility for empire; a claim which Porter rejected.{{sfn|Porter|2008|pp=104-5}} In a 2008 article, MacKenzie accused Porter of sidestepping inconvenient evidence by refusing to address it directly, especially when it would affect his argument:{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=662}}

{{quote|In ''Absent-Minded Imperialists'', Porter uses an [[archaeology|archaeological]] metaphor to suggest that all historians have found have been 'shards' of little structural significance. As it happens, I was trained as an archaeologist and very nearly became one. I have found a lot of shards and, to the archaeologist, an assemblage of such shards in their deposits implies the existence of a culture, not its absence.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=665}} }}

Historians who are considered to support the MacKenzie position are [[Catherine Hall]], [[Antoinette Burton]] and [[Jeffrey Richards]]. [[Andrew Thompson (historian)|Andrew Thompson]] notably supported Porter. Thompson argues that there was no one ‘imperial culture’ in the nineteenth century and that empire had a complicated position in British culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Empire Strikes Back?: The Impact of Imperialism on Britain from the Mid-Nineteenth Century|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=Oxon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7955">Since the 18th century, Europeans have been interested in the origins of human migration and the settlement of [[New Zealand]]. Captain James Cook, who arrived in 1769, believed that the [[Māori people|Māori]] were [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] and had come from southeast Asia; however, some other early visitors speculated that they might be descended from ancient Greeks, Romans or Egyptians, and some Christian missionaries thought that the Māori ancestors belonged to the lost tribes of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ideas-of-maori-origins K. R. Howe. p 1 'Ideas of Māori origins'], ''Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', updated 9 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, ideas about [[Aryan]]  migrations became popular and these were applied to New Zealand. [[Edward Robert Tregear|Edward Tregear]]'s ''The Aryan Maori'' (1885) suggested that Aryans from India migrated to the southeast Asia and then to the islands of the Pacific, including New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ideas-of-maori-origins/page-2 K. R. Howe. p 2 'Ideas of Māori origins'], ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', updated 9 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the [[Moriori people]] were thought to be possibly of [[Melanesian]] rather than Polynesian origin, but they are now regarded as descended from early Maori of the Archaic or Moa-hunter period.

Although [[modern archaeology]] has largely clarified questions of the origin and dates of the earliest migrations, some writers have continued to speculate that what is now New Zealand was discovered by 'Celts', Greeks or Egyptians, before the arrival of the Polynesian ancestors of the Māori.

==Maori oral traditions==
Maori oral traditions speak of spirits or fairy folk living in parts of New Zealand when they arrived. They are known by various names, but most commonly as [[Patupaiarehe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/patupaiarehe/page-1 |title=Patupaiarehe-Patupaiarehe and ponaturi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turehu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/first-peoples-in-maori-tradition/page-5 |title=First peoples in Maori tradition-Patupaiarehe, Turehu and other inhabitants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent revivals of pre-Maori settlement theories==
Martin Doutré argued in a 1999 book that New Zealand had a pre-Polynesian [[Celts|Celtic]] population, and that boulders with [[petroglyph]]s on a hill in [[Silverdale, Auckland|Silverdale]] in [[Auckland]] are artifacts left by those people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Doutré|title=Ancient Celtic New Zealand |location=Auckland |publisher=Dé Danann Publishers |year=1999 |isbn=9780473053673}} {{cite news|author=Wayne Thompson |title=Call to save hilltop boulders |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10570580 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier presentation of the theory of pre-Polynesian white settlement of New Zealand was [[Kerry Bolton]]'s 1987 pamphlet ''Lords of the Soil'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kerry R. Bolton |authorlink=Kerry Bolton |title=Lords of the Soil|location=Petone |publisher=Realist Publications |year=1987|oclc=154233606}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that "Polynesia has been occupied by peoples of the [[Caucasian race|Europoid]] race since ancient times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightdemback.org/archive/groups/nzwf/ |title=Kerry Bolton — a nut, or just a misunderstood Mormon/Satanist/Nazi? |author=Barrie Sargeant |date=2 December 2004 |publisher=[[Fightdemback]] |accessdate=13 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414202240/http://www.fightdemback.org/archive/groups/nzwf/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books presenting such theories have included ''The Great Divide: The Story of New Zealand &amp; its Treaty'', (2012) by [[Ian Wishart (journalist)|Ian Wishart]], a journalist, and ''To the Ends of the Earth'' by Maxwell C. Hill, Gary Cook and Noel Hilliam, which claims that New Zealand was discovered by explorers from ancient Egypt and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title= The Great Divide: The Story of New Zealand and its Treaty |location=Auckland |publisher=Howling at the Moon |year=2012 |isbn=9780987657367 }} {{cite book |author=Maxwell C. Hill |title=To the Ends of the Earth |location= Taupiri |publisher=Ancient History Publications |year=2012 |isbn=9780473206871 }} {{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Book-claims-European-explorers-were-here-first/tabid/1160/articleID/247752/Default.aspx |title=Book claims European explorers were here first |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rankin, a [[Ngāpuhi]] elder, has drawn attention to [[Maori legends]] suggesting that people, some of them with fair skin, were already present in the islands when the Maori arrived, and has claimed the existence of a conspiracy among academics to suppress inquiry.&lt;ref name=conspiracy&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10856261 | title = Historians rubbish claims of academic conspiracy | author = Rebecca Quilliam | newspaper = [[The New Zealand Herald]] | date = 27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stoush&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8123896/Stoush-over-pre-Maori-colonisers-theory | title = Stoush over pre-Maori colonisers theory | publisher = [[Stuff.co.nz]], [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax NZ News]] |date = 28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and archaeologists dismiss the theories. [[Michael King]] wrote in his history of New Zealand, "Despite a plethora of amateur theories about [[Melanesian]], South American, Egyptian, [[Phoenicia]]n and Celtic colonisation of New Zealand, there is not a shred of evidence that the first human settlers were anything other than Polynesian",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael King |authorlink=Michael King |title=The Penguin History of New Zealand |year=1994 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-301867-1 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Hill, professor of New Zealand Studies at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], said in 2012, "Not one of [the theories] has ever passed any remote academic scrutiny."&lt;ref name=conspiracy/&gt; Hugh Laracy of the [[University of Auckland]] called them "wild speculation" that has been "thoroughly disposed of by academic specialists".&lt;ref name=stoush/&gt;

Another historian, Vincent O'Malley, and the New Zealand Archaeological Association regard the theories as having a racist or at least a political element, seeking to cast doubt on [[Waitangi Tribunal]] claims.&lt;ref name=conspiracy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alternative Archaeology |url=http://archaeopedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alternative_Archaeology |publisher=New Zealand Archaeological Association|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Hamilton in "No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter" further explains objections to the theories of Bolton and Doutré (and the website ''Ancient Celtic New Zealand'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Hamilton|title=No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter |url=http://books.scoop.co.nz/2008/11/18/no-to-nazi-pseudo-history-an-open-letter/|publisher=Scoop Review of Books |date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rural history''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of historical research which focuses on the history of rural societies. At its inception, the field focused on the [[economic history]] of agriculture. Since the 1980s it has become increasingly influenced by [[social history]]. It can be considered an equivalent of [[urban history]].

A number of [[academic journal]]s and [[learned society|learned societies]] exist to promote rural history.

==History==
Rural history emerged as a distinct discipline from [[History of agriculture|Agricultural history]] in the 1980s and was inspired by the French [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] which favoured integrating economic, social and political history.{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=469}} Initially focused predominantly on the social history of rural life and later became increasingly interested in [[cultural history]].{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=477}}

In [[Europe]], the study of rural history is supported by the European Rural History Organisation (ERHO).

==National studies==

===Britain===
Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on  an "orthodox" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made "impressive progress" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History''. Led by Alun Howkins,&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside since 1900'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?" ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:03 sendia.jpg|thumb|Farmers from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]
{{main|History of agriculture in the United States}}
In the U.S. most rural history has focused on the South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old [[Frontier Thesis|frontier history]] as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History  of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization came in the 20th century, with the arrival of mechanization, the model T, and the agricultural agent—as well as radio.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Craig, ''Out of the Dark: A History of Radio and Rural America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Rural history has been a major specialty of French scholars since the 1920s, thanks especially to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised journals==
A number of [[academic journal]]s exist with a specific focus on rural history. These include:

*''[[Agricultural History (journal)|Agricultural History]]'' (1927–). United States.
*''[[Agricultural History Review]]'' (1953–). United Kingdom.
*''[[Histoire &amp; Sociétés Rurales]]'' (1990–). France.
*''[[Rural History (journal)|Rural History. Economy, Society, Culture.]]'' (1990–). United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Self-referencing doomsday argument rebuttal'''s attempt to refute the [[Doomsday argument]] (that there is a credible link between the brevity of the [[human race]]'s existence and its expected [[human extinction|extinction]]) by applying the same reasoning to the lifetime of the Doomsday [[argument]] (DA) itself.

The first researchers to write about this were P. T. Landsberg and J. N. Dewynne in 1997; they applied belief in the DA to itself, and claimed that a paradox results.

== The paradox ==

If the DA's lifetime is governed by the [[principle of indifference]] and the [[Copernican principle]] then based on the length of its current existence, and assuming that it is randomly drawn from a [[reference class]] of probabilistic speculations it is 95% certain that it will be refuted before the year 2500.

If the DA is not itself subject to these principles then its assumption that the human race's survival-time can be modeled using them appears to be a [[paradox]] (to Lansberg &amp; Dewynne).

Alternatively, if the DA is subject to these presumptions, then as it is expected to expire (be refuted) earlier that its own prediction for the likely survival time of humanity there is a second paradox: The predictions of a theory concerning events to occur after it has been refuted (such as human extinction) are not logically meaningful. Conversely, if the DA survives until the end of human civilization (in the year 5000, say) then it will have dramatically beaten the odds against the expectations of the Copernican principle. This can create a paradox for an argument based on probability, as shown if future [[scenario]]s are broken into three groups:
# [[Human extinction]] occurs before the year 2,500 AD.
# Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD and the DA is never refuted.
# Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD but not before the DA is refuted.

The "quick extinction" in possibility 1 is considered fairly likely in those Doomsday arguments using the number of births as a reference class, but comparing like-for-like we should compare the length of time the DA survives before refutation with the length of ''time'' the human race survives before extinction. Therefore, [[J. Richard Gott]]'s (temporal) DA is used to calculate the probabilities of the three scenarios above:

# According to Gott's DA it is extremely unlikely that the human race will become extinct before the year 2,500 AD, as this would make us extremely special observers; applying the indifference principle to the duration of the human race makes the odds around 400:1 against ('''0.25%''' chance).
# If the Copernican principle applies to the lifetime of theories as well as species (depending on the reference class evidence says it does) then the chance of the (relatively young) DA surviving sustained critical analysis for the next 500 years = 22/500 = '''4.4%'''
# By eliminating the other two outcomes we are left with the third, that the human race will survive to see the Doomsday argument refuted. The chance of this = 100 - (4.4 + 0.25) =''' 95.35%'''

=== Paradoxical conclusion ===

If the Doomsday Argument can apply to itself it can be simultaneously right (as a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]]) and probably wrong (as a prediction).

Therefore, Landsberg and Dewynne argue that it is more likely that the Doomsday argument is wrong (even if its logic is correct) than that the human race will become extinct in 9,000 years (which the DA calculates at around 95% likely). The interesting paradox is that the ''Doomsday argument is probably wrong even assuming it to be completely right'' (in its 95% estimate).

== Extensions ==

In 2001 Bradley Monton and [[Sherrilyn Roush]] extended this by arguing that Gott's DA ''inevitably'' refutes itself.

== Critique ==

This "meta"-DA application of the concept to the DA itself, requires some assumptions that are not universally accepted:
# The hypothesis that the same reasoning can be applied to the lifetime of mathematical theories as can be applied to the survival time of a [[species]]. One difference is that evidence exists for the average "lifetime" of a scientific (falsifiable) prediction; there are libraries full of refuted, unrefuted, and forgotten papers published on mathematics. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
# The [[truth-value]] of the DA and the survival of the human race are un-[[correlated]] in the simple calculation above.
# The concept that the DA is susceptible to refutation; if the DA is not [[falsifiable]] then there is no mechanism for refuting it, even if it is false. This would make it incomparable to [[Wikt:mortal|mortal]] survival. (Landsberg &amp; Dewynne say that the DA is a [[physics|physical theory]] rather than a mathematical hypothesis, and that any such theory is inherently falsifiable, as "experience has shown that any theory in physics, however successful, is only an approximation to reality and will eventually be refuted and require modification." {{ref|Falsifiable}})

(A deterministic approach to a probabilistic argument is [[probability|probably]] inappropriate though.)

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.

'''''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective''''' is a limited-edition [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by &amp;Now Books in 2016.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective'' masquerades as a catalogue for a real retrospective of experimental films by a non-existent videographer. Author [[Lance Olsen]] and his wife, videographer Andi Olsen, stage the fake retrospective in galleries in Europe and the U.S. The result is a three-dimensional text: a real place dedicated to an unreal career of an artist named Alana Olsen. From her videos and the texts surrounding them (including this catalogue/novel), the viewer/reader is invited to treat her like a fictional character, inferring her character, development, obsessions, and relationship with her daughter, Aila, who allegedly curates the exhibit, but is in fact another fictive character. The catalogue/novel is made up of critical and biographical essays, stills, and reminiscences about Alana's small body of work (fewer than 20 videos over five decades, some of which have  gone missing) produced in relative anonymity, yet apparently a large influence on artists as varied as [[Lars von Trier]], [[Douglas Gordon]], and [[Martin Arnold]].

Thematically, ''There's No Place Like Time,'' then, forms part of a larger [[conceptual art]] installation that investigates the difficulties inherent in identity and knowledge about the past.

'''''Translatio imperii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of rule") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]], in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an ''[[imperium]]'' that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an "[[emperor]]" (or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Western [[Holy Roman Empire]]). The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio studii]]'' (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[Jacques Le Goff]]&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;Le Goff, Jacques. ''La civilisation de l'Occident médieval''. Paris. 1964; English translation (1988): ''Medieval Civilization'', {{ISBN|0-631-17566-0}} &amp;ndash; "translatio imperii" is discussed in Part II, Chapter VI, section on "Time, eternity and history".&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ''translatio imperii'' concept as "typical" for the Middle Ages for several reasons:
* the idea of linearity of time and history was typical for the Middle Ages;
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea typically also neglected simultaneous developments in other parts of the world (of no importance to medieval Europeans);
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea didn't separate "divine" history from the history of "worldly power": medieval Europeans considered divine (supernatural) and material things as part of the same continuum, which was their reality. Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

Each medieval author described the ''translatio imperii'' as a succession leaving the supreme power in the hands of the monarch ruling the region of the author's provenance:
* [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]] (French area, 10th century): Roman Empire → [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Franks]] → '''[[Saxons]]'''&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto of Freising]] (living in German region): [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] → [[Byzantium]] → [[Franks]] → [[Longobards]] → '''[[Germany|Germans]]''' (=[[Holy Roman Empire]]);
* [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (living in medieval France): [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] → Rome → '''[[Medieval France|France]]'''&lt;ref&gt;De Troyes, Chrétien. ''[[Cligès]]''. Circa 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard de Bury]] (England, 14th century): "Athens" (Greece) → Rome → "Paris" (France) → '''[[England]]'''

Later, continued and reinterpreted by modern and contemporary movements and authors (some known examples):
* [[Fifth Monarchists]] (England, 17th century): [[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → [[Persian Empire|Persians]] → [[Macedonian Empire]] → Rome → '''England''' (and the '''[[British Empire]]''' later)
* [[António Vieira]] (Portugal, 17th century): [[Assyrian Empire|Assyro]]-[[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → Persians → Greeks → Romans → '''[[Portuguese Empire]]'''
* [[Fernando Pessoa]] (Portugal, 20th century): Greece → Rome → [[Christianity]] → [[Europe]] → '''[[Portugal]]'''

Medieval and Renaissance authors often linked this transfer of power by genealogically attaching a ruling family to an ancient Greek or Trojan hero; this schema was modeled on [[Virgil]]'s use of [[Aeneas]] (a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero) as progenitor of the city of [[Rome]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.  Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'') and [[Wace]] (in his ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'') linked the founding of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]] to the arrival of [[Brutus of Troy]], son of Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Bratu, Cristian. "Translatio, autorité et affirmation de soi chez Gaimar, Wace et Benoît de Sainte-Maure." The Medieval Chronicle 8 (2013): 135-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, the French Renaissance author [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] (in his ''Les Illustrations de Gaule et Singularités de Troie'') linked the founding of Celtic [[Gaul]] to the arrival of the Trojan [[Francus]] (i.e. [[Astyanax]]), the son of [[Hector]]; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of [[Priam]]; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] and [[Charlemagne]] (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for [[Ronsard]]'s epic poem, "La Franciade").

== From the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire ==
The cardinal point in the idea of the ''Translatio imperii'' is the link between the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire.
*[[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine I]] established [[Constantinople]], a [[New Rome]], as a second capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.
*After the death of [[Theodosius I|Emperor Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire is permanently divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire).
*With the demise of the Western Empire in 476, the Byzantine Empire remained as the sole Roman Empire.
*Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] married his son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] to [[Irene of Athens]] on 17 December 768, brought to [[Constantinople]] by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, [[Constantine VI|Constantine]]. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became [[regent]] for their nine-year-old son, [[Constantine VI]].
*As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of Frankish king Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. 
*As [[Constantine VI]] approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797 Irene deposed her son, who died soon afterwards.
*Some western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and many of the cities of the Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial name. [[Pope Leo III]], crowned Charlemagne as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire.
*Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], who alone mentions it, the scheme was frustrated by [[Aetios (eunuch)|Aetios]], one of her favourites.&lt;ref&gt;See Garland, p. 89, who explains that Aetios was attempting to usurp power on behalf of his brother Leo.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by [[Nikephoros I]]. She was exiled and died the following year.
* ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'',  a [[peace treaty]] in 803 between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] and [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]], [[Basileus]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].
* Recognition of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Emperor]] ([[Basileus]]) in 812 by Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]), after he reopened negotiations with the [[Franks]]. In exchange for that recognition, [[Venice]] was returned to the Byzantine Empire.
* On February 2, 962, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was solemnly crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope John XII]]. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto's desire, founded the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the [[pallium]] on the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[Archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[Bishop of Verona]]. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the famous ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the [[Donation of Pepin]].

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:
