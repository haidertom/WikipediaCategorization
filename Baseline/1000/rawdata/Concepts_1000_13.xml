'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H.

H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30561">'''Bateman's principle''', in [[evolutionary biology]], is that in most species, variability in [[reproductive success]] (or reproductive variance) is greater in males than in females. It was first proposed by [[Angus John Bateman]] (1919–1996), an English geneticist. Bateman suggested that, since males are capable of producing millions of sperm cells with little effort, while females invest much higher levels of energy in order to nurture a relatively small number of eggs, the female plays a significantly larger role in their offspring's reproductive success. Bateman’s paradigm thus views females as the limiting factor of parental investment, over which males will compete in order to [[copulate]] successfully.

Although Bateman's principle served as a cornerstone for the study of [[sexual selection]] for many decades, it has recently been subject to criticism. Attempts to reproduce Bateman's experiments in 2012 and 2013 were unable to support his conclusions. Some scientists have criticized Bateman's experimental and statistical methods, or pointed out conflicting evidence, while others have defended the veracity of the principle and cited evidence in support of it.

== Description ==
Typically it is the [[female]]s who have a relatively larger investment in producing each offspring. Bateman attributed the origin of the unequal investment to the differences in the production of gametes: sperm are cheaper than eggs. A single [[male]] can easily fertilize all females' eggs; she will not produce more offspring by mating with more than one male.  A male is capable of fathering more offspring if he mates with several females.  By and large, a male's potential reproductive success is limited by the number of females he mates with, whereas a female's potential reproductive success is limited by how many eggs she can produce. According to Bateman's principle, this results in [[sexual selection]], in which males compete with each other, and females become choosy in which males to mate with. Thus, as a result of being [[anisogamy|anisogamous]], males are fundamentally promiscuous, and females are fundamentally selective.

== History ==
Bateman initially published his review in 1948. He was a botanist, contributing to the literature of sexual selection only once in his lifetime. Bateman initially saw his study on Drosophila to be a test of Charles Darwin’s doctrine of sexual selection. He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt that if he were to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection played a role in the reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.

Although it is common to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his principle can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.

== Bateman's study ==
Throughout his research, Bateman conducted experiments using fruit flies in order to observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'', using three to five individuals of each sex. Each trial ran for three or four days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (bottle) to another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates based on the number of offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.

Analysis of the data collected in sets one through four showed that the males' reproductive success, estimated as the number of sired offspring, increased at a steady rate until a total of three mates were reached. It is important to note that Bateman kept the sex ratio of males to females completely even throughout his trials. But after surpassing three mates, male reproductive success began to fall. Female reproductive success also increased with number of mates, but much more gradually than that of the males. The second series of data collected in sets five and six illustrated a dramatically different outcome. Male reproductive success increased at a steady and steep rate, never dropping. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, plateaued after a single mate. Bateman focused mainly on the second series of data when discussing his results. His main conclusion was that the reproductive success of females does not increase with an influx of mates, as one fit mate was enough to successfully complete fertilization. This is often referred to as Bateman’s Gradient.

== Replication of Bateman's experiments ==
Throughout 2012 and 2013, Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson took it upon themselves to repeat Bateman's experiment in its entirety. While reproducing his tests, the same fly strains and mutations were used in order to maintain the same methodology. However, one of the 11 strains that Bateman used had gone extinct, and was thus replaced. (Tang-Martinez 2012)

Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson found that upon combining certain strains with one another, the offspring were unable to survive to adulthood. (Gowaty, Kim, &amp; Anderson 2012) Thus, Bateman’s numbers regarding the number of individuals not having mated was higher than the actual number. Likewise, his estimate of those that mated with one or more mates was too low. This was valid for both the males and females of this species.

Gowaty desired to further explore the reasoning behind the premature death of the Drosophila. She began doing so by running monogamy trials between different strains of flies and found that 25% of the offspring died due to becoming double mutants. (Gowaty 2013) Bateman thought his work fit within the lines of Mendel’s laws of genetics, while Gowaty proved otherwise. The 1948 experiments inferred reproductive success based on the number of adults living by the end of the trial. In reality, many factors were left out of the equation when calculating reproductive success as a function of the number of mates, which had the ability to completely dislodge the accuracy behind Bateman's results. Gowaty was not able to confirm Bateman's conclusions and found no evidence for sexual selection in the experiment. (Gowaty 2013; Tang-Martinez 2012)&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;

== Related experiments ==
Nevertheless, some modern experiments between the relationship of number of mates and the reproductive success of males and females support Bateman's principle. Julie Collet conducted an experiment with a population of red jungle fowl. A total of thirteen replicate groups of three males and four females were monitored for ten days. In this experiment, the sex ratio was biased toward females. A male's reproductive success was calculated using the proportion of embryos fathered to the total number of embryos produced by all the females he mated with. The total sexual selection opportunity was calculated using the following formula.

The ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents the variance in RS, while the{{clarify|date=December 2016}} is the square mean of reproductive success of members of one sex in a group.

In 2013, Fritzsche and Arnqvist tested Bateman's principle by estimating sexual selection between males and females in four seed beetles. They used a unique experimental design that showed sexual selection to be greater in males than in females. In contrast, sexual selection was also shown to be stronger for females in role-reversed species. They suggested that the Bateman gradient is typically the most accurate and informative measure of sexual selection between different sexes and species (Fritzsche, K. &amp; Arnqvist, G).{{full|date=June 2018}}

== Modern criticism ==
More than 60 years later, Bateman's principle has received considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success may result from random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies are subject to change depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Newcomer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Scott D.|last2=Zeh|first2=Jeanne A.|last3=Zeh|first3=David W.|date=1999-08-31|title=Genetic benefits enhance the reproductive success of polyandrous females|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10236|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=96|issue=18|pages=10236–10241|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.18.10236|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10468592|pmc=17872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental and statistical criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model focused on his experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental and statistical calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, ''Drosophila melanogaster'', may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty conducted the first in-depth analysis of the data in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found sampling biases, mathematical errors, and selective presentation of data.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=Brian F. |last2=Gowaty |first2=Patricia Adair |title=A Reappraisal of Bateman's Classic Study of Intrasexual Selection |journal=Evolution |date=November 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2457–2468 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00212.x|pmid=17725639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by [[Zuleyma Tang-Martinez|Zuleyma Tang-Martínez]] concluded that various empirical and theoretical studies, especially Gowaty's reproduction of Bateman's original experiment, pose a major challenge to Bateman's conclusions, and that Bateman's principle should be considered an unproven hypothesis in need of further reexamination.&lt;ref name="Tang-Martinez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang-Martinez|first1=Zuleyma|title=Repetition of Bateman challenges the paradigm|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=6 July 2012|volume=109|issue=29|pages=11476–11477|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209394109|pmid=22773808|pmc=3406825}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tang-Martínez, "modern data simply don't support most of Bateman's and [[Robert Trivers|Trivers']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s predictions and assumptions."&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tang-Martinez |first1=Zuleyma |title=Data Should Smash the Biological Myth of Promiscuous Males and Sexually Coy Females |url=http://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 review confirmed Darwinian sex roles across the animal kingdom, concluding that "sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500983|title=Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom|first1=Tim|last1=Janicke|first2=Ines K.|last2=Häderer|first3=Marc J.|last3=Lajeunesse|first4=Nils|last4=Anthes|date=1 February 2016|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1500983|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=advances.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500983|pmid=26933680|pmc=4758741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One error source that have been shown to give an illusion of greater differential in reproductive success in males than in females genetically is that chromosome effects cause a greater percentage of mutations to be lethal before even reaching sexual maturity in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gowaty | first=P. A. | last2=Kim | first2=Y.-K. | last3=Anderson | first3=W. W. | title=No evidence of sexual selection in a repetition of Bateman's classic study of Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=109 | issue=29 | date=11 June 2012 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1207851109 | pmid=22689966 | pmc=3406809 | pages=11740–11745 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/06/1207851109.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that any differential in reproductive success between males and females among the individuals that do reach sexual maturity must be due to sexual selection in the current population is also subject to criticism, such as the possibility of remnants of sexually selected traits in a previous species from which a new species have evolved can be negatively selected due to costs in nutrients and weakened immune systems and that such negative selection would cause a higher difference in reproductive success in males than in females even without any still ongoing sexual selection. Since lower degrees of selection during times of stable environment allows genetic variation to build up by random mutations and allow some individuals in a population to survive environmental change while strong constant selection offsets the effect and increases the risk of the entire population dying out during catastrophic environmental change due to less genetic variation, constant loss of genetic variation caused by sexual selection have been suggested as a factor contributing to higher [[extinction]] rates in more sexually dimorphic species besides the nutrient, immunity and other costs of the ornaments themselves. While the ornament cost risk would only be removed when the ornaments have been eliminated by selection, the genetic variation model predicts that the species ability to survive would improve significantly even at an early stage of reduction of sexual dimorphism due to other adaptive mutations arising and surviving due to minimal selection during times of stable environment while the genes causing sexually dimorphic anatomy have only in small part been affected by the mutations. Applied to human evolution, this model can explain why early [[Homo sapiens]] display a significantly increased adaptability to environmental change already at its early divergence from [[Homo erectus]] that had a high muscular sexual dimorphism, as well as why human anatomy through the history of Homo sapiens show a diversification during times of stable climate and a selective loss of the more robust male forms during environmental change that does not recover during later stability, continuing through the loss of many robust characteristics in regional bottlenecks as recent as the end of the Ice Age and the time around the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]. It also explains genetic evidence of human genetic diversity increasing during stable environmental periods and being reduced during bottlenecks related to changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthes | first=Nils | last2=Häderer | first2=Ines K. | last3=Michiels | first3=Nico K. | last4=Janicke | first4=Tim | editor-last=Schielzeth | editor-first=Holger | title=Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines | journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution | volume=8 | issue=8 | date=20 December 2016 | issn=2041-210X | doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12707 | pages=918–931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zuk | first=Marlene | last2=Garcia-Gonzalez | first2=Francisco | last3=Herberstein | first3=Marie Elisabeth | last4=Simmons | first4=Leigh W. | title=Model Systems, Taxonomic Bias, and Sexual Selection: Beyond Drosophila | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=59 | issue=1 | date=7 January 2014 | issn=0066-4170 | doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-011613-162014 | pmid=24160422 | pages=321–338 | hdl=10261/90632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
Recently, DNA testing has permitted more detailed investigation of mating behavior in numerous species. The results, in many cases, have been cited as evidence against Bateman's principle.&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tang-Martínez | first=Zuleyma | title=Rethinking Bateman's Principles: Challenging Persistent Myths of Sexually Reluctant Females and Promiscuous Males | journal=The Journal of Sex Research | volume=53 | issue=4–5 | date=13 April 2016 | issn=0022-4499 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1150938 | pmid=27074147 | pages=532–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incompatibility with other sex difference claims ==
There are a number of claims about sex differences in humans said by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] to be well supported that are not logically predicted by Bateman's principle. One example that have been pointed out is [[language]] ability that is said to be more developed in women than in men. It is argued that language, being a [[origin of language|derived human trait]], is not predicted by a model that assumes males to be more selected than females to be present to a higher degree in women than in men but the opposite. The objection about a trade-off between [[spatial ability]] and language is found lacking due to the existence of animals that outperform humans on spatial tasks such as [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[bat]]s while having much smaller and more rapidly maturing brains than humans, while [[great ape language]] is limited and ungrammatical at best despite great apes being much closer to humans in brain capacity than bats or birds of prey are, showing that the system requirements for spatial ability are much lower than those for language and therefore not a serious trade-off for them. The generalization of Bateman's principle to societies lacking modern [[birth control]] is also argued to be incompatible with such generalization of the "nuns more successful at [[celibacy]] than monks" clause of the female [[erotic plasticity]] model, as absence of modern contraceptives would mean that absence of reproduction for many men required that many men had no sexual relationships with women while male sexual exclusivity to a particular gender, if present, would have precluded same-sex relationships as a form of non-celibacy for men who could not find a female mate as well. It is also mentioned that the evolutionary psychologists themselves claim that women are sexually picky due to an evolutionary history without modern contraception, while it is pointed out that the notion of celibacy being impossible for men in general with only a small number of individual exceptions is incompatible with the notion of evolution making celibacy inevitable for a significant percentage of men.&lt;ref&gt;PD Lorch, L Bussière, DT Gwynne (2008) "Quantifying the potential for sexual dimorphism using upper limits on Bateman gradients"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Ah-King, I Ahnesjö - Evolutionary biology (2013) "The “sex role” concept: an overview and evaluation"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-role reversed species ==
The most well-known exceptions to Bateman's principle are the existence of sex-role reversed species such as pipefish ([[seahorse]]s), [[phalarope]]s and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s in which the males perform the majority of the parental care, and are cryptic while the females are highly ornamented and territorially aggressive ({{Harvcolnb|Emlen|Oring|1977}}; {{Harvcolnb|Knowlton|1982}}; {{Harvcolnb|Berglund|Widemo|Rosenqvist|2005}}). 

In these species, however, the typical fundamental sex differences are reversed: females have a faster reproductive rate than males (and thus greater reproductive variance), and males have greater assurance of genetic parentage than do females {{Harv|Flinn|2004}}. Consequently, reversals in sex roles and reproductive variance are consistent with Bateman's principle, and with Robert Trivers's [[parental investment]] theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">{{Immanuel Kant}}

In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy, a '''category''' ({{lang-de|Categorie}} in the [[Critique of Pure Reason|original]] or ''Kategorie'' in [[modern German]]) is a pure concept of the [[#The table of judgments|understanding]] (''Verstand''). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced. Kant wrote that "They are concepts of an object in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B129, (''Sie sind Begriffe von einem Gegenstande überhaupt'')&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also wrote that, "…pure cоncepts [Categories] of the undеrstanding which apply to objects of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 79 (''reine Verstandesbegriffe, welche a priori auf Gegenstände der Anschauung überhaupt gehen'')&lt;/ref&gt; Such a category is not a classificatory division, as the word is commonly used. It is, instead, the condition of the [[Epistemic possibility|possibility]] of objects in general,&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 139&lt;/ref&gt; that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular.

== Meaning of "category" ==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:κατηγορία|κατηγορία]], ''katēgoria'', meaning "that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something." A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. "…I remark concerning the categories…that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], June 20, 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Kant called them "ontological predicates."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt;

A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. [[J.S. Mill|John Stuart Mill]] wrote: "The Categories, or Predicaments &amp;mdash; the former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin language &amp;mdash; were believed to be an enumeration  of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the ''summa genera'' (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''[[A System of Logic]]'', I, 3, §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because " … as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him..."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of the Categories as predicates at one time.  For example, a general object cannot have the qualitative Categories of reality and negation at the same time. Similarly, an object in general cannot have both unity and plurality as quantitative predicates at once. The Categories of Modality exclude each other. Therefore, a general object cannot simultaneously have the Categories of possibility/impossibility and existence/non&amp;ndash;existence as qualities.

Since the Categories are a list of that which can be said of every object, they are related only to human language. In making a verbal statement about an object, a speaker makes a judgment. A general object, that is, every object, has attributes that are contained in Kant's list of Categories. In a judgment, or verbal statement, the Categories are the predicates that can be asserted of every object and all objects.

==The table of judgments&lt;!--'Understanding (Kant)' redirects here--&gt;==
Kant believed that the ability of the human '''understanding'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (German: ''Verstand'', Greek: ''[[dianoia]]'' "διάνοια", Latin: ''[[ratio]]'') to think about and know an object is the same as the making of a spoken or written judgment about an object. According to him, "Our ability to judge is equivalent to our ability to think."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A judgment is the thought that a thing is known to have a certain quality or attribute. For example, the sentence "The rose is red" is a judgment. Kant created a table of the forms of such judgments as they relate to all objects in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

This table of judgments was used by Kant as a model for the table of categories. Taken together, these twelvefold tables constitute the formal structure for Kant's [[Kantian architectonics|architectonic]] conception of his philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp.266-288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 ''Kant's System of Perspectives'']: ''An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemata==
Categories are entirely different from the appearances of objects. According to Kant, in order to relate to specific phenomena, categories must be "applied" through [[time]]. The way that this is done is called a [[Schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Criticism==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], in his [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]], found many errors{{Examples|date=September 2018}} in Kant's use of the Categories of Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Modality. Schopenhauer also noted that in accordance with Kant's claim, non-human animals would not be able to know objects. Animals would only know impressions on their [[sense organ]]s, which Kant mistakenly{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} calls [[perception]].

They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Redirect|Succinct}}
'''Concision''' (alternatively '''brevity''', '''laconicism''', '''terseness''', or '''conciseness''') is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] without omitting important information. Concision has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing.&lt;ref name="tEoS"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related concept of '''succinctness''' is the opposite of [[verbosity]].

==Description==
Concision means to be economical with words, expressing what's needed using the fewest words necessary.&lt;ref name="Concision"&gt;"What is Concision?" Accessed February 4, 2017. [https://concision.co.uk/concision/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; That may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with shorter ones. It is described in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]] as follows:&lt;ref name="tEoS"/&gt;

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.|Elementary Principles of Composition, ''The Elements of Style''}}

Concision has also been described as "eliminat[ing] words that take up space without saying much."&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;Program for Writing and Rhetoric, University of Colorado at Boulder. "Writing Tip #27: Revising for Concision and Clarity." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.colorado.edu/pwr/writingtips/27.html Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples include replacing "{{sic|due to the fact that}}" with "because" or "at this point in time" with "now" or "currently."&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;UNT Writing Lab. "Concision, Clarity, and Cohesion." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.unt.edu/writinglab/UNTOWL_Concision_Clarity_and_Cohesion.pdf Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence, with explanation:&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;

{{quote|'''"It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, that is the audience, that the arguments are true."''' Notice the beginning of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a fact, just present it. So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce '''"Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers,"''' or a similarly straightforward expression.}}

==Example paragraph==
The following example is taken from:&lt;ref name="UNT"/&gt;

{{quote|The author of the poem illustrated various differences between the characters. The poem, which was a [[romantic poem]], showed that each individual character was sort of devious in the way in which he or she did things and behaved. The two characters in the poem, who were named Jim and Dwight, were never definitely and completely honest with each other, which led to the final outcome of them being unhappy. This outcome, which was undesirable, is designed in a way to show the readers just exactly how the author feels about lying and deceit.}}

The source suggests this replacement:

{{quote|The romantic poem showed that its characters were devious. Jim and Dwight, the poem’s two characters, were never honest with each other and ended up unhappy. This undesirable outcome shows the readers how the author feels about lying.}}

In the second quote, the same information is communicated in less than half the length. However, it could be more concisely rewritten and communicate the same information:

{{quote|The romantic poem’s characters, Jim and Dwight, were dishonest with each other and ended up unhappy, showing the author's feelings about lying.}}

==Teaching concise expression==
Concise expression, particularly in writing, is considered one of the basic goals of teaching the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Buczynski, Kristin Fontichiaro, ''Story Starters and Science Notebooking: Developing Student Thinking Through Literacy and Inquiry'' (2009), p. 7, {{ISBN|1591586860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques to achieve concise writing are taught for students at all levels, from the introduction to writing to the preparation of PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, ''Authoring a PhD: How to Plan, Draft, Write and Finish a Doctoral Thesis or Dissertation'' (2003), p. 273, {{ISBN|023036800X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal writing for law students.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Writing Institute, ''Legal Writing: The Journal of the Legal Writing Institute'' (2002), Vol. 7, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that although "in expository prose English places a high value on conciseness... [t]he value placed on conciseness... is not shared by all cultures", with, for example, the [[Thai culture]] as one where redundancy is prized as an opportunity to use additional words to demonstrate the writer's command of the language.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"&gt;Mark Newell Brock, Larry Walters, ''Teaching Composition Around the Pacific Rim: Politics and Pedagogy'' (1992), p. 4-5, {{ISBN|1853591602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to a tendency for people from those cultures to use repetitive or redundant phrasing when learning English.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"/&gt;

==Succinctness==
The related concept of '''succinctness''' is a characteristic of [[Plain language|speech]],&lt;ref name=Garner2009b&gt;{{cite book | last1=Garner| first1=Bryan A.| author1-link=Bryan A.

It is the opposite of verbosity, in which there is an excess of words.

Brevity in succinctness is not achieved by shortening original material by [[code|coding]] or [[Data compression|compressing]] it, but rather by omitting [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]] material from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the phenomenon ''E'' as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertia is the state of a body experiencing no acceleration, whether by change in speed—either quickening or slowing—or by change in direction, and thus exhibits constant [[velocity]], which is speed plus direction.&lt;/ref&gt; which, by omitting aether,&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=ether pp 29–30].&lt;/ref&gt; converted space and time into ''relative'' phenomena whose relativity aligned [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]] with the Newtonian principle [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity or invariance]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To explain absolute light speed without aether, Einstein modeled that a body at motion in an electromagnetic field experiences [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], which [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had already modeled as [[Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction]] and [[Lorentz transformation]] but by hypothesizing [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] states of the aether, whereas Einstein's special relativity was simply [[kinematics|kinematic]], that is, positing no causal mechanical explanation, simply describing positions, thus showing how to align measuring devices, namely, clocks and rods.

In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently formalized [[quantum mechanics]] (QM).&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq= pp 113–18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite clashing explanations,&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=QMs&gt;Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] posed an [[electron]]'s charge smeared across space as a [[wavefunction|waveform]], later reinterpreted as the electron [[probability amplitude|manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely]] while eventually building up that deterministic waveform.  Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.  Again, we have an example of a false but empirically successful theory".&lt;/ref&gt; "relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since" 1905 brought [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;Pigliucci, ''Answers for Aristotle'' (Basic Books, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=laZensALMSgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=antirealist+aether p 119]: "But the antirealist will quickly point out that plenty of times in the past scientists have posited the existence of unobservables that were apparently necessary to explain a phenomenon, only to discover later on that such unobservables did not in fact exist.  A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.  The antirealists will relish pointing out that modern physics features a number of similarly unobservable entities, from [[quantum foam|quantum mechanical 'foam']] to [[dark energy]], and that the current crop of scientists seems just as confident about the latter two as their nineteenth-century counterparts were about aether".&lt;/ref&gt;  Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence,&lt;ref name=Tavel/&gt; simply said it superfluous.&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30/&gt;  Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p78-80&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt; and to explain motion was led back to aether in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Laughlin&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'' (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=ironic pp 120–21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorentz aether theory|Lorentz aether]] was at absolute rest—acting ''on'' matter but not acted on ''by'' matter.  Replacing it and resembling [[Ernst Mach]]'s aether, Einstein aether is [[spacetime]] itself—which is the [[gravitational field]]—receiving motion from a body and transmitting it to other bodies while propagating at light speed, [[gravitational waves|waving]].  An unobservable, however, Einstein aether is not a privileged [[frame of reference|reference frame]]—is not to be assigned a state of absolute motion or absolute rest.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet resistance to [[relativity theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Relativity theory comprises both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR).  Holding for inertial reference frames, SR is as a limited case of GR, which holds for all reference frames, both inertial and accelerated.  In GR, all motion—inertial, accelerated, or gravitational—is consequent of the geometry of 3D space stretched onto the 1D axis of time.  By GR, no force distinguishes acceleration from inertia.  Inertial motion is consequence simply of ''uniform'' geometry of spacetime, acceleration is consequence simply of ''nonuniform'' geometry of spacetime, and gravitation is simply acceleration.&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote/&gt;  Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether,&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 14–18].&lt;/ref&gt; but Einstein aether, too, was opposed.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Objects became conceived as pinned directly on [[spacetime|space and time]]&lt;ref&gt;In Einstein's 4D spacetime, 3D space is stretched onto the 1D axis of time flow, which [[time dilation|slows]] while space additionally [[space contraction|contracts]] in the vicinity of mass or energy.&lt;/ref&gt; by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-p180&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, QED along with [[weak force|weak nuclear field]] was reduced to [[electroweak theory]] (EWT), and the [[strong force|strong nuclear field]] was modeled as [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Comprised by EWT, QCD, and [[Higgs field]], this [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is an "effective theory",&lt;ref&gt;As an effective field theory, once adjusted to particular domains, Standard Model is predictively accurate until a certain, vast energy scale that is a cutoff, whereupon more fundamental phenomena—regulating the effective theory's modeled phenomena—would emerge. (Burgess &amp; Moore, ''Standard Model'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLYECqs2geEC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=effective p xi]; Wells, ''Effective Theories'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKKAfrfCofcC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Natural+Standard+Model pp 55–56]).&lt;/ref&gt; not truly fundamental.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner&gt;Jegerlehner, "The Standard Model as a low-energy effective theory", [https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7813 arXiv:1304.7813]: "We understand the [[Standard Model|SM]] as a low energy effective emergence of some unknown physical system—we may call it 'ether'—which is located at the [[Planck scale]] with the [[Planck length]] as a 'microscopic' length scale.  Note that the cutoff, though very large, in any case is finite".&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[gluons|QCD's particles]] are considered nonexistent in the everyday world,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; QCD especially suggests an aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73/&gt; routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'', (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq= pp 120–21]: "The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity.  This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  ...  Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry.  It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.  The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.  But we do not call it this because it is taboo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirmation of the [[Higgs particle]], modeled as a condensation within the [[Higgs field]], corroborates aether,&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt; although physics need not state or even include aether.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Organizing regularities of ''observations''—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover ''aether''.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem/&gt;

In 1905, from [[special relativity]], Einstein deduced [[mass–energy equivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;Mass–energy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; particles being variant forms of distributed energy,&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA616&amp;dq=special p 13]: "[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy".&lt;/ref&gt; how [[particle accelerator|particles colliding at vast speed]] experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,&lt;ref&gt;Braibant, Giacomelli &amp; Spurio, ''Particles and Fundamental Interactions'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YUUG2pGeIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=electron+proton+neutron+collisions p 2]: "Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass".&lt;/ref&gt; although physicists' talk promotes confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]] explained, "People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it.  The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside.  Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy.  Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding [[proton]]s.  The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being" [Avent, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&amp;A"], ''Economist'', 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  As "the contemporary locus of [[metaphysical]] research", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as ''excitation modes'' of fields,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P396&amp;dq= p 396].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt; the particles and their masses being states of aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13&gt;Wilczek, [http://ctpweb.lns.mit.edu/physics_today/phystoday/Ether.pdf "The persistence of ether"], ''Phys Today'', 1999; '''52''':11,13, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,&lt;ref name=Riesselmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 "The grid (persistence of ether)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ether+QCD p 73]: "For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.  Other developments in modern physics reinforce and enrich that lesson.  Later, as we explore the current frontiers, we'll see how the concept of 'empty' space as a rich, dynamic medium empowers our best thinking about how to achieve the unification of forces".&lt;/ref&gt; as long ago foreseen.&lt;ref name=Lodge/&gt;  Yet a ''quantum'' field is an intricate abstraction—a ''mathematical'' field—virtually inconceivable as a ''classical'' field's physical properties.&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate"], ''Sci Am'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''' or the '''global cognitive workspace model''' is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s "[[Global Workspace Theory|global workspace model]]" for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]]. It attempts to reproduce the [[swarm behaviour]] {{clarify|date=November 2011}} of the [[brain]]'s ''higher cognitive functions'' such as [[consciousness]], [[decision-making]]&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Reward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making.''' Prog Brain Res. 2000;126:217-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central [[executive functions]]. It was developed by cognitive neuroscientists [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] beginning in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing.''' Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of [[inattentional blindness]] and the solving of the [[Tower of London test]].&lt;ref&gt;Changeux JP, Dehaene S. '''Hierarchical neuronal modeling of cognitive functions: from synaptic transmission to the Tower of London.''' Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série III. 1998 Feb–Mar;321(2–3):241-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Nadal JP. '''Neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2727-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]&lt;ref&gt;Epub 2010 Jan 25. Van den Bussche E, Hughes G, Humbeeck NV, Reynvoet B '''The relation between consciousness and attention: an empirical study using the priming paradigm.''' Conscious Cogn. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97..&lt;/ref&gt; and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen &amp; Hudson (2002) had already used "''Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis ''"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.E.;  Hudson, D.L.;  Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on 233 – 238&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Cohen &amp; Hudson, Dehaene &amp; Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "''hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent''", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. It may also be noted that Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Jain, Zhengxin Chen, Nikhil Ichalkaranje Intelligent agents and their applications Volume 98 de Studies in fuzziness and soft computing&lt;/ref&gt; since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maas, W. Lower Bound for the computational power of networks of spking neurons [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.933]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''DCM''' being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[Multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[Swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

[[File:Dehaene &amp; Changeux 2005 PLOS (ccreative commons).png|thumb|900px|center|The three levels of [[complexity]] of the global workspace model: the [[Integrate and fire#Integrate-and-fire|integrate-and-fire]] neuron, the thalamo-cortical bundle and the long-range connexion. The authors provide the legend: "Shown are the constituents of the simulation (upper diagrams) and typical patterns of spontaneous activity that they can produce (lower tracings). We simulated a nested architecture in which spiking neurons (A) are incorporated within thalamocortical columns (B), which are themselves interconnected hierarchically by local and long-distance cortical connections (C) (see ''Materials and methods'' for details). While single neurons may generate sustained oscillations of [[membrane potential]]s (A), only the column and network levels generate complex waxing-and-waning [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]-like oscillations (B) and [[metastable]] global states of sustained firing (C)."&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux J-P (2005) '''Ongoing Spontaneous Activity Controls Access to Consciousness: A Neuronal Model for Inattentional Blindness.''' PLoS Biol 3(5): e141. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0030141}} image in full open source&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Behavior==
The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C. '''Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy.''' Trends Cogn Sci. 2006 May;10(5):204-11. Epub 2006 Apr 17.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene-Changeux Model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. '''Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization.''' PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. '''Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks.''' J Neurosci. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene-Changeux Global Neuronal Workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf Werner G. '''Brain dynamics across levels of organization.''' J Physiol Paris. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, building from the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "''the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692735/pdf/10724457.pdf | pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 | title=The labile brain. I. Neuronal transients and nonlinear coupling | year=2000 | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | pages=215–36 | last1 = Friston | first1 = KJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/vs/murphy_propofol.pdf Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.Propofol '''anesthesia and sleep: a high-density EEG study.''' Sleep. 2011 Mar 1;34(3):283-91A.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014224 Stamatakis EA, Adapa RM, Absalom AR, Menon DK. '''Changes in resting neural connectivity during propofol sedation.''' PLoS One. 2010 Dec 2;5(12):e14224.] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dehaene-Changeux Model was contrasted and cited in the study of [[collective consciousness]] and its pathologies (Wallace et al. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/10 Wallace RM, Fullilove MT, Fullilove RE, Wallace DN. '''Collective consciousness and its pathologies: understanding the failure of AIDS control and treatment in the United States.''' Theor Biol Med Model. 2007 Feb 26;4:10. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2007) used the model for a reverse somatotopic study, demonstrating a correlation between baseline brain activity and somatosensory perception in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Balteau E, Schnakers C, Degueldre C, Moonen G, Luxen A, Phillips C, Peigneux P, Maquet P, Laureys S. '''Baseline brain activity fluctuations predict somatosensory perception in humans.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 17;104(29):12187-92. Epub 2007 Jul 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2008) also used the DCM in a study of the baseline state of consciousness of the human brain's [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Phillips C, Tshibanda L, Vanhaudenhuyse A, Schabus M, Dang-Vu TT, Moonen G, Hustinx R, Maquet P, Laureys S.

==History==
The concept of Digital Business Ecosystem was put forward in 2002 by a group of European researchers and practitioners, including Francesco Nachira, Paolo Dini and Andrea Nicolai, who applied the general notion of digital ecosystems to model the process of adoption and development of ICT-based products and services in competitive, highly fragmented markets like the European one&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, P Dini, A Nicolai. [http://www.digital-ecosystems.org/book/Introduction.pdf A Network of Digital Business Ecosystems for Europe: Roots, Processes and Perspectives in Digital Business ]. 2007, European Commission &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, A Nicolai, P Dini, M Le Louarn, L R Leon.

. Elizabeth Chang, [[Ernesto Damiani]] and Tharam Dillon started in 2007 the IEEE Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST). [http://spider.sigappfr.org/members/richard-chbeir/ Richard Chbeir], Youakim Badr, Dominique Laurent, and Hiroshi Ishikawa started in 2009 the ACM [http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES)]

==Perspectives==
The digital ecosystem metaphor and models have been applied to a number of business areas related to the production and distribution of knowledge-intensive products and services, including higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Damiani E., Uden, L, &amp; Trisnawaty W. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4233689/ The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem.] Inaugural IEEE Digital Ecosystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective of this research is providing methods and tools to achieve a set of objectives of the ecosystem (e.g. sustainability, fairness, bounded information asymmetry, risk control and gracious failure). These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to the Lorentz group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M. Perrault de son traité del'Origine des fontaines' [1763], ''Oeuvres Complétes de Christiaan Huygens'' (1897), Vol. '''7''', 298. Quoted in Jacques Roger, ''The Life Sciences in Eighteenth-Century French Thought'', ed. Keith R. Benson and trans. Robert Ellrich (1997), 163. Quotation selected by {{harvnb|Bynum|Porter|2005|p=317}} Huygens 317#4.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is what Einstein meant when he said, "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918-1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014. Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures. |journal=Energy Policy |volume=66|pages= 645–653 |date= |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">The '''marginal efficiency of capital''' (MEC) is that [[Discounting|rate of discount]] which would equate the price of a [[Fixed asset|fixed]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] [[asset]] with its [[Discounted cash flow|present discounted value of expected income]].

The term “marginal efficiency of capital” was introduced by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in his ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money|General Theory]]'', and defined as “the rate of [[discounting|discount]] which would make the [[present value]] of the series of [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuities]] given by the returns expected from the [[capital asset]] during its life just equal its supply price”.&lt;ref name="keynesDef"&gt;Keynes, John Maynard; ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money'' (1936), p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEC is the net rate of return that is expected from the purchase of additional capital. It is calculated as the profit that a firm is expected to earn considering the cost of inputs and the [[depreciation]] of capital. 
It is influenced by expectations about future input costs and demand. 
The MEC and capital outlays are the elements that a firm takes into account when deciding about an investment project.

The MEC needs to be higher than the [[rate of interest]], ''r'', for investment to take place. This is because the present value PV of future returns to capital needs to be higher than the cost of capital, C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.
These variables can be expressed as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;PV =\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i }{ (1 + r)^i},&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' is the number of years during which the capital will be productive, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the net return in year ''i'';
* &lt;math&gt;C_k =\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{ R_i }{ (1 + MEC)^i},&lt;/math&gt; where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the upfront capital outlays; this equation defines the MEC.
Hence, for investment to take place, it is necessary that PV &gt; C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, MEC &gt; r.
As a consequence, an inverse relationship between the rate of interest and investment is found (i.e.: a higher rate of interest generates less investment).

With the [[European Commission]] according to its data bank "AMECO" (Annual Macro-Economic Data) the Marginal efficiency of capital is defined as "Change in [[GDP]] at constant market prices of year T per unit of [[gross fixed capital formation]] at constant prices of year T-.5 [that is, lagged by half a year].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/ameco/user/serie/ResultSerie.cfm "Marginal Efficiency of Capital" in Ameco]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal profit''' is the difference between the [[marginal revenue]] and the [[marginal cost]]. Under the [[Profit maximization#Marginal cost-marginal revenue method|marginal approach to profit maximization]], to maximize profits, a firm should continue to produce a good or service up to the point where marginal profit is zero.

The most simple formula of Marginal profit is: Marginal revenue - Marginal cost. The derivate of the profit f(x) is in fact MP. In other words: p(x)=R(x)-C(x).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">In economics, the '''marginal rate of substitution''' ('''MRS''') is the rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of [[utility]].  At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical.

==As the slope of indifference curve==
Under the standard assumption of [[neoclassical economics]] that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an [[indifference curve]] (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the [[implicit derivative]]. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is [[Measure (mathematics)|quantified]], the marginal rate of substitution of good or service Y for good or service X (MRS&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;) is also equivalent to the [[marginal utility]] of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=-m_\mathrm{indif}=-(dy/dx) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=MU_x/MU_y \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an [[indifference curve]]), the [[marginal utility]] of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up.

For example, if the MRS&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X.

As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Simple mathematical analysis==
{{See|Implicit differentiation}}

Assume the consumer [[utility function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;U(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''U'' is consumer utility, ''x'' and ''y'' are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via [[partial differentiation]], as follows.

Also, note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x=\partial U/\partial x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_y=\partial U/\partial y &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ MU_x &lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal utility]] with respect to good ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\ MU_y &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility with respect to good ''y''.

By taking the [[total differential]] of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results:
:&lt;math&gt;\ dU=(\partial U/\partial x)dx + (\partial U/\partial y)dy &lt;/math&gt;, or substituting from above,

:&lt;math&gt;\ dU= MU_xdx + MU_ydy &lt;/math&gt;, or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x\frac{dx}{dx}+ MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.
Through any point on the indifference curve, ''dU/dx'' = 0,    because ''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', where ''c'' is a constant. It follows from the above equation that:
::&lt;math&gt; 0 = MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, or rearranging
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y}&lt;/math&gt;

The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest.  That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities:
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}= MU_x/MU_y.\, &lt;/math&gt;.

----

When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the [[budget line]], therefore, with ''m'' representing slope:

:&lt;math&gt;\ m_\mathrm{indif}=m_\mathrm{budget} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ -(MRS_{xy})=-(P_x/P_y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/MU_y=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/P_x=MU_y/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer's budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42349">In [[economics]], utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the '''marginal utility''' of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is the change in the utility from an increase in the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that good or service. 

In the context of [[cardinal utility]], economists sometimes speak of a '''law of diminishing marginal utility''', meaning that the first [[units of measurement|unit]] of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:
:MU&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;......&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

== Marginality ==
The term ''marginal'' refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As [[Philip Wicksteed]] explained the term,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowment]], meaning the total resources available for consumption (see [[Budget constraint]]). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.

For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]]. Under this assumption, [[marginal concepts]], including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of [[differential calculus]]. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.

In practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.

== Utility ==
{{Main|Utility}}
Depending on which theory of ''utility'' is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were ''quantifiable'', that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Development of Utility Theory'', I and II, ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1950), issues 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory'', ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.

Contemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully ''proxied'' by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and ''defines'' "utility" as such a quantification.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David Marc]]; ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory'', Chapter two: ''The theory of consumer choice and demand'', ''Utility representations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conception is [[Utilitarianism|Benthamite philosophy]], which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]]; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter I §I–III.&lt;/ref&gt; assumed subject to arithmetic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of [[John Stuart Mill]]), viewed utility as "the feelings of pleasure and pain"&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' v29 (June 1866) §2.&lt;/ref&gt; and further as a "''quantity'' of feeling" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; ''Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'', ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'' v29 (June 1866) §4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.
For example, the [[Austrian school]] generally attributes value to ''the satisfaction of wants'',&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl; ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (''Principles of Economics'') Chapter 2 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; ''Utility'', ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes rejects even the ''possibility'' of quantification.&lt;ref name="mises" &gt;[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Herbert Joseph; ''The Economics of Enterprise'' (1913) Ch VII, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the "law of diminishing marginal utility" (and is also known as [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s [[Gossen's laws|First Law]]). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. "The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including [[time preference]] and the [[Value (economics)|value of goods]] ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility."&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;

In modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time  is modeled via [[ordinal utility]], in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility ''is'' meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of [[cardinal utility]], which in modern economics is used in analyzing [[intertemporal choice]], [[expected utility hypothesis|choice under uncertainty]], and [[social welfare function|social welfare]].

The law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of [[diminishing returns]] which states that as the amount of one [[Factors of production|factor of production]] increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.

As the rate of commodity acquisition increases, ''marginal'' utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to '''zero''', reaching '''maximum''' total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become '''negative'''; this signifies '''dissatisfaction'''. For example,
* beyond some point, further doses of antibiotics would kill no pathogens at all, and might even become harmful to the body.
* to satiate thirst a person drinks water but beyond a point, consumption of more water might make the person vomit, hence leading to negative marginal and thus diminished total utility
* it takes a certain amount of food energy to sustain a population, yet beyond a point, more calories cannot be consumed and are simply discarded (or cause disease).

Diminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be ''increasing'' as well. For example:
* bed sheets, which up to some number may only provide warmth, but after that point may be useful to allow one to effect an escape by being tied together into a rope;
* tickets, for travel or theatre, where a second ticket might allow one to take a date on an otherwise uninteresting outing;
* dosages of antibiotics, where having too few pills would leave bacteria with greater resistance, but a full supply could effect a cure.
* the third leg is more useful than the first two when building a chair.

As suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the "tipping point" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple "yes" or "no" decision.

== Marginalist theory ==
[[Marginalism]] explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.

=== Market price and diminishing marginal utility ===
If an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.

In an economy with [[money]], the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining [[supply and demand]], as well as essential aspects of models of [[imperfect competition]].

==== The paradox of water and diamonds ====
{{Main|Paradox of value}}
The "paradox of water and diamonds", usually most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money"&lt;/ref&gt; though recognized by earlier thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.

Price is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the "paradox" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== Quantified marginal utility ==
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
[[Image:UtilityQuantified.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0} \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
exists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}=\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;.
Accordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, credited to the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] by [[Alfred Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred; ''Principles of Economics'',  3 Ch 3 Note.&lt;/ref&gt; was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (''border-use'').&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser,  Friedrich; ''Über  den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and  Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p.  128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="wieser_zwei"&gt;Wieser, Friedrich von; ''Der natürliche Werth''  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V  “Marginal Utility” ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soudek |first=Josef |title=Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=96 |issue=1 |year=1952 |pages=45–75 |jstor=3143742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauder |first=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=63 |issue=251 |year=1953 |pages=638–50 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Barry Lewis John |title=Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=1964 |jstor=1880547 |doi=10.2307/1880547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristoteles' Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists have concluded that there is ''some'' sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marchese Cesare di Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Della moneta'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.
[[Image:Richard Whately.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Richard Whately]]
[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac]], saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whatley's student [[Nassau William Senior|Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
[[Image:Gabriel Cramer.jpg|thumb|105px|Gabriel Cramer]]

The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/lloyd/value “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”], delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman |last=Seligman |first=E. R. A. |title=On Some Neglected British Economists |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=13 |issue=51 |pages=335–63 |year=1903 |jstor=2221519 |doi=10.2307/2221519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Michael V. |title=Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=60 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1992.tb00211.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dupuit |first=Jules |title=De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics |journal=Annales des ponts et chaussées |series=Second series |volume=8 |year=1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.
[[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]]
[[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility," but also to costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1879, 2nd ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=jevons+%22the+theory+of+political+economy%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IyxPG-thjm&amp;sig=ta6Vv6bIPxNZVaqyxFoGfv39Od8#PPA203,M1 ''The Theory of Political Economy''], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen" /&gt; (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published ''Grundsätze''.&lt;ref&gt;Kauder, Emil; ''A History of Marginal Utility Theory'' (1965), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;) Menger also developed the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Polleit, Thorsten (2011-02-11) [https://mises.org/daily/5014/What-Can-the-Law-of-Diminishing-Marginal-Utility-Teach-Us What Can the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Teach Us?], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.

[[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.

==== The second generation ====
[[Image:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]]
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://www.mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====
[[Karl Marx]] acknowledged that "nothing can have value, without being an object of utility",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; ''Capital'' V1 Ch 1 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in 1857 though not published until much later)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in his analysis, "use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl Heinrich]]: ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] (1859), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.

The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]]. However the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, ''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von: "''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems''" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;"On the Closure of the Marxist System"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's "The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism" (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "Das Kapital: A Criticism", ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder", ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf: ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904). Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Politicheskoy ekonomni rante'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin|Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Буха́рин, Никола́й Ива́нович (Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin)]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914). Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist [[Piero Sraffa]] providing an important critique of marginalism.

It might also be noted that some followers of [[Henry George]] similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mason Gaffney|Gaffney, Mason]], and Fred Harrison: ''The Corruption of Economics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Roemer]] and other [[Analytical Marxism#Exploitation|analytical Marxists]] have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.

=== Reformulation ===
In his 1881 work [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Yevgyeniy Ye.)]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. 2"Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but "old fashioned" and observationally unnecessary.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|[[John von Neumann]]]]
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; "Truth and Probability" ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie: ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.

A major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Peter, and Michael Rothschild, eds.: ''Uncertainty in Economics'' (1989). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies [[risk aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Demange, Gabriel, and Guy Laroque: ''Finance and the Economics of Uncertainty'' (2006), Ch. 3, pp. 71–72. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of [[Prudence#Prudence in economics and finance|prudence]], which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Miles (1990), "Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic. By Way of Clarification and Supplement to My Last Book Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-953708-2|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Meta-systems''' have several definitions. In general, they link the concepts "[[system]]" and "[[meta-]]". A "meta-system" is about other systems, such as describing, generalizing, modelling, or analyzing the other system(s).

According to [[Valentin Turchin|Turchin]] and [[Cliff Joslyn|Joslyn]] (1997), this "natural" systemic definition is not sufficient for their Theory of Meta-system Transition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; it also is not equivalent to the definition of ''[[system of systems]]'' in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In economics ==
In [[economics]], meta-systems are like what [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] calls general economies as opposed to the restricted economies of systems.

A book about the difference between general and restricted economies is ''Complementarity'' by [[Arshad Naim]]. In this case "meta" is defined as what is beyond: the meta-system is what lies beyond the system.

==In mathematics, biology and psychology==

In [[mathematics]], [[biology]] and [[psychology]], many variables have occurred within [[structure]]s and systems that [[determined]] the results, discoveries, [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] and [[Value (mathematics)|value]](s) of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], systems, and developments within systems, structures, systems within structures and sets of structures.

A [[mathematical]]-modelling rule system for a [[Scientific modelling|domain]] D is an example of a meta-system in mathematics and [[science]], for similar and [[consistency]] of concrete or [[frequency]] found in [[computer models|models]] within a domain. 
These are all modes or models; where commonalities are more consistent with consecutive scores or values within a [[range (statistics)|ranged order]] and are good indicators for gauging [[probability|probabilities]], traits (psychology) or properties (biology).

== In cultural studies and sociology ==
Meta-systems in [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] refer to contexts, milieux, situations, [[ecosystem]]s, [[natural environment|environments]] and the [[biological process]] with the use of commonalities in behavioral [[Trait theory|trait]]s and human developments found surrounding a [[social]] or [[scientific]] system which the system must interact with in order to remain viable. Meta-systems have different structures and also are complementary to other structures of such systems. Without this complementarity in the [[values]], [[Human bonding|bonding]]s, or [[tact (psychology)|tact]], the systems could not remain productive, viable or operational.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== In cybernetics==
The term "meta-system" (or "metasystem") in [[cybernetics]] is synonymous with [[management]] [[system]] or [[control system]]. [[Stafford Beer]], who founded [[management cybernetics]] with his [[viable system model]], speaks of metasystems that apply metalanguages which are able to find means of making decisions when necessary improvements cannot be made. In [[computer science]] this is known as the [[halting problem]]. Here metalanguage works in a larger context than the language it describes and has more [[variety (cybernetics)|variety]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

'''Negative gearing''' is a form of [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] whereby an [[investor]] borrows money to acquire an income-producing [[investment]] and the gross income generated by the investment (at least in the short term) is less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including [[depreciation]] and [[interest]] charged on the loan (but excluding capital repayments). The investor may enter into a negatively geared investment expecting [[tax]] benefits or the [[capital gain]] on the investment, when the investment is ultimately disposed of, to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is [[Tax deduction|tax-deductible]] against the investor's other taxable income and if the [[capital gain]] on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment. 

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
Negative gearing is often discussed with regard to [[real estate]], where [[rental income]] is less than [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] interest costs, but may also apply to [[Share (finance)|shares]] whose [[dividend]] income falls short of interest costs on a [[margin (finance)|margin loan]]. The tax treatment may or may not be the same between the two.

Positive gearing occurs when one borrows to invest in an income-producing asset and the returns (income) from that asset exceed the cost of borrowing. From then on, the investor must pay tax on the rental income profit until the asset is sold, when point the investor must pay capital gains tax on any profit.

When the income generated covers the interest, it is simply a geared investment, which creates [[passive income]]. A negative gearing strategy makes a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] under any of the following circumstances:

*if the asset rises in value so that the capital gain is more than the sum of the ongoing losses over the life of the investment
*if the income stream rises to become greater than the cost of interest (the investment becomes positively geared)
*if the interest cost falls because of lower [[Interest rate|interest rates]] or paying down the principal of the loan (again, making the investment positively geared)

The investor must be able to fund any shortfall until the asset is sold or until the investment becomes positively geared (income &gt; interest). The different tax treatment of planned ongoing losses and possible future capital gains affects the investor's final return. In countries that tax capital gains at a lower rate than income, it is possible for an investor to make a loss overall before taxation but a small gain after taxpayer subsidies.

Some countries, including Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries, including the US, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the UK or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/eJTR/2005/4.html#Heading447 "Quarantining Interest Deductions for Negatively Geared Rental Property Investments" &amp;#91;2005&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as [[stamp duty|stamp duties]] and [[capital gains tax]] may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2006/pdf/rdp2006-12.pdf Housing and Housing Finance: The View from Australia and Beyond, RBA &amp;#91;2006&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A negatively-geared investment property will generally remain negatively geared for several years, when the [[Renting|rental]] income will have increased with [[inflation]] to the point that the investment is positively geared (the rental income is greater than the interest cost).

The tax treatment of negative gearing (also termed "rental loss offset against other income") varies. For example:
* the United States restricts the practice to lower/middle income taxpayers who are active in managing their rental investment.
* Canada limits the practice by ensuring the investment generated a positive return over its life.
* the United States also allows interest costs against the family home to be fully tax deductible.
* countries with lower tax rates have a lower benefit from negative gearing due to a lower top rate of tax or a higher threshold for a specific tax rate.

==Negative gearing by country==
===Australia===
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}{{See also|Taxation in Australia}}

[[Australia]] allows the application of property losses arising from negative gearing against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Negative gearing by property investors reduced personal income tax revenue in Australia by $600 million in the 2001/02 tax year, $3.9 billion in 2004/05 and $13.2 billion in 2010/11.

Negative gearing is a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], during which the Labor Party proposed restricting (but not eliminating) negative gearing and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/policycheck-negative-gearing-reform-58404|title=PolicyCheck: Negative gearing reform|last=Wright|first=Danika|date=3 May 2016|newspaper=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-far-more-than-everyday-australians-analysis-shows-20151113-gkyllz.html|title=Negative gearing benefits the rich far more than everyday Australians, analysis shows|last=Hutchens|first=Gareth|date=13 November 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Treasurer of Australia|Federal Treasurer]] [[Scott Morrison]], in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that shows that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/scott-morrison-says-claims-negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-are-a-complete-and-utter-myth-20160425-goetex.html|title=Scott Morrison says claims negative gearing benefits the rich are 'a complete and utter myth'|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=26 April 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The raw numbers do not show the extent to which different professional groups benefit.)

====History====
Traditionally, Australian taxpayers have been allowed to negatively gear their investment properties, in the strict sense of investing in property at an initial loss. Negative gearing was restricted by a prohibition on the transfer of contingent property income and the property losses could not offset income from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/1987/27.pdf Avoidance, Evasion and Reform: Who Dismantled and who's rebuilding the Australian Income Tax System]&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed this applied to losses as well as income, but this is unclear in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/ INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common method of bypassing the restrictions on property losses offsetting income from labour was to convert such income into another form through the use of partnerships and other legal mechanisms. As a result, this restriction may not have been significant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} A partnership, trust or similar legal mechaninsm allowed an individual, or individuals, to pool their incomes and losses, thus allowing them to offset property losses against other incomes. This option was not available to individuals who derived their income from wages. 

In 1983, the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Deputy Commissioner of Taxation briefly denied Victorian property investors the deduction for interest in excess of the rental income, so losses could not be transferred nor moved to a future tax year. That ruling was quickly over-ruled by the federal tax commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rami|first=Hanegbi|year=2002|title=Negative Gearing: Future Directions|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/17.html#fnB21|journal=[[Deakin Law Review]]|volume=|issue=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1985, under the [[Australian Labor Party]] [[Hawke government]], negative gearing rules were changed so that property losses were no longer quarantined and instead could offset wage income. Six months later, following the tax summit in July 1985, the Hawke government undid this change, once more quarantining negative gearing interest expenses on new transactions so that they could be claimed only against rental income, not other income. (Any excess loss could be carried forward to offset property income in later years.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; That ensured that at personal level and, more importantly, at a national level, property losses would not be subsidised by income from personal exertion. In applying the formula, all previous governments thereby isolated and consequently discouraged capital speculation being subsidised from the general income tax receipts pool.

In addition, a [[capital gains tax]] (CGT) was introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985. While a separate tax, it is often associated with negative gearing.

The Hawke government's reversion to the earlier system in which property losses could not offset income from labour was unpopular with property investors. These investors claimed this reversion had caused investment in rental accommodation to dry up and rents to rise substantially. This was unsupported by evidence other than localised increases in real rents in both [[Perth]] and [[Sydney]], which also had the lowest vacancy rates of all capital cities at the time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100|title=Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?|last=ABC Fact Check|first=|date=3 March 2016|newspaper=|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in July 1987, after lobbying by the property industry, the Federal Labor government with [[Paul Keating]] as its Treasurer, reversed its decision once more, allowing negative gearing losses to be applied against income from labour.

====Taxation====
Australian tax treatment of negative gearing is as follows:

* Interest on an investment loan for an income producing purpose is fully deductible if the income falls short of the interest payable. The shortfall can be deducted for tax purposes from income from other sources, such as the wage or salary income of the investor.
* Ongoing maintenance and small expenses are similarly fully deductible.
* Property fixtures and fittings are treated as plant, and a deduction for [[depreciation]] is allowed based on effective life. When they are later sold, the difference between actual proceeds and the written-down value becomes income or further deduction.
* Capital works (buildings or major additions, constructed after 1997 or certain other dates) attract a 2.5% per annum capital works deduction (or 4% in certain circumstances). The percentage is calculated on the initial cost (or an estimate thereof) and can be claimed until the cost of the works has been completely recovered. The investor's cost base for capital gains tax purposes is reduced by the amount claimed.
* On sale, or most other methods of transfer of ownership, capital gains tax is payable on the proceeds minus cost base (excluding items treated as plant above). A net capital gain is taxed as income, but if the asset was held for one year or more, the gain is first discounted by 50% for an individual, or a third for a superannuation fund. (The discount began in 1999, prior to which an indexing of costs and a stretching of marginal rates applied instead.)

The tax treatment of negative gearing and capital gains may benefit investors in a number of ways, including:
*Losses are deductible in the financial year they are incurred and provide nearly immediate benefit.
*Capital gains are taxed in the financial year when a transfer of ownership occurs (or other less common triggering event), which may be many years after the initial deductions.
*If it is held for more than twelve months, only 50% of the capital gain is taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Esther|title=CGT exemptions, rollovers and concessions|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/capital-gains-tax/cgt-exemptions,-rollovers-and-concessions/|website=Australian Taxation Office|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transfer of ownership may be deliberately timed to occur in a year in which the investor is subject to a lower marginal tax rate, reducing the applicable capital gains tax rate compared to the tax rate saved by the initial deductions.

However, in certain situations the tax rate applied to the capital gain may be higher than the rate of tax saving because of initial deductions such as for investors who have a low marginal tax rate while they make deductions but a high marginal rate in the year the capital gain is realised.

In contrast, the tax treatment of real estate by [[owner-occupier]]s differs from investment properties. Mortgage interest and upkeep expenses on a private property are not deductible, but any capital gain (or loss) made on disposal of a primary residence is tax-free. (Special rules apply on a change from private use to renting or vice versa and for what is considered a main residence.)

====Arguments for and against====
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The economic and social effects of negative gearing in Australia are a matter of ongoing debate. Those in favour of negative gearing argue:

* Negatively-geared investors support the private residential tenancy market, assisting those who cannot afford to buy, and reducing demand on government [[public housing]].
* Investor demand for property supports the building industry, creating [[employment]].
* Tax benefits encourage individuals to invest and save, especially to help them become self-sufficient in [[retirement]].
* Startup losses are accepted as deductions for business and should also be accepted for investors since investors will be taxed on the result.
* Interest expenses deductible by the investor are income for the lender so there is no loss of tax revenue.
* Negatively-geared properties are running at an actual loss to the investor. Even though the loss may be used to reduce tax, the investor is still in a net worse position compared to not owning the property. The investor is expecting to make a profit either when the net rental income grows over time and exceeds the interest cost, or on the capital gain when the property is sold, or both. After sale, the treatment of the capital gain income is favoured by the tax system since the only half of the capital gain is assessed as taxable income if the investment is held for at least 12 months (before 2000–2001, only the real value of the capital gain was taxed, which had a similar effect). From that perspective, distortions are generated by the 50% discount on capital gains income for income tax purposes, not negative gearing.

Opponents of negative gearing argue:

* It encourages over-investment in residential property, which is an economic distortion.
* Investors inflate the residential property market, making it less affordable for first home buyers or other owner-occupiers.
* In 2007, nine out of ten negatively geared properties in Australia were existing dwellings so the creation of rental supply comes almost entirely at the expense of displacing potential owner-occupiers. Thus, if negative gearing is to exist, it should be applied only to newly constructed properties.
* It encourages [[Speculation|speculators]] into the property market, such as in the [[Australian property bubble]] that began in the mid-1990s, partly the result of increased availability of credit that occurred following the entry of non-bank lenders into the Australian mortgage market.
* Tax deductions and overall benefits accrue to those who already have high incomes, which will make the rich investors even richer and the poorer population even poorer, possibly creating and prolonging a social divide between socio-economic classes.
* Tax deductions reduce government revenue by a significant amount each year, so non-investors are subsidising investors and the government is less able to provide other programs.
* Business expenses (including interest payments) should be deductible against current or future income from that business, not against other forms of current income. Even if the tax code did not allow negative gearing offsets, the cost of operating the rental property (including interest payments) will be deductible from future net rental income or will reduce the capital gains tax at the time of sale of the property.

====Effect on rent prices====
The view that the temporary removal of negative gearing between 1985 and 1987 caused rents to rise has been challenged by Chief Economist of the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] Saul Eslake, who has been quoted as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's true, according to Real Estate Institute data, that rents went up in Sydney and Perth. But the same data doesn't show any discernible increase in the other state capitals. I would say that, if negative gearing had been responsible for a surge in rents, then you should have observed it everywhere, not just two capitals. In fact, if you dig into other parts of the REI database, what you find is that vacancy rates were unusually low at that time before negative gearing was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s991144.htm|title=Sparks fly over housing industry comments|last=|first=|date=17 November 2003|newspaper=[[Lateline]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eslake is referring to changes in inflation-adjusted rents (i.e., when [[Consumer price index|CPI]] inflation is subtracted from the nominal rent increases). These are also known as real rent changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nominal rents nationally rose by over 25% during the two years that negative gearing was quarantined. They rose strongly in every Australian capital city, according to the official [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] CPI data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6401.0Mar%202013&lt;/ref&gt; However, as nominal changes include inflation, they provide a less clear picture of how rents changed in effect, and of how changes such as disallowing property losses to offset other types of income affect rent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, it is difficult to assess the impact no longer allowing such deductions had during those two years, given that these deductions had only been allowed for six months prior to their disallowance in July 1985.

An ABC Fact check report, posted on the 3rd of March 2016 and titled "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100 Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?]" provided the following, after inflation, rental cost changes, during the period negative gearing was abolished. (Rounded to whole numbers and listed by size of city). Sydney +2% to +4%, Melbourne +2% to 0%, Brisbane -3% to -4%, Perth 0% to +6% and Adelaide +1% to -3%. All values have the effects of inflation removed, which in 1986 was [http://www.in2013dollars.com/Australia-inflation-rate-in-1986 9.18%]. 

As a comparison with house pricing, the [http://www.econ.mq.edu.au/Econ_docs/research_papers2/2004_research_papers/Abelson_9_04.pdf medium house price] in Sydney rose from $98000, in 1985, to $120025, in 1986, or after inflation, by 12.18%. In Brisbane the medium house price moved from $61550 to $63000, in the same period, or an after inflation, a change of -6.25%. The medium unit price in Sydney moved from $70500 to $72300, in the same period. An after inflation change of -6.07%. In brisbane the after inflation change for units was -0.05%.

====Effect on housing affordability====
[[File:20100517 Australian House Price Index 1986 - 2009.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Chart 1: House Price Index and CPI. Source ABS]]
In 2003, the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] (RBA) stated in its submission to the [[Productivity Commission]] First Home Ownership Inquiry: &lt;blockquote&gt;there are no specific aspects of current tax arrangements designed to encourage investment in property relative to other investments in the Australian tax system. Nor is there any recent tax policy initiative we can point to that accounts for the rapid growth in geared property investment. But the fact is that when we observe the results, resources and finance are being disproportionately channelled into this area, and property promoters use tax effectiveness as an important selling point.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/housing-and-housing-finance/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home/pdf/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home.pdf|title=Productivity Commission Inquiry on First Home Ownership: Submission by Reserve Bank of Australia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;They went on to say that "the most sensible area to look for moderation of demand is among investors", and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the taxation treatment in Australia is more favourable to investors than is the case in other countries. In particular, the following areas appear worthy of further study by the Productivity Commission:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;i. ability to negatively gear an investment property when there is little prospect of the property being cash-flow positive for many years;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ii. the benefit that investors receive by virtue of the fact that when property depreciation allowances are "clawed back" through the capital gains tax, the rate of tax is lower than the rate that applied when depreciation was allowed in the first place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iii. the general treatment of property depreciation, including the ability to claim depreciation on loss-making investments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Investor Lending - new vs existing to Feb 2010.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Chart 2: Investor Lending – New construction vs Existing property. Source ABS, RBA]]

In 2008, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia echoed the findings of the 2004 Productivity Commission report. One recommendation to the enquiry suggested that negative gearing should be capped: "There should not be unlimited access. Millionaires and billionaires should not be able to access it, and you should not be able to access it on your 20th investment property. There should be limits to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/hsaf/report/index|title=A good house is hard to find: Housing affordability in Australia|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report from the Senate Economics References Committee argues that, while negative gearing has an influence on housing affordability, the primary issue is a mismatch between supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Affordable_housing_2013/Report|title=Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Economics References Committee|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A submission to this committee from the Department of Social Services stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;[while] demand for housing has increased significantly over the last 30 years, the supply of new dwellings has not responded, with average annual completions of new dwellings remaining around 150,000 since the mid-1980s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The effect of negative gearing on the supply side of dwelling construction is difficult to pin down. Commentary from Eslake and others has highlighted the preponderance of negatively-geared purchases in established suburbs where the probability of a lightly-taxed capital gain exists, challenging the idea that negative gearing leads to substantial amounts of new construction. Many economists{{Who|date=February 2017}} have commented extensively on the tax subsidy being made available to speculative buyers in competition against homebuyers, who have no such tax subsidy, leading to significant social dislocation.

Additionally, the tax subsidy feeding into higher home prices adds to the wealth of those taking advantage of negative gearing. The process that crowds out domestic home owners by pushing up the price of housing also makes the successful user of negative gearing more asset rich due to the increase in land value. This allows these people to borrow further funds against equity in the previously acquired properties, resulting in further acquisitions under tax subsidy. This process can raise prices and thereby make it harder for people who wish to buy a house as an owner-occupier.

===United Kingdom===
While allowing for negative gearing in its basic form, the United Kingdom does not allow the transfer of one type of income (or loss) to another type of income. This is due to its [[schedular system of taxation]]. In this type of taxation system, the tax paid is dependent on income source. Therefore, an individual who received an income from labour and from land would pay two separate tax rates for the two relevant income sources.

Between 1997 and 2007, the [[Tax Law Rewrite Project]] changed this system by simplifying the schedules. As with the previous system, people would not be allowed to transfer incomes (or losses).

A UK government online resource on renting out property in England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/renting-out-a-property/paying-tax Renting out your property (England and Wales)]&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how to offset losses. It states that losses can be offset against "future profits by carrying it forward to a later year" or against "profits from other properties (if you have them)".

===New Zealand===
New Zealand allows negative gearing and the transfer of losses to other income streams, with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://international.harcourts.net/negative-gearing-explained/ Harcourts - “Negative Gearing” Explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rental Income Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/individualincometax/ir264-guide-rental-income.html  IRD - Rental income IR264]&lt;/ref&gt; states a loss can only be deducted against other incomes if the rental income is at market rate.

The Opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] attempted to raise negative gearing in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], but after their failure to win government the issue reduced in significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2011/05/nz-moves-to-quarantine-negative-gearing/ NZ moves to quarantine negative gearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{See also|Taxation in Canada}}
In principle, Canada does not allow the transfer of income streams. However, the most current Canadian tax form indicates this can occur in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative_gearing.asp Investopedia - Negative Gearing]&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses", interest payments from an investment designed to generate an income can be deducted:&lt;blockquote&gt;Claim the following carrying charges and interest you paid to earn income from investments: [...] Most interest you pay on money you borrow for investment purposes, but generally only if you use it to try to earn investment income, including interest and dividends. However, if the only earnings your investment can produce are capital gains, you cannot claim the interest you paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns206-236/221/menu-eng.html CRA Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other sources indicate the deduction must be reasonable and that people should contact the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] for more information. The "Rental Income Includes Form T776"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4036/t4036-e.html#P558_52811|title=Rental Income 2016: Rental losses|last=|first=|date=|website=Canada Review Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; states people can deduce rental losses from other sources of income: "You have a rental loss if your rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. If you incur the expenses to earn income, you can deduct your rental loss against your other sources of income." However, there is a caveat: the rental loss must be reasonable. What is reasonable is not defined in the "Rental Income Includes Form T776" Guide.

Based on these sources, claiming rental losses against other incomes in a given year is allowed as long as a profit is made over the life of the investment, excluding the effects of capital gains.

It should be noted that Canada has a Federal and Provincial income tax, and the above only relates to Federal income tax.

===United States===
In principle, the US federal tax does not allow the transfer of income streams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc414.html IRS Topic 414 - Rental Income and Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, taxpayers can only deduct expenses of renting property from their rental income, as renting property out is usually considered a passive activity. However, if renters are considered to have actively participated in the activities, they can claim deductions from rental losses against their other "nonpassive income".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A definition of "active participation" is outlined in the "Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses" guide:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html#en_US_2015_publink1000219121 IRS Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and ''bona fide'' sense. Management decisions that may count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and other similar decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is possible deduct any loss against other incomes, depending on a range of factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxes.about.com/od/taxhelp/a/Schedule_E.htm Rental Income and Expenses - Tips for Schedule E]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan allows tax payers to offset rental losses against other income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=4188 Authorities challenge real estate loss deduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can claim losses against rental loss with minimal restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Real_estate_income.pdf Analysis of Income (use for real estable income)]&lt;/ref&gt; but if the property was owned through a partnership or trust there are restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=3882 The Japanese taxation of real estate income for individuals]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of additional rules, such as restricting claims of losses due to Bad Debt. Additional information can be found in the Japan Tax Site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/ The Japan tax Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Taxation in Germany|German tax system]] is complex, but within the bounds of standard federal income tax, Germany does not allow the transfer of income. Rental losses can only be offset against rental income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Germany/Taxes-and-Costs Rental income tax is high in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the Global Property Guide site, "Owners can deduct any expenses from the gross receipts, which were incurred to produce, maintain and safeguard that income."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany recognizes seven sources of income:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweizer.com.au/documents/P130277_028.pdf The German tax System]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Agriculture and forestry
# Trade and business
# Independent personal services
# Employment
# Capital investment
# Rents and royalties
# "other income", as specified and strictly limited by law to certain types of income such as income from private transactions and income of a recurring nature (e.g. pensions)

The income from each of these sources is calculated separately.

Rental income is taxed as income and is subject to the [[progressive tax]] rate. Interest on loans provided to finance real estate, expenses, and property-related cost (e.g., management fees, insurance) can be deducted from the taxable rental income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germany.alphare.net/pdf/German-Property-Tax-Overview.pdf German Tax Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In principle, the [[Taxation in the Netherlands|Dutch tax system]] does not allow the transfer of income. Most citizens calculate tax, separately, in 3 income groups:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-netherlandsguide-2015.pdf Taxation and Investment in Netherlands 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Box 1 income includes income from employment and income from the primary residence
# Box 2 income, which includes income from a substantial holding in a company, as well as gains from substantial shareholdings
# Box 3 deals with income from savings and investments

However, I am unable to identify a clear definition where rental income fits in these three categories in the government taxation laws. 

Dutch resident and non-resident companies and partnerships owning Dutch property are in principle allowed to deduct interest expenses on loans from banks or affiliated companies, and property-related costs from their taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwc.fr/assets/files/pdf/2013/07/Global_real_estate/2012_netherlands.pdf Real Estate Going Global Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Negative refraction''' is the name for an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] phenomenon where [[light]] [[ray (optics)|rays]] are [[refraction|refracted]] at an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] in the reverse sense to that normally expected.  Such an effect can be obtained using a [[metamaterial]] which has been designed to achieve a [[negative number|negative]] value for both (electric) [[permittivity]] ε and (magnetic) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative [[refractive index]]. Such materials are sometimes called "double negative" materials.

Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive [[phase velocity]] (i.e. a positive [[refractive index]]), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative [[refractive index]]).

==Negative phase velocity==

Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a [[optical medium|medium]].  There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veselago|first=Viktor G|date=1968-04-30|title=THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTANCES WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATIVE VALUES OF $\epsilon$ AND μ|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1070%2FPU1968v010n04ABEH003699|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514|doi=10.1070/pu1968v010n04abeh003699|issn=0038-5670}}&lt;/ref&gt; of opposition of [[wavevector]] and (Abraham)  [[Poynting vector]], i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of [[wavevector]] to [[group velocity]], or to [[energy velocity]]. The use of "phase velocity" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate "wave vector", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.

A typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector is negative (i.e. that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{P}\cdot\vec{k}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;); however this definition is not [[General covariance|covariant]].  Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. W. McCall|doi=10.1016/j.metmat.2008.05.001|title=A Covariant Theory of Negative Phase Velocity Propagation|journal=Metamaterials|volume=2|issue=2–3|page=92|year=2008|bibcode = 2008MetaM...2...92M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule.  This gives rise to the name "left-handed (meta)materials". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.

== Negative refractive index ==
[[Image:metarefraction.svg|thumb|A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material]]
[[File:Negative refraction.ogv|thumb|Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface.]]

We can choose to avoid directly considering the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly: that is, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in [[#Negative phase velocity|negative phase velocity]] (NPV).  Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. [[Attenuation|lossy]]) material to display negative refraction.  The most general [[Victor Veselago|Veselago]] criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia|Lakhtakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R. A. Depine and A. Lakhtakia |doi = 10.1002/mop.20127 |title = A new condition to identify isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials displaying negative phase velocity |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |pages = 315–316 |year = 2004 |arxiv = physics/0311029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other less general forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = P. Kinsler and M. W. McCall |doi = 10.1002/mop.23489 |title = Criteria for negative refraction in active and passive media |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 50 |issue = 7 |page = 1804 |year = 2008 |arxiv = 0806.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depine-Lakhtakia criterion for negative phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r|\mu|+ \mu_r |\epsilon| &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r, \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Tom G.|last2=Lakhtakia|first2=Akhlesh|date=2009-06-12|title=Negative refraction, negative phase velocity, and counterposition in bianisotropic materials and metamaterials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121|journal=Physical Review B|volume=79|issue=23|pages=235121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J. Skaar |doi = 10.1364/OL.31.003372 |title = On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector |journal = [[Optics Letters]] |volume = 31 |issue = 22 |pages = 3372–3374 |year = 2006 |arxiv = physics/0607104 |bibcode = 2006OptL...31.3372S |citeseerx = 10.1.1.261.8030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[refractive index]] ''n'' is determined using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n =\pm\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for ''n''.  However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed.  Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of ''n'' must be chosen to match the physical situation.

==Refraction==
The principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are 
refracted on the ''same'' side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of [[Snell's law]].

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In [[western astrology|astrology]], a '''negative''', '''ceptive''', '''dispassive''', '''yin''', '''nocturnal''' or '''feminine''' sign refers to any of the six even-numbered signs of the [[zodiac]]: [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] or [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

These signs constitute the [[earth sign|earth]] and [[water sign|water]] [[triplicity|triplicities]].

==Introduction to signs==
In astrology there are two groups: positive and negative. These two groups also
include six individual signs that are called zodiac signs. The negative signs associated
with the zodiac are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. The positive
signs associated with the zodiac are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and
Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twelve signs are divided into two
groups based upon one's exact time and place of birth. The negative and positive signs
alternate, starting with Aries as positive and Taurus as negative and continuing this pattern through the list of zodiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Michael|title=History of Astrology-Origins and Beginnings|url=http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|publisher=Astrology insight|accessdate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075959/http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different types of sign terminology==
The signs negative and positive are referred to as a negative-sunsign or a
positive-sunsign. There are many terms used in astrology to differentiate the
two groups. In Chinese astrology, the two groups are categorized as yin and yang, corresponding respectively to negative and positive.  Standen explains that different astrologers may refer to signs by different names. For example, an astrologer may refer to positive signs as masculine and negative signs as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaj Sudhanshu|first=Rajendra|title=Positive &amp; Negative Sign|url=http://www.subhanshu.com/astrology/positive-negative-sign.htm|publisher=Subhanshu.com|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each sign is divided into two main
types: active and passive. As a general rule, the active type will be called masculine and the passive type will be called feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standen|first=Anthony|title=Is There An Astrological Effect On Personality|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=1975|volume=89|issue=2|pages=259–260|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vjrl20|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative Zodiacs==
Zodiac signs associated with the negative are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Note that there is no value judgment attached to the terms negative or positive. They may be likened to polarities in a magnet: one side is positive and one side is negative. Neither side is "good" nor "bad"—they are merely different.

==The “Sunsign Effect”==
The sunsign effect is a pattern of alternating high and low extraversion-scores for
the 12 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introvert is a person who gains energy when alone and spends it when with other people. Extravert is a person who gains energy from socialization, expending it when alone. Jan J.F. van Rooij did an experiment on Introversion-Extraversion: astrology
versus psychology, to see if those in the negative sunsign were introverted and those in
the positive sunsign were negative. Van Rooijs did this experiment on those with
astrological knowledge and on those with no astrological knowledge. His results showed
that negative sunsign people are not that responsive to the outer world and are
accordingly not influenced that easily by astrological information. They rely more on
their own ideas and feelings, thus proving his point that people who are born with the
negative sunsign are introverted, and those born with the positive sunsign are
extroverted.

==Element Associated with negative signs==
Earth and Water are the elements attached to those who are in the negative sign.
Earth is the element of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Water is the element of Cancer,
Scorpio, and Pisces. Elements are the basic traits of the signs. They reveal the
fundamental aspects of the personality.
“Water signs are attuned to waves of emotion, and often seem to have a built-in
sonar for reading a mood. This gives them a special sensitivity in relationships, knowing
when to show warmth and when to hold back. At their best, they are a healing force that
bring people together -- at their worst, they are psychic vampires, able to manipulate
and drain the life force of the closest to them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall explains that water signs are
more in tune with their emotions and are comfortable showing them. Water signs bring a
certain presence to a situation; they seek out the problem and fix it.
“Earth signs are sensual, meaning they engage with life through the five senses.
It takes time to sense the dense physical world, and earth signs can operate at a slower,
more thorough pace than the other elements. Theyʼre oriented toward whatʼs real, and
often this makes them very productive, able to create tangible results.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earth signs are described by Hall as earthy people. These signs focus on the things
that connect us to the earth: things which bring peace, as opposed to focusing on the material world.

'''Negative utilitarianism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[utilitarianism]] that gives greater priority to reducing [[suffering]] (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing [[pleasure|happiness]] (positive utility).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Leslie|1998|page=12}}: "'Negative utilitarianism' is concerned mainly or entirely with reducing evils rather than with maximizing goods." The example unpleasant experiences is an example based on a hedonistic theory of well-being, according to which pleasant experiences are good for individuals and unpleasant experiences are bad for individuals. But there are other theories of well-being and negative utilitarianism need not adopt a hedonistic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|loc=chpt. 4}} The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the ''only'' thing that ultimately matters morally.{{sfn|Smart|1958}} Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are ''only'' concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that ''both'' positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} says that strong versions of negative utilitarianism "give all weight to disutility" and weak versions "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.” {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the well-being in an outcome depends on [[antifrustrationism|frustrated preferences]]. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.

The term "negative utilitarianism" was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. Ninian Smart]] in 1958 in his reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism:{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering.  {{sfn|Smart|1958|p=542}} Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.

== History ==
The term ‘negative utilitarianism’ was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] in his 1958 reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|p=542}}: "Professor Popper has proposed a negative formulation of the utilitarian principle, so that we should replace ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’ by ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’. He says: ‘It adds to the clarity of ethics if we formulate our demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of suffering rather than the promotion of happiness’. However, one may reply to negative utilitarianism..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Popper wrote, "I suggest, for this reason, to replace the utilitarian formula ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’. {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415610216|page=548}} Popper claimed that "there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula "Maximize pleasure" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all..." {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contestabile|2014|page=298}}: "Negative utilitarianism and Buddhism share the following intuitions: Negative utilitarianism—understood as an umbrella term—models the asymmetry between suffering and happiness and therefore accords with the Buddhist intuition of universal compassion. The Noble Truths of Buddhism accord with the negative utilitarian intuition that (global) suffering cannot be compensated by happiness. Some forms of Buddhism and negative utilitarianism share the intuition that non-existence is a perfect state." {{harvnb|Goodman|2009|page=101}}: “Negative utilitarianism shares with Buddhism a strong focus on alleviating the suffering of beings.”&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keown|1992|page=175}}: “one of the earliest exponents of NU, Hegesias...”&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist [[Edmund Gurney]] who wrote:

{{quote|Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability . . . of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer . . . in the negative. . . . When we forget pain, or underestimate it, or talk about people 'getting used to it', we are really so far losing sight of what the universe, which we wish to conceive adequately, really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.com/gurney/index.html|title=Edmund Gurney (1847 - 88)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Versions of negative utilitarianism ==
Like other kinds of [[utilitarianism]], negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the ''actual'' or ''expected'' consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the ''average'' outcome among individuals or the ''total'' net utility (or lack of disutility) among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinnott-Armstrong|2014}} provides a nice overview of the many ways in which consequentialism can be varied. Since utilitarianism (and negative utilitarianism) is a kind of consequentialism, much of it applies to utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as well. Section 1. "Classic Utilitarianism" shows the many distinct and variable claims that make up Classic Utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative utilitarianism can aim either to ''optimize'' the value of the outcome or it can be a ''satisficing'' negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be ''sufficiently'' valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=102}}, states satisficing utilitarianism as follows: "''Satisficing utilitarianism'' An action ought to be done if and only if it would bring about a sufficient level of total well-being."&lt;/ref&gt; A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.

=== The weight of evil (disutility) ===
Philosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility.&lt;ref&gt;They write that they distinguish among kinds of 'negative utilitarianism': "Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family. The problem was then to find out which members of this family we want to join, and to spell out why we do not want to be as some of our siblings." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}. The taxonomy is phrased in terms of 'negativisms,' which appear to be the same as 'negativist' and 'negative' utilitarianisms: "we believe that disutility has greater weight than utility. The overall aim with this part of our essay is to give an account of this weight, which means that we shall try to formulate a welfarist act-consequentialism that takes seriously the weight of disutility. In other words, we are looking for an acceptable negativist utilitarianism." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pp=30,38}} They first distinguish between ''strong negativism'' and ''weak negativism''. Strong negativism "give all weight to disutility" and weak negativism "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=39}}: "The claim that disutility has greater weight can now be expressed by letting the disutilities have greater lexical weight. But still the utility has some weight in the sense that if the disutilities are the same in the alternatives, and hence we cannot minimise the disutility any further, then we ought to maximise the utility. Depending on what kinds of disutilities we choose in establishing this order, we get different lexical negativisms."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "''Lexical Threshold NU''
Suffering and happiness both count, but there is some amount of suffering that no amount of happiness can outweigh."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not "agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Tomasik formulated and advocated consent-based negative utilitarianism. He writes, "would the person-moment suffering agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future? If yes, then the suffering doesn't pass the threshold of unbearableness and thus can be outweighed by happiness." {{harvnb|Tomasik|2015}}. See section “Consent-based negative utilitarianism?” The ‘person-moment’ means the person in the moment of suffering, as opposed to before or after the suffering occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other distinctions among versions of negative utilitarianism ===
[[Thomas Metzinger]] proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metzinger|2003|page=622}}: “In terms of a fundamental solidarity of all suffering beings against suffering, something that almost all of us should be able to agree on is what I will term the “principle of negative utilitarianism”: Whatever else our exact ethical commitments and specific positive goals are, we can and should certainly all agree that, in principle, and whenever possible, the overall amount of conscious suffering in all beings capable of conscious suffering should be minimized. I know that it is impossible to give any truly conclusive argument in favor of this principle. And, of course, there exist all kinds of theoretical complications—for example, individual rights, long-term preferences, and epistemic indeterminacy. But the underlying intuition is something that can be shared by almost everybody: We can all agree that no additional suffering should be created without need. Albert Camus once spoke about the solidarity of all finite beings against death, and in just the same sense there should be a solidarity of all sentient beings capable of suffering against suffering. Out of this solidarity we should not do anything that would increase the overall amount of suffering and confusion in the universe—let alone something that highly ''likely'' will have this effect right from the beginning.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Bunge]] writes about negative utilitarianism in his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "By recommending passivity it [negative utilitarianism] condones evil. The spectator who watches impassively a hooligan attacking an old woman, and the citizen who does not bother to vote, comply with negative utilitarianism and thereby tolerate evil."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The benevolent world-exploder ==
In the 1958 article where [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, "a benevolent world-exploder," would have a duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|page=542}}: "Suppose that a ruler controls a weapon capable of instantly and painlessly destroying the human race. Now it is empirically certain that there would be some suffering before all those alive on any proposed destruction day were to die in the natural course of events. Consequently the use of the weapon is bound to diminish suffering, and would be the ruler's duty on NU grounds." For his use of the term ‘the benevolent world-exploder’ see page 543.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism,{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the argument is directed against strong versions of negative utilitarainaism that prescribe only reducing negative well-being, as well as weak versions that are sufficiently close to strong negative utilitarianism. Such weak versions would be those that, although they give weight to both negative and positive well-being, give sufficiently much more the weight to negative well-being, so that they would have the same implications as strong versions in relevant situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have endorsed this argument,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "Negative utilitarianism ... is open to the following objections.... Fourthly, the most expeditious way of implementing the doctrine would be to exterminate humankind, for then human suffering would cease altogether (R. N. Smart 1958)." {{harvnb|Heyd|1992|p=60}}: "Negative utilitarianism, which seems promising in guiding us in genethics, also urges (at least in its impersonal version) paradoxical (and to some, morally abhorrent) solutions to the miseries of humanity. Primarily it recommends the painless annihilation of all humanity—either by the collective suicide of all actual beings, or by total abstention from procreation by one generation (Smart 1958, 542-543)." {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "R. N. Smart wrote a response [3] in which he christened the principle 'Negative Utilitarianism' and showed a major unattractive consequence. A thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means) as the suffering involved would be small compared to the suffering in everyday life in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.

=== Cooperation between different value systems ===
One possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains from Trade through Compromise – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html|title = Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminating vs. reducing disutility ===
Another reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating.&lt;ref&gt;This is essentially [[H. B. Acton]]'s reply. {{harvnb|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=84}}: "Eliminating suffering is not the same thing as reducing it or as arriving at 'the least amount of avoidable suffering for all', and it is the latter, not the former, that might, with some plausibility, be regarded as a possible substitute for the more usual form of utilitarianism. Would not, then, the destroyer imagined by Smart be making a terrible mistake through failing to notice the difference between eliminating and reducing?"&lt;/ref&gt; A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[J. J. C. Smart]]'s reply to Acton. J. J. C. Smart agrees with his brother R. N. Smart that "if we made the minimization of misery our sole ultimate ethical principle ... we should approve of a tyrannical but benevolent world exploder." {{harvnb|Smart|1973|page=29}} J. J. C. Smart replies to Acton that "surely eliminating is a case of reducing – the best case of all, the negative utilitarian would say. In suggesting that eliminating is not reducing, Acton seems to me to be like a person who says that zero is not a number." {{harvnb|Smart|1989||p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempting world destruction would be counterproductive ===
Several philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], who says that "planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution."{{sfn|Pearce|2005}} Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that "life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed."{{sfn|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}} A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that "anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful."&lt;ref&gt;Clark Wolf proposes and defends ‘negative critical level utilitarianism’ in the context of social choice and population choices, which says that "population choices should be guided by an aim to minimize suffering and deprivation" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=273}}. He brings up the possible objection to his principle that "it might occur to someone that the best way to minimize current suffering and deprivation would be to quietly, secretly, and painlessly kill off all of those who are miserable and needy" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}. A part of his reply is that "die hard utilitarians could argue that we rarely face such a policy choice, and that anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question "3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?" begins with "No, that would very bad even by NU standards."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}

=== Life could evolve again in a worse way ===
Some replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by [[John W. N. Watkins]] is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. N. Watkins]] describes himself as "a sort of negative utilitarian" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=95}}. He replies to R. N. Smart that "even if all life ''were'' destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again—this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very ''possibility'' of life. And I like to think that this is something which is ''in principle'' beyond human power" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,

{{quote|I am also a little puzzled by Watkin's remark that the pain minimizer would have to destroy the ''very possibility'' of life. If the sentient forms of life were totally destroyed, it might be that the sentient forms would be most unlikely to evolve. This is on the supposition, held by some experts, that the evolution of higher forms of life on earth depended on a lot of lucky accidents. If this is not the case, then the benevolent world destroyer should ensure that ''all'' forms of life are destroyed, even bacteria and plants and insects, but should this be impossible the world destroyer might have at least ensured a pain free globe for hundreds of millions of years to come. In any case my brother's example was of a world ''exploder'', and I think this would ensure the destruction of ''all'' life on earth. Of course there might be sentient life on planets of distant stars. No doubt the world exploder can do nothing about this, even with the resources of a future physics, but his or her negative utilitarian duty would not be to do the impossible, but would be to minimize suffering as much as lies within his or her power.{{sfn|Smart|1989||pp=44-45}}}}

=== Getting killed would be a great evil ===
Another related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: "He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them."{{sfn|Kadlec|2008|110}}

=== Frustrated preferences ===
Negative [[preference utilitarianism]] has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions.&lt;ref&gt;"A preferentialist could, for example, claim that most people now living prefer to live, and that these preferences must be counted when elimination is at stake. So, the elimination results in a lot of frustrated preferences, and we must balance the evil ofthis against the evil of the unhappiness in the future of humanity." {{harv|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}} Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}}

The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;"NIPU [negative ideal preference utilitarianism] isn’t about minimizing the amount of unsatisfied preferences that currently exist, but rather about minimizing the total amount of unsatisfied preferences in the (space-time) universe. This includes past preferences." {{harv|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that "instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}. See section "2.1.5 Back to destroying the world, doesn’t NIPU still imply that extinction would be best, because if there will be a lot of people in the future, their unsatisfied preferences combined are worse than the preferences being thwarted by extinction?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining negative utilitarianism with rights ===
A part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,

{{quote|A more direct way to address this problem would be to incorporate a theory of rights, stipulating that in general, policy makers simply have no right to make decisions about whether the lives of others are worth living, or whether they should live or die. Since it is clear that policy makers have no right to kill off the miserable and destitute, this response gains support from our moral intuitions.{{sfn|Wolf|1996|p=278}}}}

Negative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice.{{sfn|Contestabile|Negative Utilitarianism and Justice}} Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims{{sfn|Rawls|1958|p=174}} and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.

[[Toby Ord]] provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay "Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,"{{sfn|Ord|2013}} to which [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] and Bruno Contestabile have replied.{{sfn|Pearce|A response to Toby Ord's essay}}{{sfn|Contestabile|Why I’m (Not) a Negative Utilitarian – A Review of Toby Ord’s Essay}} Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|2012|pages=1–2}}: "Negative utilitarianism is well-known for entailing anti-natalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud."&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Belshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belshaw|2012|page=118}}: "Negative utilitarianism can be plucked from the shelf, but there is no good reason to suppose it true. And were it true, it would take us too far, generating not only anti-natalism but straightaway also its pro-mortalist neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingmar Persson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|2009|page=38}}: “negative utilitarianism seems implausible, as is shown by an argument sketched by McMahan, on the basis of an argument originally put forward by Richard Sikora (1978). This argument turns on the observation that if what would be bad for individuals in life is a reason against conceiving them, but what would be good for them is no reason in favour of conceiving them, then, as far as those individuals are concerned, it is wrong to conceive them, however much good their lives will contain, provided that they will also contain something that is bad for them. This seems clearly absurd.”&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle

That too suggests we should concern ourselves before all else with the elimination of pain.{{sfn|Mendola|1990|p=86}}}} Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiz|1992|page=423}}: "Utilitarianism failed, but what is sometimes called ‘negative utilitarianism’ avoids many of the shortcomings of classical utilitarianism. It is a good candidate for an ethics that expresses the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian Fricke published the German article "Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus."{{sfn|Fricke|2002}} In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings.{{sfn|Leighton|2011}}

'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov JJ McCall – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Vernon, VA |publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems |isbn=978-0-9818193-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L.

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David M. Boulton; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 11, Issue 2, 1968 Page(s):185–194, "An information measure for classification."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David L. Dowe; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 4, Sep 1999 Page(s):270–283, "Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a connection between Occam's razor and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|title=A short introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length|last=Nannen|first=Volker|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602044851/http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

The '''original camera negative''' ('''OCN''') is the film in a traditional film-based [[movie camera]] which captures the original image.  This is the film from which all other copies will be made. It is known as '''raw stock''' prior to exposure.

The size of a roll varies depending on the [[film gauge]] and whether or not a new roll, [[re-can]], or [[short end]] was used. One hundred or 400 foot rolls are common in 16mm, while 400 or 1,000 foot (ft) rolls are used in 35mm work. While these are the most common sizes, other lengths such as 200, 800, or 1,200 ft may be commercially available from film stock manufacturers, usually by special order. Rolls of 100 and 200 ft are generally wound on spools for daylight-loading, while longer lengths are only wound around a plastic core. Core-wound stock has no exposure protection outside its packaging, and therefore must be loaded into a [[camera magazine]] within a [[darkroom]] or changing bag/tent in order to prevent the film being fogged.

== Value ==
Original camera negative is of great value, as if lost or damaged it cannot be re-created without re-shooting the scene, something which is often impossible. It also contains the highest-quality version of the original image available, before any analog resolution and dynamic range loss from copying. For these reasons, original camera negative is handled with great care, and only by specialized trained people in dedicated film laboratories.

==Procedures in the laboratory==
After the film is processed by the [[film lab]], camera rolls are assembled into lab rolls of 1,200 to 1,500 ft. Work prints may be made for viewing dailies or editing the picture on film.

Once [[film editing]] is finalized, a [[negative cutting|negative cutter]] will conform the negative using the [[Keykode]] on the edge of the film as a reference, cutting the original camera negative and incorporating any opticals (titles, dissolves, fades, and special effects), and cementing it together into several rolls. 

The edited original negative is then copied to create a safety positive which can be used as a backup to create a usable negative. At this point, an [[answer print]] will be created from the original camera negative, and upon its approval, [[interpositive]]s (IPs) and [[internegative]]s (INs) are created, from which the [[release print]]s are made. Generally speaking, the original camera negative is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an answer print is approved, the interpositives and internegatives are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The original camera negatives is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost.

The more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the original camera negative to strike new interpositives to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more internegatives and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.{{Citation needed|reason=Oh really? I can imagine that prints from the early years of film were struck directly off the original negative, but I seriously doubt this continued through the Golden Age and as late as 1969. --Retro00064|date=June 2013}}

== Digital cameras ==
Physical [[film stock]] is still occasionally used in film-making, particularly in prestige productions where the director and cinematographer have the power to require the extra cost, but as of 2016, it is becoming increasingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1503-Summer-2015/Industry-Film-is-Dead.aspx|title=Christopher Nolan fights to keep film alive|last=Hart|first=Hugh|date=Summer 2015|website=www.dga.org|publisher=Directors Guild of America|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern cinematography, the camera is usually a [[digital camera]], and no physical negative exists. However, the concept of "camera original material" is still used to describe camera image data. Camera original material that has not yet been ingested, duplicated, and archived is in a similar precarious state to original camera negative in a film process. One of the jobs of the [[digital imaging technician]] is to ensure that digital camera original material is backed up as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7883">The '''Pollyanna principle''' (also called '''Pollyannaism''' or '''positivity bias''') is the tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978|p=260}} Research{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} indicates that at the subconscious level, the mind has a tendency to focus on the optimistic; while at the conscious level, it has a tendency to focus on the negative. This subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle and is similar to the [[Forer effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf Forer BR (1949).

==Development==
The name derives from the 1913 novel ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] describing a girl who plays the "glad game"—trying to find something to be glad about in every situation. The novel has been adapted to film several times, most famously in [[Pollyanna (1920 film)|1920]] and [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|1960]]. An early use of the name "Pollyanna" in psychological literature was in 1969 by Boucher and Osgood who described a ''Pollyanna hypothesis'' as a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating.{{sfn|Boucher|Osgood|1969}} Empirical evidence for this tendency has been provided by computational analyses of large corpora of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Peter Sheridan|last2=Clark|first2=Eric M.|last3=Desu|first3=Suma|last4=Frank|first4=Morgan R.|last5=Reagan|first5=Andrew J.|last6=Williams|first6=Jake Ryland|last7=Mitchell|first7=Lewis|last8=Harris|first8=Kameron Decker|last9=Kloumann|first9=Isabel M.|date=2015-02-24|title=Human language reveals a universal positivity bias|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/2389|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=8|pages=2389–2394|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411678112|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25675475|pmc=4345622|arxiv=1406.3855|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.2389D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtz|first=Peter|last2=Deutschmann|first2=Emanuel|last3=Dobewall|first3=Henrik|date=2017-08-23|title=Cross-Cultural Psychology and the Rise of Academic Capitalism: Linguistic Changes in CCR and JCCP Articles, 1970-2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022117724902|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1410–1431|doi=10.1177/0022022117724902|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pollyanna principle'' was described by Matlin and Stang in 1978 using the [[archetype]] of Pollyanna more specifically as a psychological principle which portrays the [[nostalgia|positive bias people have when thinking of the past]]. According to the Pollyanna Principle, the brain processes information that is pleasing and agreeable in a more precise and exact manner as compared to unpleasant information. We actually tend to remember past experiences as more rosy than they actually occurred.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978}}

Researchers Margaret Matlin and David Stang provided substantial evidence of the Pollyanna Principle. They found that people expose themselves to positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli, they take longer to recognize what is unpleasant or threatening than what is pleasant and safe, and they report that they encounter positive stimuli more frequently than they actually do. Matlin and Stang also determined that selective recall was a more likely occurrence when recall was delayed: the longer the delay, the more selective recall that occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Pollyanna principle has been observed on online social networks as well. For example, [[Twitter]] users preferentially share more, and are emotionally affected more frequently by, positive information.{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015a}}{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015b}}

However, the Pollyanna principle does not always apply to individuals suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], who tend to either have more [[depressive realism]] or a negative bias.{{sfn|Carr|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12519">The '''principle of transformation groups''' is a rule for assigning ''epistemic'' probabilities in a statistical inference problem.  It was first suggested by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Edwin T. Jaynes]] &lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen as a generalisation of the [[principle of indifference]].

This can be seen as a method to create ''objective ignorance probabilities'' in the sense that two people who apply the principle and are confronted with the same information will assign the same probabilities.

== Motivation and description of the method ==
The method is motivated by the following normative principle, or desideratum:

''In two problems where we have the same prior information we should assign the same prior probabilities''

The method then comes about from "transforming" a given problem into an equivalent one.  This method has close connections with [[group theory]], and to a large extent is about finding symmetry in a given problem, and then exploiting this symmetry to assign prior probabilities.

In problems with discrete variables (e.g. dice, cards, categorical data) the principle reduces to the [[principle of indifference]], as the "symmetry" in the discrete case is a permutation of the labels, that is the [[permutation group]] is the relevant transformation group for this problem.

In problems with continuous variables, this method generally reduces to solving a [[differential equation]].  Given that differential equations do not always lead to unique solutions, this method cannot be guaranteed to produce a unique solution.  However, in a large class of the most common types of parameters it does lead to unique solutions (see the examples below)

== Examples ==
=== Discrete Case - coin flipping ===
Consider a problem where all you are told is that there is a coin, and it has a head (H) and a tail (T).  Denote this information by ''I''.  You are then asked "what is the probability of Heads?".  Call this ''problem 1'' and denote the probability ''P(H|I)''.  Consider another question "what is the probability of Tails?".  Call this ''problem 2'' and denote this probability by ''P(T|I)''.

Now from the information which was actually in the question, there is no distinction between heads and tails.  The whole paragraph above could be re-written with "Heads" and "Tails" interchanged, and "H" and "T" interchanged, and the problem statement would not be any different.  Using the desideratum then demands that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)=P(T|I)&lt;/math&gt;

The probabilities must add to 1, this means that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)+P(T|I)=1 \rightarrow 2 P(H|I)=1 \rightarrow P(H|I)=0.5 &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we have a unique solution.  This argument easily extents to ''N'' categories, to give the "flat" prior probability ''1/N''.
This provides a ''consistency'' based argument to the principle of indifference which goes as follows: ''if someone is truly ignorant about a discrete/countable set of outcomes apart from their potential existence, but does not assign them equal prior probabilities, then they are assigning different probabilities when given the same information''.

This can be alternatively phrased as: ''a person who does not use the principle of indifference to assign prior probabilities to discrete variables, is either not ignorant about them, or reasoning inconsistently''.

===Continuous Case - location parameter===

This is the easiest example for continuous variables.  It is given by stating one is "ignorant" of the location parameter in a given problem.  The statement that a parameter is a "location parameter" is that the sampling distribution, or likelihood of an observation ''X'' depends on a parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only through the difference

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

for some normalised, but otherwise arbitrary distribution ''f(.)''.  Examples of location parameters include mean parameter of [[normal distribution]] with known variance and median parameter of [[Cauchy distribution]] with known inter-quartile range.
The two "equivalent problems" in this case, given ones knowledge of the sampling distribution &lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, but no other knowledge about &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is simply given by a "shift" of equal magnitude in ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because of the relation:

&lt;math&gt; f(X-\mu)=f([X+b]-[\mu+b])=f(X^{(1)}-\mu^{(1)}) &lt;/math&gt;

So simply "shifting" all quantities up by some number ''b'' and solving in the "shifted space" and then "shifting" back to the original one should give exactly the same answer as if we just worked on the original space.  Making the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mu^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of simply 1, and so the prior probability &lt;math&gt;g(\mu) = p(\mu|I)&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the functional equation:

&lt;math&gt;g(\mu)=\left|{\partial \mu^{(1)} \over \partial \mu}\right| g(\mu^{(1)}) = g(\mu+b)&lt;/math&gt;

And the only function which satisfies this equation is the "constant prior":

&lt;math&gt;p(\mu|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the uniform prior is justified for expressing complete ignorance of a location parameter.

===Continuous case - scale parameter===

As in the above argument, a statement that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a scale parameter means that the sampling distribution has the functional form:

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\sigma,I)={1 \over \sigma}f\left({X \over \sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, as before ''f(.)'' is a normalised probability density function.  The requirement that probabilities be finite and positive forces the condition &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Examples include the standard deviation of a normal distribution with known mean, the [[gamma distribution]].  The "symmetry" in this problem is found by noting that

&lt;math&gt;{X \over \sigma}={X a \over \sigma a} ; a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

But, unlike in the location parameter case, the Jacobian of this transformation in the sample space and the parameter space is ''a'', not 1.  so the [[sampling probability]] changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(X^{(1)}|\sigma,I)={1 \over a} \cdot {1 \over \sigma}f\left({X a \over \sigma a}\right)= {1 \over \sigma^{(1)}}f\left({X^{(1)} \over \sigma^{(1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is invariant (i.e. has the same form before and after the transformation), and the prior probability changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I)={1 \over a} p(\sigma^{(1)}|I)={1 \over a}p\left({\sigma \over a}|I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which has the unique solution (up to a proportionality constant):

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I) \propto {1 \over \sigma} \rightarrow p(\log(\sigma)|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the well-known [[Jeffreys prior]] for scale parameters, which is "flat" on the log scale, although it should be noted that it is derived using a different argument to that here, based on the [[Fisher information]] function.  The fact that these two methods give the same results in this case does not imply it in general.

===Continuous case - Bertrand's paradox===
Edwin Jaynes used this principle to provide a resolution to [[Bertrand paradox (probability)|Bertrand's Paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/well.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
by stating his ignorance about the exact position of the circle.  The details are available in the reference or in the link.

== Discussion ==

This argument depends crucially on ''I''; changing the information may result in a different probability assignment.  It is just as crucial as changing [[axioms]] in [[deductive logic]] - small changes in the information can lead to large changes in the probability assignments allowed by "consistent reasoning".

To illustrate suppose that the coin flipping example also states as part of the information that the coin has a side (S) (i.e. it is a ''real coin'').  Denote this new information by ''N''.  The same argument using "complete ignorance", or more precisely, the information actually described, gives:

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I,N)=P(T|I,N)=P(S|I,N)=1/3 &lt;/math&gt;

But this seems absurd to most people - intuition tells us that we should have P(S) very close to zero.  This is because most people's intuition do not see "symmetry" between a coin landing on its side compared to landing on heads.  Our intuition says that the particular "labels" actually carry some information about the problem.  A simple argument could be used to make this more formal mathematically (e.g. the physics of the problem make it difficult for a flipped coin to land on its side) - we make a distinction between "thick" coins and "thin" coins [here thickness is measured relative to the coin's diameter].  It could reasonably be assumed that:

&lt;math&gt;P(S|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(S|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this new information probably wouldn't break the symmetry between "heads" and "tails", so ''that'' permutation would still apply in describing "equivalent problems", and we would require:

&lt;math&gt;P(T|\text{thin coin}) = P(H|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(H|\text{thick coin})=P(T|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

This is a good example of how the principle of transformation groups can be used to "flesh out" personal opinions.  All of the information used in the derivation is explicitly stated.  If a prior probability assignment doesn't "seem right" according to what your intuition tells you, then there must be some "background information" which has not been put into the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is then the task to try and work out what that information is.  In some sense, by combining the method of transformation groups with one's intuition can be used to "weed out" the actual assumptions one has.  This makes it a very powerful tool for prior elicitation.

Introducing the thickness of the coin is permissible because it was not specified in the problem, so this is still only using information in the question{{Huh|date=December 2017}}. Introducing a "nuisance parameter" and then making the answer invariant to this parameter is a very useful technique for solving supposedly "ill-posed" problems like Bertrand's Paradox.  This has been called "the well-posing strategy" by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/519028 |jstor=519028 |title=Bertrand's Paradox and the Principle of Indifference |year=2007 |last1=Shackel |first1=Nicholas |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=150|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/3803/1/Shackel%20Bertrand%27s%20paradox%205.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real power of this principle lies in its application to continuous parameters, where the notion of "complete ignorance" is not so well defined as in the discrete case.  However, if applied with infinite limits, it often gives [[improper prior]] distributions.  Note that the discrete case for a countably infinite set, such as (0,1,2,...) also produces an improper discrete prior.  For most cases where the likelihood is sufficiently "steep" this does not present a problem.  However, in order to be absolutely sure to avoid incoherent results and paradoxes, the prior distribution should be approached via a well defined and well behaved limiting process.  One such process is the use of a sequence of priors with increasing range, such as &lt;math&gt;f(M) = {I(M \in [-b,b]) \over 2b}&lt;/math&gt; where the limit &lt;math&gt;b \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken ''at the end of the calculation'' i.e. after the normalisation of the posterior distribution.  What this effectively is doing, is ensuring that one is taking the limit of the ratio, and not the ratio of two limits.  See [[Limit of a function#Properties]] for details on limits and why this order of operations is important.

If the limit of the ratio does not exist or diverges, then this gives an improper posterior (i.e. a posterior which does not integrate to one).  This indicates that the data are so uninformative about the parameters that the prior probability of arbitrarily large values still matters in the final answer.  In some sense, an improper posterior means that the information contained in the data has not "ruled out" arbitrarily large values.  Looking at the improper priors this way, it seems to make some sense that "complete ignorance" priors should be improper, because the information used to derive them is so meager that it cannot rule out absurd values on its own.  From a state of complete ignorance, only the data or some other form of additional information can rule out such absurdities.

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447–8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268–285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333–359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15–17 Sept 1997 |pages=18–36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond – a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115–39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985–1986 |volume=21 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K.

M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110–130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136–149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253–300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''self-model''' is the central concept in the theory of [[consciousness]] called the '''self-model theory of subjectivity''' ('''SMT'''). This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of [[consciousness]] and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR).&lt;ref name="pmid18166398"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzinger T. |title=Empirical perspectives from the self-model theory of subjectivity: a brief summary with examples |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=168 |pages=215–45 |year=2008 |pmid=18166398 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)68018-2 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-53050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Metzinger]] advanced the theory in his 1993 book ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell'' (Subject and self-model).&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1993). ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell''. Paderborn: Schoningh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the PSM==
The PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership.&lt;ref name="Being No One"&gt;Being No One&lt;/ref&gt; The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Being No one&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves.  These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.

==Role of the prefrontal cortex==
The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the [[parietal lobe]]s, unity and the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10487788"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogeley K. |author2=Kurthen M. |author3=Falkai P. |author4=Maier W. |title=Essential functions of the human self model are implemented in the prefrontal cortex |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–63 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10487788 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to psychopathology==
Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[depersonalization]]. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to [[theory of mind]] deficits and [[weak central coherence theory]]. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in [[narcissism]].&lt;ref name="pmid10993669"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ben Shalom D |title=Developmental depersonalization: the prefrontal cortex and self-functions in autism |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=457–60 |date=September 2000 |pmid =10993669 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2000.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E.

Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

'''Threatcasting''' is a conceptual framework used to help multidisciplinary groups envision future scenarios. It is also a process that enables systematic planning against threats ten years in the future. Utilizing the threatcasting process, groups explore possible future threats and how to transform the future they desire into reality while avoiding undesired futures. Threatcasting is a continuous, multiple-step process with inputs from social science, technical research, cultural history, economics, trends, expert interviews, and science fiction storytelling. These inputs inform the exploration of potential visions of the future.

Once inputs are explored for impact and application, participants create a science fiction story ([[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]]) based ten years in the future to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about a person in a place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working toward the ten year future scenario. These actions will help participants understand how to empower or disrupt the target future scenario. Flags (warning events) are also determined in order to map societal indicators onto the recommended path toward the targeted future. When identified flags appear in society, threatcasting participants map these back to the original forecast to see whether or not they are on track toward the target future scenario.

== Origins ==
{{see also|Science fiction prototyping}}

The notion of threatcasting can be traced back to Brian David Johnson, an applied futurist, who first began using threatcasting, also referred to as futurecasting, in 2011 and to George Hemingway of the Stratalis Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/MMStratalisFuturecasting1.pdf|title=Futurecasting the Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=January 2013|website=Stratalis Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who pioneered notion of futurecasting for corporate strategy and innovation industrial markets, including mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/futurecasting-the-power-of-foresight/|title=The Stratalis Group {{!}}   Futurecasting: The Power of Foresight – The Final in a Six Part Series|website=www.stratalisgroup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. Early adopters of threatcasting include the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Government of California]], and the Army Cyber Institute at [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]]. Official use of the term threatcasting is attributed to Brian David Johnson in a 2014 Gazette article “Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/drones-smart-hydrants-considered-by-experts-looking-at-future-of-firefighting/article/1515148|title=Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between Threatcasting and Strategic Planning ==
Threatcasting is fundamentally different from traditional [[strategic planning]] and [[Scenario analysis|scenario building]] processes due to the identification of specific actions, indicators and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate and recover from future threats.

== Applications ==
The Army Cyber Institute at West Point in conjunction with [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Arizona State University's]] Global Securities Initiative and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society have established a Threatcasting Lab to host and manage a Cyber Threatcasting Project which looks to envision future cyber threats ten years in the future. The first session of this collaborative group was held at West Point, NY in August 2016.

The '''vicious circle principle''' is a principle that was endorsed by many [[impredicativity|predicativist]] mathematicians in the early 20th century to prevent contradictions.  The principle states that no object or property may be introduced by a definition that depends on that object or property itself.  In addition to ruling out definitions that are explicitly circular (like "an object has property P [[iff]] it is not next to anything that has property P"), this principle rules out definitions that quantify over domains which include the entity being defined.  Thus, it blocks [[Russell's paradox]], which defines a set S that contains all sets that don't contain themselves.  This definition is blocked because it defines a new set in terms of the totality of all sets, of which this new set would itself be a member.

However, it also blocks one standard definition of the [[natural numbers]].  First, we define a property as being "[[hereditary]]" if, whenever a number ''n'' has the property, so does ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Then we say that ''x'' has the property of being a natural number [[iff|if and ''only'' if]] it has every hereditary property that 0 has.  This definition is blocked, because it defines "natural number" in terms of the totality of all hereditary properties, but "natural number" itself would be such a hereditary property, so the definition is circular in this sense.

Most modern mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics think that this particular definition is not circular in any problematic sense, and thus they reject the vicious circle principle.  But it was endorsed by many early 20th century researchers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Henri Poincaré]].  On the other hand, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] accepted the ban on explicit circularity, but argued against the ban on circular quantification.  After all, the definition "let T be the tallest man in the room" defines T by means of quantification over a domain (men in the room) of which T is a member.  But this is not problematic, they suggest, because the definition doesn't actually create the person, but merely shows how to pick him out of the totality.  Similarly, they suggest, definitions don't actually create sets or properties or objects, but rather just give one way of picking out the already existing entity from the collection of which it is a part.  Thus, this sort of circularity in terms of quantification can't cause any problems.

This principle was the reason for Russell's development of the [[System of types#The 1908 .22ramified.22 theory of types|ramified theory of types]] rather than the [[History of type theory#Theory of simple types|theory of simple types]].  (See "Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles".&lt;ref name="SEP001"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “all propositions are either true or false.” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “all propositions” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “all propositions.” We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “all propositions” are meaningless.… The principle which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as follows: “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection”; or, conversely: “If, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said collection has no total.” We shall call this the “vicious-circle principle,” because it enables us to avoid the vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate totalities. (Whitehead and Russell 1910, 37) (quoted in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ Russell's Paradox])

A '''world view'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/world-view|title=world-view noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''worldview''' is the fundamental [[cognitive]] orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual's or society's knowledge and [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[calque]] of the German word '''''[[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]''''' {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʔanˌʃaʊ.ʊŋ||De-Weltanschauung.ogg}}, composed of ''[[wikt:Welt|Welt]]'' ('world') and ''[[wikt:Anschauung|Anschauung]]'' ('view' or 'outlook').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=worldview |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word is also used in English.

It is a concept fundamental to [[German philosophy]] and [[epistemology]] and refers to a ''wide world perception''. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

Worldview remains a confused and confusing concept in English, used very differently by [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]]. It is for this reason that James W. Underhill suggests five subcategories: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective&lt;ref name =Underhill_2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Humboldt, Worldview and Language|date=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748638420|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Creating worldviews : metaphor, ideology and language|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748679096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107532847}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to  articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "[[figure and ground (media)|ground]]" in [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[Media (communication)|media analysis]]. However, core worldview beliefs are often deeply rooted, and so are only rarely reflected on by individuals, and are brought to the surface only in moments of crises of faith.

==Origins==

===Linguistics===
The [[Prussia]]n [[philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) originated the idea that language and worldview are inextricable. Humboldt saw language as part of the creative adventure of mankind. Culture, language and linguistic communities developed simultaneously and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to [[linguistic determinism]], which invites us to consider language as a constraint, a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1884–1939) also gives an account of the relationship between thinking and speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fadul |first= Jose |date= 2014 |title= Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling |url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WRrzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Edward+Sapir+also+gives+an+account+of+the+relationship+between+thinking+and+speaking+in+English&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ObjouuV9rd&amp;sig=RdD1S6ILO_XYWERUl0fB48KL5xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwictcjAoJTRAhVIpI8KHbCdDk4Q6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Sapir%20also%20gives%20an%20account%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20thinking%20and%20speaking%20in%20English&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= 347 |isbn= 978-1-312-34920-9 |author-link= | quote = Edward Sapir also gives an account of the significant relationship between thinking and speaking in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistic relativity]] [[hypothesis]] of [[Benjamin Whorf|Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1897–1941) describes how the syntactic-semantic structure of a language becomes an underlying structure for the world view or ''Weltanschauung'' of a people through the organization of the causal [[perception]] of the world and the linguistic [[categorization]] of entities. As linguistic categorization emerges as a representation of worldview and causality, it further modifies social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between [[language]] and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 679389 |pages= 65–79 |last1= Kay |first1= P. |last2= Kempton |first2= W. |title= What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis? |volume= 86 |issue= 1 |journal= American Anthropologist |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's hypothesis became influential in the late 1940s, but declined in prominence after a decade. In the 1990s, new research gave further support for the linguistic relativity theory in the works of [[Stephen Levinson]] (1947–) and his team at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck institute]] for [[psycholinguistics]] at [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory has also gained attention through the work of [[Lera Boroditsky]] at Stanford University.

===''Weltanschauung'' and cognitive philosophy===

One of the most important concepts in cognitive [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive sciences]] is the German concept of ''Weltanschauung''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This expression has often been used to refer to the "wide worldview" or "wide world perception" of a people, family, or person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The ''Weltanschauung'' of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}The [[language]] of a people reflects the ''Weltanschauung'' of that people in the form of its [[Syntax|syntactic structures]] and untranslatable [[connotation]]s and its [[denotation]]s.

The term ''Weltanschauung'' is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, as Jürgen Trabant points out, and as James W. Underhill reminds us, Humboldt's key concept was ''Weltansicht''.&lt;ref name=Underhill_2009/&gt; ''Weltansicht'' was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, ''Weltanschauung'', first used by Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

A worldview can be expressed as the "fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, Paul G. Transforming Worldviews: an anthropological understanding of how people change. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If it were possible to draw a [[map]] of the [[world]] on the basis of ''Weltanschauung'',&lt;ref name="Whorf" &gt;{{cite book|author-last=Whorf|author-first=Benjamin Lee|author-link=Benjamin Lee Whorf|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=John Bissell|editor-link=John Bissell Carroll|origyear=1st pub. 1956 |year=1964|title=Language, Thought, and Reality.

If the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is correct, the worldview map of the world would be similar to the linguistic map of the world. However, it would also almost coincide with a map of the world drawn on the basis of [[music]] across people.&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt;

===Folk-epics===
{{See also|List of world folk-epics}}

As natural language becomes manifestations of world [[perception]], the [[literature]] of a people with common ''Weltanschauung'' emerges as holistic [[representation (psychology)|representations]] of the wide world perception of the people. Thus the extent and commonality between world folk-epics becomes a manifestation of the commonality and extent of a worldview.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Epic poems]] are shared often by people across political borders and across generations. Examples of such epics include the [[Nibelungenlied]] of the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] people, the [[Iliad]] for the Ancient Greeks and Hellenized societies, the [[Silappadhikaram]] of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] of the Hindus, the [[Gilgamesh]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]n-[[Sumer]]ian [[civilization]] and the people of the [[Fertile Crescent]] at large, [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian nights) of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]] epic of the [[Mandé]] people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Terror management theory===
{{Main article|Terror management theory}}
A worldview, according to [[terror management theory]] (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety.&lt;ref name="worm"&gt;Schimel, J., Hayes, J., Williams, T., &amp; Jahrig, J. (2007).

''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 92, No. 5'', pp. 789-803.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that living up to the ideals of one's worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality, symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one's death, or in contributions to one's culture).&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Using a test of [[Terror management theory#Death thought accessibility|death-thought accessibility]] (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. "COFF__" could either be completed as either "COFFEE" or "COFFIN" or "COFFER"), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one's cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel ''et al'' conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Goldenberg ''et al'' found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., Cox, C. R., Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., &amp; Solomon, S. (2002). ''Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning.'' Journal of Sex Research, 39, 310–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The term World View denotes a comprehensive set of opinions, seen as an [[organic unity]], about the world as the medium and exercise of human existence. World View serves as a framework for generating various dimensions of human perception and experience like [[knowledge]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[culture]], [[science]] and [[ethics]]. For example, worldview of [[causality]] as ''uni-directional'', ''cyclic'', or ''spiral'' generates a framework of the world that reflects these systems of causality.

===Causality===
An unidirectional view of [[causality]] is present in some monotheistic views of the world with a beginning and an end and a single great force with a single end (e.g., [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), while a cyclic worldview of causality is present in religious traditions which are cyclic and seasonal and wherein events and experiences recur in systematic patterns (e.g., [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Hinduism]]). These worldviews of causality not only underlie religious traditions but also other aspects of thought like the purpose of [[history]], [[politics|political]] and [[economics|economic]] theories, and systems like [[democracy]], [[authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

The worldview of a [[linear]] and [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] causality generates various related/conflicting disciplines and approaches in [[scientific thinking]]. The ''Weltanschauung'' of the temporal contiguity of act and event leads to underlying diversifications like ''determinism'' vs. ''free will''. A worldview of [[free will]] leads to disciplines that are governed by simple laws that remain constant and are static and [[empirical]] in scientific method, while a worldview of [[determinism]] generates disciplines that are governed with [[dynamical systems|generative systems]] and [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] in [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] and [[materialism]] reject the validity of entities inaccessible to [[natural science]]. They view the [[scientific method]] as the most reliable model for [[model (abstract)|building]] an [[understanding]] of the [[world]].

==Religion==
[[Nishida Kitaro]] wrote extensively on "the Religious Worldview" in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed Kitaro's final book is ''Last Writings: Nothingness and the Religious Worldview''
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neo-Calvinist]] [[David Naugle]]'s ''World view: The History of a Concept'', "Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church."&lt;ref&gt;David K. Naugle ''Worldview: The History of a Concept'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4761-7}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian thinker [[James W. Sire]] defines a worldview as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." He suggests that "we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sire ''The Universe Next Door: A Basic World view Catalog'' p15–16 (text readable at Amazon.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person's view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the 'Emancipatory Worldview' in his writing "History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9631989/History_of_emancipatory_worldview_of_Muslim_learners|title=History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question mentioned above - on whether the super-smart machines, that is, any ''[[Superintelligence|superintelligences]]'', as expected by some, could have worldviews - is interesting in this context and this would influence human worldviews. 

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Belief system}}

The philosophical importance of worldviews became increasingly clear during the 20th century for a number of reasons, such as increasing contact between cultures, and the failure of some aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, such as the [[rationalist]] project of attaining all truth by reason alone. [[Mathematical logic]] showed that fundamental choices of [[axioms]] were essential in deductive reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Not just in the obvious sense that you need axioms to prove anything, but the fact that for example the [[Axiom of choice]] and [[Axiom S5]], although widely regarded as correct, were in some sense optional.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, even having chosen axioms not everything that was true in a given [[logical system]] could be proven.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]] and discussion in e.g. [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]'s ''The Freedom of the Will''&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe the problems extend to "the inconsistencies and failures which plagued the Enlightenment attempt to identify universal moral and rational principles";&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Alister McGrath]] in ''[[The Science of God]]'' p 109 citing in particular [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' – he also cites [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Enlightenment principles such as [[universal suffrage]] and the [[universal declaration of human rights]] are accepted, if not taken for granted, by many.&lt;ref&gt;"Governments in a democracy do not grant the fundamental freedoms enumerated by Jefferson; governments are created to protect those freedoms that every individual possesses by virtue of his or her existence. In their formulation by the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, inalienable rights are God-given natural rights. These rights are not destroyed when civil society is created, and neither society nor government can remove or "alienate" them."[http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm US Gov website on democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190718/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of relativity]] offers a Weltanschauung that is revolting to [[absolute space and time]], yet provides a context for modern theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]]. In a book review for a new undergraduate textbook on relativity by [[Wolfgang Rindler]], Kenneth Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobs (1970) "Bridging the gap between relativity and the undergraduate", [[Physics Today]] 23(12):48,8 {{doi|10.1063/1.3021868}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "during the post-[[Sputnik]] era, [[special relativity]] began to take its rightful place in the undergraduate curriculum". On the adoption of the Weltanschauung, he notes, "The historical impact of any world picture is ... partly attributable to the zeal of the promulgators and to the efficacy of their teachings."

Philosophers also distinguish the manifest image from the scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest ([[sc.]] obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it have to be that way?&lt;ref&gt;see Owen Flanagan's 'The Problem of the Soul', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will,&lt;ref&gt;see especially Daniel Dennett's 'Freedom Evolves', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the self and individuality, and the possibility of real or lived meaning.

== Characteristics ==
While [[Leo Apostel]] and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a [[community]] level, or in an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] way. For instance, if one's worldview is fixed by one's language, as according to a strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994) "[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration]" VUB Press. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel.&lt;/ref&gt; a worldview is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An [[explanation]] of the world
# A [[futurology]], answering the question "Where are we heading?"
# Values, answers to [[ethical]] questions: "What should we do?"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]]: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]: "What is [[truth|true]] and false?"
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.

== Classification of cultural worldviews ==
From across the world across all of the cultures, Roland Muller has suggested that cultural world views can be broken down into three separate world views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Muller
| first = Roland
| publisher = Xlibris; 1st edition
| year = 2001

| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not simple enough to say that each person is one of these three cultures. Instead, each individual is a mix of the three. For example, a person may be raised in a Power–Fear society, in an Honor–Shame family, and go to school under a Guilt–Innocence system.

=== Guilt–Innocence ===
In a Guilt–Innocence focused culture, schools focus on deductive reasoning, cause and effect, good questions, and process. Issues are often seen as black and white. Written contracts are paramount. Communication is direct, and can be blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Three Colors of Worldview
| website = KnowledgeWorkx
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor–Shame ===
Societies with a predominantly Honor–Shame worldview teach children to make honorable choices according to the situations they find themselves in. Communication, interpersonal interaction, and business dealings are very relationship-driven, with every interaction having an effect on the Honor–Shame status of the participants. In an Honor–Shame society the crucial objective is to avoid shame and to be viewed honorably by other people. The Honor–Shame paradigm is especially strong in most regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| location = 
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power–Fear ===
Some cultures can be seen very clearly in operating under a Power–Fear worldview. In these cultures it is very important to assess the people around you and know where they fall in line according to their level of power. This can be used for good or for bad. A benevolent king rules with power and his citizens fully support him wielding that power. On the converse, a ruthless dictator can use his power to create a [[culture of fear]] where his citizens are oppressed.

==Streams in contemporary American thought==

According to [[Michael Lind]], "a worldview is a more or less coherent understanding of the nature of reality, which permits its holders to interpret new information in light of their preconceptions. Clashes among worldviews cannot be ended by a simple appeal to facts. Even if rival sides agree on the facts, people may disagree on conclusions because of their different premises." This is why politicians often seem to talk past one another, or ascribe different meanings to the same events. Tribal or national wars are often the result of incompatible worldviews. Lind has organized American political worldviews into five categories:
* [[Green politics|Green]] [[Malthusianism]] synthesizes mystical versions of [[environmentalism]] with alarm about population growth in the tradition of the Rev. Thomas Malthus
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[Isolationism]] would abandon foreign alliances, dismantle most of its military, and return to a 19th-century pattern of decentralized government and an economy based on small businesses and small farms.
* [[Neoliberal]] [[Globalism]] believes that at home governments should provide only basic public goods like infrastructure and security, and do so by market-friendly methods
* [[populism|Populist]] [[Nationalism]] tends to favor restriction of legal as well as illegal [[immigration]] to protect the core stock of the tribe-state from dilution by different races, ethnic groups or religions. Populist nationalism also tends to favor [[protectionist]] policies that shield workers and businesses, particularly small businesses, from foreign competition.
* [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] claims an economic safety net, protecting citizens from unemployment, sickness, poverty in old age and other disasters, is necessary if democratic government is to retain popular support.
Lind argues that even though not all people will fit neatly into only one category or the other, their core worldview shape how they frame their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Lind |title=The five worldviews that define American politics |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/12/lind_five_worldviews/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon Magazine]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and comparison==
One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of [[basic belief]]s which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview precisely because they are [[axiom]]s, and are typically argued ''from'' rather than argued ''for''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Daniel Hill and Randal Rauser ''Christian Philosophy A–Z'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2152-1}} p200&lt;/ref&gt; However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.&lt;ref&gt;In the Christian tradition this goes back at least to [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogues with Trypho, A Jew'', and has roots in the debates recorded in the [[New Testament]] For a discussion of the long history of religious dialogue in India, see [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''The Argumentative Indian''
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of [[cultural relativism]] and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from [[philosophical realist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5 ''Cognitive Relativism'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices.[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on Relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only "true for them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49207 Pope Benedict warns against relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Ratzinger, J. ''Relativism, the Central Problem for Faith Today'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subjective logic]] is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=9|issue=3|pages=279–311|doi=10.1142/S0218488501000831|last1=Jøsang|first1=Audun|title=A Logic For Uncertain Probabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher [[Ninian Smart]] begins his ''Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs'' with "Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews" and argues for "the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ninian Smart]] ''Worldviews: Crosscultural Explorations of Human Beliefs (3rd Edition)'' {{ISBN|0-13-020980-5}} p14
&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different [[presupposition]]s and cognitive values. Clément Vidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x|author=Vidal, Clément}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# ''objective'': objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# ''subjective'': subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# ''intersubjective'': intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

David Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962016344|title=SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND WORLD VIEWS.|last=BELL|first=DAVID|date=2016|publisher=GROSVENOR House PUBLISHING|isbn=9781786237668|location=Guildford, Surrey, UK|oclc=962016344}}&lt;/ref&gt; has raised interesting questions on worldviews for the designers of [[Superintelligence|superintelligences]] – machines much smarter than humans. &amp;nbsp;'Would they need worldviews, where would they get their worldviews and what would they be like?'. The answers would have to relate to, for example, Christian worldviews. Some of the people who consider features of superintelligences say they will have characteristics that are often associated with divinity, raising big open questions for Christian believers. For example, very advanced machines could, perhaps, &amp;nbsp; ultimately engender in people a terrified reverence and mystical awe in the light of, say, an artificial agent's impressive understanding of the human condition. And perhaps some humans might even be induced to 'worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator'? On the other hand what would the agent's relationship to God be? Anyone attempting to accommodate concepts such as an omnipotent, personal creator's sacrificial, emotional, spiritual and attitudinal demands being made of any man-made entity, superintelligent or not, could be said to have strayed into ''terra prohibita'' theologically, of course. And how would the worldviews of any superintelligences handle the relationships with what it might regard as its ''human'' 'creator'?
