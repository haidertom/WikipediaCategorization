'''''The British [[DXing|DX]] Club''''' (abbreviated form "BDXC") is an association of radio hobbyists, based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It caters mainly for, though not exclusively, [[DXing|DX]]ers and [[Short Wave]] listeners. It was founded in 1974 and was originally known as the "[[Twickenham]] DX Club" (after the [[Middlesex]], [[UK]], town where it was originally based), but re-launched in 1979 as the British DX Club. The name change was made to reflect its growing national and international membership which currently stands at around 500.  To distinguish it from similar organisations in other countries, the club's abbreviated name for international use is BDXC-UK.

BDXC publishes a monthly magazine "Communication", which is registered with the [[British Library]] (ISSN 0958-2142). The main contents of a typical magazine consist of a mixture of [[DXing|DX]] "loggings", details of radio station frequencies and programmes, letters and articles of general interest on [[broadcasting]] topics. These topics include:

UK News, [[The Web|Webwatch]], DX News, [[Radio propagation|Propagation]], [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] News, Mediumwave Report, Collectors Corner ([[vintage Radio]]'s etc.), The Audio Circle, Beyond The Horizon,  [[Mediumwave]] Logbook, [[Shortwave|Tropical]] Logbook, [[High frequency|HF]] Logbook, Alternative Airwaves ([[Pirate Radio]]), and members contributions.

In 1976, the club launched a monthly audio magazine on [[cassette tape]], BDXC Audio Circle (formerly known as BDXC Tape Circle). This is now also distributed on [[Compact Disc]] and as an [[MP3]] [[downloadable]] file for subscribing members only.

The BDXC also has an [[email]] news group for club members to distribute news and DX 'catches' to subscribed members.  The Audio Circle also has its own email group.

BDXC and its members are important contributors to each  edition of the World Radio Television Handbook ([[World Radio TV Handbook|WRTH]]) an annual publication listing broadcasting times and frequencies of most of the world's national and international broadcasters. Information on other UK DX clubs is also included in WRTH.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Garry Davis]] (Peace activist who created the first "World Passport)
:[[Albert Einstein]] ("The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people.")
:[[George Monbiot]] ("A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves")&lt;ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17784">'''Discrete logarithm records''' are the best results achieved to date in solving the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, which is the problem of finding solutions ''x'' to the equation ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h'' given elements ''g'' and ''h'' of a finite [[cyclic group]]&amp;nbsp;''G''.  The difficulty of this problem is the basis for the security of several [[cryptographic]] systems, including [[Diffie–Hellman]] key agreement, [[ElGamal encryption]], the [[ElGamal signature scheme]], the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]], and the [[elliptic curve cryptography]] analogs of these.  Common choices for ''G'' used in these algorithms include the multiplicative group of integers modulo&amp;nbsp;''p'', the multiplicative group of a [[finite field]], and the group of points on an [[elliptic curve]] over a [[finite field]].

==Integers modulo ''p''==

On 16 June 2016, Thorsten Kleinjung, Claus Diem, [[Arjen K. Lenstra]], Christine Priplata, and Colin Stahlke announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 232-digit (768-bit) [[safe prime]], using the number field sieve.  The computation was started in February 2015 and took approximately 6600 core years scaled to an Intel Xeon E5-2660 at 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;a0c66b63.1606 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 768 bits,”] June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records for integers modulo ''p'' include:

* On 18 June 2005, [[Antoine Joux]] and Reynald Lercier announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 130-digit (431-bit) [[strong prime]] in  three weeks, using a 1.15&amp;nbsp;GHz 16-processor HP [[AlphaServer GS1280]] computer and a [[number field sieve]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0506&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=20 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 130 digits,”] June 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 5 February 2007 this was superseded by the announcement by Thorsten Kleinjung of the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 160-digit (530-bit) [[safe prime]], again using the number field sieve.  Most of the computation was done using idle time on various PCs and on a parallel computing cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0702&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;P=R45&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;T=0 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 160 digits,”] February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 June 2014, Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel Thomé announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 180 digit (596-bit) safe prime using the number field sieve algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel
Thomé, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1406&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3161 "Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 180 digits"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite fields==

The current record ({{As of|2014|1|alt=as of January 2014}}) in a finite field of characteristic 2 was announced by Robert Granger, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel on 31 January 2014.  This team was able to compute discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;9234&lt;/sup&gt;) using about 400,000 core hours.  New features of this computation include a modified method for obtaining the logarithms of degree two elements and a systematically optimized descent strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Zumbrägel, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^9234)", 31 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;9aa2b043.1401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records in a finite field of characteristic 2 were announced by:

* Antoine Joux on 21 May 2013.  His team was able to compute discrete logarithms in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt; = (2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; elements using less than 550 CPU-hours. This computation was performed using the same index calculus algorithm as in the recent computation in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt;) [=GF((2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;)]", May 21, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1305&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3034.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 11 Apr 2013.  The new computation concerned the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6120&lt;/sup&gt; elements and took 749.5 core-hours.

* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 19 Feb 2013.  They used a new variant of the medium-sized base field [[function field sieve]], for binary fields, to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1971&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  In order to use a medium-sized base field, they represented the field as a degree 73 extension of the field of 2&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The computation took 3132 core hours on an SGI Altix ICE 8200EX cluster using Intel (Westmere) Xeon E5650 hex-core processors.&lt;ref&gt;Faruk Gologlu et al.,  On the Function Field Sieve and the Impact of Higher Splitting Probabilities: Application to Discrete Logarithms in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{2^{1971}}&lt;/math&gt;, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/074.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antoine Joux on 11 Feb 2013. This used a new algorithm for small characteristic fields. The computation concerned a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt; elements, represented as a degree 127 extension of the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The computation took less than 220 core hours.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt;)", Feb. 11, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1302&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total computing time was equivalent to 68 days on one core of CPU (sieving) and 30 hours on a GPU (linear algebra).

==Elliptic curves==

[[Certicom]] Corp. has issued a series of Elliptic Curve Cryptography challenges.  Level I involves fields of 109-bit and 131-bit sizes.  Level II includes 163, 191, 239, 359-bit sizes. All Level II challenges are currently believed to be computationally infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Corp., “The Certicom ECC Challenge,” http://www.certicom.com/index.php/the-certicom-ecc-challenge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Level I challenges which have been met are:&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Research, Certicom ECC Challenge (Certicom Research, November 10, 2009), {{cite web |url=http://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022135946/https://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-22 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental migrants''' are people who are forced to leave their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment.  These are changes which compromise their well-being or secure livelihood. Such changes are held to include increased [[droughts]], [[desertification]], [[sea level rise]], and disruption of seasonal [[weather]] patterns (i.e. [[monsoon]]s[[Environmental migrant#cite note-Terminski.2C Bogumil 2011-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Climate refugees may choose to flee to or migrate to another country, or they may migrate internally within their own country.[[Environmental migrant#cite note-Myers-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The term "environmental migrant" is used somewhat interchangeably with a range of similar terms, such as '''ecological refugee''', '''environmental refugee''', '''climate refugee''', '''forced environmental migrant''', '''environmentally motivated migrant''', '''climate change refugee''', '''environmentally displaced person (EDP)''', '''disaster refugee''', '''environmental displacee''', '''eco-refugee''', '''ecologically displaced person''', or '''environmental-refugee-to-be (ERTB)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Boano, C., Zetter, R., and Morris, T., (2008). Environmentally Displaced People: Understanding the linkages between environmental change, livelihoods and forced migration, [[Refugee Studies Centre]] Policy Brief No.1 (RSC: Oxford), pg.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''climate exiles''' has been used to refer to those climate migrants who may be in danger of becoming [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The distinctions between these terms are contested.

Despite problems in formulating a uniform and clear-cut definition of 'environmental migration', such a concept has increased as an issue of concern in the 2000s as [[policy]]-makers, environmental and social scientists attempt to conceptualize the potential societal [[Effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] and general [[environmental degradation]]. "Unless it is assumed" in order to consider a person a climate refugee, nature or the environment could be considered the persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|title=Environmental Degradation and Migration|last=Renaud, Fabrice et. al|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705141123/http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and concept ==
Climate refugees do not really fit into any of the legal [[Refugee#Legal definition|definitions of a refugee]]. Not all climate refugees migrate from their home country, on occasion they are just displaced within their country of origin. Moreover, the refugees aren't leaving their homes because of fear they will be persecuted, or because of "generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf |page19&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the definition of who is a refugee was expanded since its first international and legally binding definition in [[1951 Refugee Convention|1951]] people who are forced to flee due to environmental change are still not offered the same legal protection as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Lindsey. ( 16 February 2012).  ''[http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/treading-water-climate-change-the-maldives-and-de-territorialization/ Treading Water: Climate Change, the Maldives, and De-territorialization]''. Stimson Centre.  Retrieved 25 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "environmental refugee" was first proposed by [[Lester Brown]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Mcgrath, P., and Stokes, B., (1976). twenty two dimensions of the population problem, Worldwatch Paper 5, Washington DC: [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) proposes the following definition for environmental migrants:&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/shared/shared/mainsite/about_iom/en/council/94/MC_INF_288.pdf|title=DISCUSSION NOTE: MIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Climate refugees or climate migrants are a subset of environmental migrants who were forced to flee "due to sudden or gradual alterations in the [[natural environment]] related to at least one of three impacts of [[climate change]]: [[sea-level rise]], [[extreme weather]] events, and [[drought]] and [[water scarcity]]."&lt;ref&gt;Global Governance Project. (2012). [http://www.glogov.org/?pageid=80 Forum on Climate Refugees]. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The [[International Organisation for Migration]] proposes three types of environmental migrants:
*''Environmental emergency migrants'': people who flee temporarily due to an environmental disaster or sudden environmental event. (Examples: someone forced to leave due to a hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, etc.)
*''Environmental forced migrants'': people who have to leave due to deteriorating environmental conditions. (Example: someone forced to leave due to a slow deterioration of their environment such as [[deforestation]], coastal deterioration, etc.)
*''Environmental motivated migrants'' also known as ''environmentally induced economic migrants'': people who choose to leave to avoid possible future problems. (Example: someone who leaves due to declining crop productivity caused by desertification)

&lt;blockquote&gt;“those displaced temporarily due to local disruption such as an avalanche or earthquake; those who migrate because environmental degradation has undermined their livelihood or poses unacceptable risks to health; and those who resettle because [[land degradation]] has resulted in desertification or because of other permanent and untenable changes in their habitat.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|title=Environmental Degradation and Migration|last=Renaud, Fabrice et. al.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705141123/http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Enumeration ==

=== Global statistics ===
There have been a number of attempts over the decades to enumerate environmental migrants and refugees. Jodi Jacobson (1988) is cited as the first researcher to enumerate the issue, stating that there were already up to 10 million ‘Environmental Refugees’. Drawing on ‘worst-case scenarios’ about sea-level rise, she argued that all forms of ‘Environmental Refugees’ would be six times as numerous as political refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, J.L. (1988). Environmental Refugees: a Yardstick of Habitability, Worldwatch paper 86, Worldwatch Institute, Washington DC, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba|Mustafa Tolba]], Executive Director of UNEP, was claiming that 'as many as 50 million people could become environmental refugees' if the world did not act to support sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mostafa Kamal Tolba|Tolba, M. K.]] (1989). Our biological heritage under siege. Bioscience 39, 725–728, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC 1990: 20) declared that the greatest single consequence of climate change could be migration, ‘with millions of people displaced by shoreline erosion, coastal flooding and severe drought’.&lt;ref&gt;Warner K and Laczko F. (2008). ‘Migration, Environment and Development: New Directions for Research’, in Chamie J, Dall’Oglio L (eds.), International Migration and Development, Continuing the Dialogue: Legal and Policy Perspectives, IOM, page 235&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, British environmentalist, [[Norman Myers]], became the most prominent proponent of this ‘maximalist’ school (Suhrke 1993). Noting, that "environmental refugees will soon become the largest group of involuntary refugees".&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, Norman. "Environmental Refugees: A Growing Phenomenon ." Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences 357.1420 (2002): 609. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he stated that there were 25 million environmental refugees in the mid-1990s, further claiming that this figure could double by 2010, with an upper limit of 200 million by 2050 (Myers 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1997). ‘Environmental Refugees’, Population and Environment 19(2): 167–82&lt;/ref&gt; Myers argued that the causes of environmental displacement would include desertification, lack of water, salination of irrigated lands and the depletion of biodiversity. He also hypothesised that displacement would amount to 30m in China, 30m in India, 15m in Bangladesh, 14m in Egypt, 10m in other delta areas and coastal zones, 1m in island states, and with otherwise agriculturally displaced people totalling 50m by 2050.&lt;ref name="Myers, N 1995"&gt;Myers, N. and Kent, J. (1995). Environmental Exodus: an Emergent Crisis in the Global Arena, (Climate Institute{{Who|date=December 2011}}: Washington DC)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Myers has suggested that the figure by 2050 might be as high as 250 million.&lt;ref name="Christian Aid 2007"&gt;Christian Aid (2007). ‘Human Tide: The Real Migration Crisis’ (CA: London), page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims have gained significant currency, with the most common projection being that the world will have 150–200 million climate change refugees by 2050. Variations of this claim have been made in influential reports on climate change by the IPCC (Brown 2008: 11)&lt;ref name="iom.int"&gt;Brown, O (2008). ‘Migration and Climate Change’, [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] Migration Research Series, paper no.31, www.iom.int&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (Stern et al. 2006: 3),&lt;ref&gt;Stern, N. (Ed.) (2006). The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review, [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by NGOs such as Friends of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Friends of the Earth]], ‘A Citizen's Guide to Climate Refugees, Fact Sheet Four: Predictions of Climate Refugees to 2050’ (FOTE: London), 2007: 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenpeace Germany (Jakobeit and Methmann 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Jakobeit, C., and Methmann, C.

Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Myers is the most cited researcher in this field, who found that 25 million environmental migrants existed in 1995 in his work (Myers &amp; Kent 1995),&lt;ref name="Myers, N 1995"/&gt; which drew upon over 1000 sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth, A Citizen's Guide to Climate Refugees, Fact Sheet Four: Predictions of Climate Refugees to 2050&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Vikram Kolmannskog]] has stated that Myers’ work can be ‘criticized for being inconsistent, impossible to check and failing to take proper account of opportunities to adapt’ (2008: 9).&lt;ref&gt;Kolmannskog, V (2008). Future Floods of Refugees, ([[Norwegian Refugee Council]]: Oslo)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Myers himself has acknowledged that his figures are based upon ‘heroic extrapolation’ (Brown 2008: 12).&lt;ref name="iom.int"/&gt; More generally, Black has argued that there is ‘surprisingly little scientific evidence’ that indicates that the world is ‘filling-up with environmental refugees’ (1998: 23).&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. (1998). Refugees, Environment and Development, Harlow: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Francois Gemenne has stated that: 'When it comes to predictions, figures are usually based on the number of people living in regions at risk, and not on the number of people actually expected to migrate. Estimates do not account for adaptation strategies [or] different levels of vulnerability' (Gemenne 2009: 159).&lt;ref&gt;Gemenne, F (2009). ‘Environmental Migration: Normative Frameworks and Policy Prescriptions’, Doctoral Thesis, Sciences-Po, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia and the Pacific ===

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced by drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CFA06/(httpPublications)/D558B66C3B055DE0C12578A7002C0FE1?OpenDocument |title=Displacement due to natural hazard-induced disasters: Global estimates for 2009 and 2010 |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |date= |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301165512/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CFA06/(httpPublications)/D558B66C3B055DE0C12578A7002C0FE1?OpenDocument |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-induced migration is a highly complex issue which needs to be understood as part of global migration dynamics. Migration typically has multiple causes, and environmental factors are intertwined with other social and economic factors, which themselves can be influenced by environmental changes. Environmental migration should not be treated solely as a discrete category, set apart from other migration flows. A 2012 Asian Development Bank study argues that climate-induced migration should be addressed as part of a country's development agenda, given the major implications of migration on economic and social development. The report recommends interventions both to address the situation of those who have migrated, as well as those who remain in areas subject to environmental risk. It says: "To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen the resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |title=Addressing Climate Change Migration in Asia &amp; the Pacific 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is maintained that the poor populate areas that are most at risk for environmental destruction and climate change, including coastlines, flood-lines, and steep slopes. As a result, climate change threatens areas already suffering from extreme poverty. "The issue of equity is crucial. Climate affects us all, but does not affect us all equally," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told delegates at a climate conference in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="World Vision"&gt;[http://www.worldvision.ca/ContentArchives/content-stories/Pages/EnvironmentalRefugees "Environmental Refugees."] World Vision Canada.

In 2013 a claim of a [[Kiribati]] man of being a "climate change refugee" under the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable.&lt;ref name="THC1"&gt;{{cite web| work= NZLII |title= Teitiota v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2013] NZHC 3125 (26 November 2013)|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/2013/3125.html| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | title= "Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision | publisher= Point Source | date= 14 August 2014 | quote=  | author= Vernon Rive | accessdate= 11 February 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150211073607/http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | archivedate= 11 February 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Refugee Convention did not apply as there is no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated convention grounds. The Court rejected the argument that the international community itself (or countries which can be said to have been historically high emitters of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases) were the “persecutor” for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.&lt;ref name="THC1"/&gt;
This analysis of the need for the person to identify persecution of the type described in the Refugee Convention does not exclude the possibility that a people for countries experiencing severe impacts of climate change can come with the Refugee Convention. However, it is not the climate change event itself, rather the social and political response to climate change, which is likely to create the pathway for a successful claim. The New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal and the High Court, “there is a complex inter-relationship between natural disasters, environmental degradation and human vulnerability. Sometimes a tenable pathway to international protection under the Refugee Convention can result. Environmental issues sometimes lead to armed conflict. There may be ensuing violence towards or direct repression of an entire section of a population. Humanitarian relief can become politicised, particularly in situations where some group inside a disadvantaged country is the target of direct discrimination.”&lt;ref name="THC2"&gt;{{cite web| work= NZLII |title= Teitiota v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2013] NZHC 3125 (26 November 2013) [27]|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/2013/3125.html| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Court of Appeal also rejected the claim in a [[Teitiota v Chief Executive Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|2014 decision]]. On further appeal, the New Zealand Supreme Court confirmed the earlier adverse rulings against the application for refugee status, with the Supreme Court also rejecting the proposition “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could never create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”&lt;ref name="TSC"&gt;{{cite web| work= NZLII |title= Teitiota v Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2015] NZSC 107 (20 July 2015) [13]|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZSC/2015/107.html| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 attention was drawn to an appeal to the [[New Zealand]] Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were "climate change refugees", who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of [[Tuvalu]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web| last = Rick| first = Noack | title= Has the era of the ‘climate change refugee’ begun?| work=Washington Post |date=7 August 2014|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/07/has-the-era-of-the-climate-change-refugee-begun/|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite web | last= Rive | first= Vernon | title= "Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision | publisher= Point Source | date= 14 August 2014 | url= http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | accessdate= 11 February 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150211073607/http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | archivedate= 11 February 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were "exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature" that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=PS/&gt;

==== Alaska ====
There have been 178 Alaskan communities threatened by erosion of their land. The annual temperature has steadily increased over the last fifty years, with Alaska seeing it double (compared to the rate seen across the rest of the United States) to the rate of 3.4 degrees, with an alarming 6.3 degrees increase for the winters over the past fifty years. Many of the communities residing in these areas have been living off the land for generations. There is an eminent threat of loss of culture and loss of tribal identity with these communities.&lt;ref&gt;BARTH, BRIAN. "Before It's Too Late." ''Planning'' 82.8 (2016): 14–20. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 21 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] identified four Alaskan villages which need to relocate due to the risk of flooding and erosion. More villages were added to this list between 2003 and 2016. One of the villages, [[Shishmaref, Alaska|Shishmaref]], has 650 people who are at risk of becoming the first American community climate refugees. However, relocation is proving difficult because there is no governmental institutional framework that exists for the aid of climate refugees in the United States. The Obama administration promised to fund $50.4 billion to help with relocation efforts in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mintpressnews.com/alaskan-villagers-may-become-first-climate-change-refugees-town-swallowed-rising-sea/219576/|title=Alaskan Villagers May Become First ‘Climate Change Refugees’ As Town Swallowed By Rising Sea|last=Dreams|first=Lauren McCauley {{!}} Common|date=2016-08-18|work=MintPress News|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louisiana ====
[[Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana]], home to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw First Nation, is being depopulated with federal grant money, due to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise.  This Indigenous Nation residing on the Isle de Jean Charles is facing the effects of climate change. The resettlement of this community of around 100, exists as the first migration of a total community in the state of Louisiana. This state has lost almost 2000 square miles of its coast within the last 87 years and now an alarming rate of almost 16 square miles a year is disappearing. In early 2016, a 48-million-dollar grant was the first allocation of federal tax dollars to aid a community suffering from direct impact of climate change. Louisiana has lost land mass comparable to the size of the state of Delaware revealing land mass loss that is at a rate faster than many places in the world. The resettlement plan for the Isle de Jean Charles is at the forefront of responding to climate change without destroying the community that resides within.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Craig.

=== South America ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

Many peer-reviewed articles analyzing migration in South America have found multiple types of linkages between climate change and its effect on migration.The effects and results vary based on the type of climatic change, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics of migrants and the distance and direction of the migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Clark|last2=Bilsborrow|first2=Richard|date=2013-08-01|title=Environmental Influences on Human Migration in Rural Ecuador|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-012-0192-y|journal=Demography|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1217–1241|doi=10.1007/s13524-012-0192-y|issn=0070-3370|pmc=3661740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most climate migration studies are done in the developed world, scientists have called for more quantitative research within the developing world, including South America.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiede|first=Brian|last2=Gray|first2=Clark|last3=Mueller|first3=Valerie|title=Climate variability and inter-provincial migration in South America, 1970–2011|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959378016303909|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=41|pages=228–240|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.10.005|pmid=28413264|pmc=5389124|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration in South America does not always increase as a result of increased environmental threats but is affected by factors such as climate variability and land suitability. These migrations happen either gradually or suddenly but are typically directed from rural to urban areas.  Inter-provincial migration is shown to not be as heavily influenced by environmental changes whereas migration outside of the home country is heavily influenced by environmental changes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The results of a climactic event catalyzing migration change depending on the onset of the event, however, climate change related events such as drought and hurricanes augment or increase youth migration. Youth are more likely to migrate as a response to climate-related events. As a result, children who have been displaced are found to travel shorter distances to find work in rural destinations versus further to an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=Javier|last2=Caruso|first2=German|last3=Mueller|first3=Valerie|last4=Niu|first4=Chiyu|date=2017-02-01|title=Droughts augment youth migration in Northern Latin America and the Caribbean|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1863-2|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=140|issue=3–4|pages=423–435|doi=10.1007/s10584-016-1863-2|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest a review of the terms that define who is an environmental migrant since policy-making bodies and intergovernmental agencies most affect responses when an environmental event causes people to migrate. Because of the increase in interest in this topic in the past decade some people call for a measure called preventive resettlement. The cases in which preventive resettlement appear appropriate is typically discerned by local and governmental bodies. Others call for an increase in social programs to both prevent and help in a migration event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690464881?accountid=12725|title=Climate-Induced Resettlement: Environmental Change and the Planned Relocation of Communities|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) has argued that the people who will be forced to move due to climate change currently have no adequate recognition in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page590.html "No place like home – climate refugees"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107061956/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page590.html |date=7 November 2009 }}, The Environmental Justice Foundation, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The EJF contends that a new multilateral legal instrument is required to specifically address the needs of "climate refugees" in order to confer protection to those fleeing environmental degradation and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/03/global-warming-climate-refugees "Global warming could create 150 million climate refugees by 2050"] John Vidal, The Guardian, 3 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also asserted that additional funding is needed to enable developing countries to adapt to climate change. [[Sujatha Byravan]] and Sudhir Chella Rajan have argued for the use of the  term 'climate exiles' and for international agreements to provide them political and legal rights, including citizenship in other countries, bearing in mind those countries' responsibilities and capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0DE1230F93AA35756C0A9639C8B63 "Before the Flood"] Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, [[The New York Times]], 9 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/14119.pdf "Warming up to Immigrants: An Option for US Climate Policy"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, Economic and Political Weekly, 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/24_3/features/001.html "The Ethical Implications of Sea-Level Rise Due to Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813155135/http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/24_3/features/001.html |date=13 August 2011 }} Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, Ethics &amp; International Affairs, Volume 24.3 (Fall 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, climate change may lead to conflict arising between countries that as a result of flooding or other conditions produce a large number of refugees, and bordering countries that build fences to keep out these refugees. The [[Bangladesh–India border]] is largely separated via a fence, and case studies suggest the possibility of violent conflict arising due to people fleeing from areas suffering from the destruction of [[arable land]]. Current migration has already resulted in low-scale conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litchfield|first=William Alex|title=Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events &amp; Sea Level Rise in Bangladesh leading to Migration and Conflict|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/Bangladesh.html|work=[[American University]]|publisher=ICE Case Studies|accessdate=19 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720133948/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/Bangladesh.html|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that sea levels will increase with up to 0.6 meters by 2100. This will cause populations to wipe out entirely. Small areas may have nothing left. This could lead to the loss of millions of refugees. Refugee organizations have taken on cases of many different refugees. The Organization for Refugees Asylum and Migration (ORAM) is designed to help refugees in seeking status and resettlement. They are designed to help refugees overcome the Refugee process. ORAM’s main goal is to protect the vulnerable refugees for the laws put on refugee and help end the refugee asylum process. There is a ton of legal action taken against refugees. Political laws are put on the refugees to either harm or hurt the refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/climate-refugee/|title=climate refugee|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-06-17|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global perceptions from possible countries of asylum ===
Reaction as for the possible acceptance of possible environmental migrants is mixed, this is because of countries dealing with other domestic problems. For example, India, which has a population of over 1 billion people, is building an [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier|India-Bangladesh barrier]]. While the stated purpose of the barrier is to deter drug trade, the barrier may also help prevent the possible refuge of 20 million Bangladeshis who may be displaced by future climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/30/rich-west-climate-change|title=UK should open borders to climate refugees, says Bangladeshi minister|last=Grant|first=Harriet|date=4 December 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=|work=|last2=Randerson|first2=James|last3=Vidal|first3=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contrast to Canada in which public pressure is slowly building to create policies that will allow accommodation and better planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Sheila|year=2010|title=Environmental Migrants and Canada's Refugee Policy|url=|journal=Refuge: Canada's Periodical on Refugees|volume=27|pages=|via=Academic ONEfile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2014/11/05/ottawa_urged_to_open_doors_to_climate_migrants.html|title=Ottawa urged to open doors to ‘climate migrants’ {{!}} Toronto Star|last=Keung|first=Nicholas|date=|website=thestar.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/10/30/exodus-climate-refugees-has-just-begun-where-will-they-go|title=Mass migration crisis likely to get much worse|last=Dinshaw|first=Fram|date=30 October 2015|website=National Observer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/03/11/environmental-migrants-breathing-easier-in-canada.html|title=Environmental migrants breathing easier in Canada {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2016, [[Justin Trudeau|Prime Minister Trudeau]] of Canada told the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants that plans just for resettlement would not be enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/09/20/opinion/climate-refugees-we-don%E2%80%99t-have-plan|title=Climate refugees?

Asylum is the freedom of prosecution in the country the people want to be in. Different countries have their own rules and laws of asylum. The United States, for example, has a system recognized by federal and international laws. France was the first country to constitute the right to asylum. So the right to asylum differs in different nations. There is a still fight for the right to asylum in some areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/28883-the-invisible-climate-refugees|title=The invisible climate refugees|work=United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC)|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspective of countries taking immigrants ===
In the UK, research is being done on how climate change’s impact on countries that are emigrated to will vary due to the infrastructure of those countries. They want to put into place policies so that those who have to migrate could go throughout Europe, and have solid emergency planning in place so that the people being displaced would have a swift and quick plan of escape once their environment can no longer handle inhabitants-slow or sudden onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkiss|first=Stephanie|year=2010|title=Environmental Refugees: An Accountability Perspective|url=|journal=University of Wollongong|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end goal of this work is to determine the best course of action in the event of various environmental catastrophes.

==Popular culture==

[[File:World Climate Refugee Camp in Hannover.jpg|200px|right|thumb|German artist [[Hermann Josef Hack]]'s ''World Climate Refugee Camp'' in Hannover displaying 600 small climate refugee tents.]] The notion of 'environmental migrant', and particularly 'climate refugee', has gained traction in popular culture. A documentary entitled ''Climate Refugees'' has been released. "Climate Refugees" is an Official Selection for the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/climaterefugees_sundance2010 Climate Refugees at Sundance Film Festival 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014331/http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/climaterefugees_sundance2010 |date=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Short Documentary Academy Award Nominee, [[Sun Come Up (film)|Sun Come Up]] (2011), tells the story of Carteret islanders who are forced to leave their ancestral land in response to climate change and migrate to war-torn Bougainville &lt;ref name="Sun Come Up"&gt;"[http://www.suncomeup.com/film/Home Sun Come Up: Home]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."

Since 2007, German artist [[Hermann Josef Hack]] has shown his World Climate Refugee Camp in the centers of various European cities. The model camp, made of roughly 1000 miniature tents, is a public art intervention that depicts the social impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hermann-josef-hack.de/enid/2034bbfb0dddddd028dfd1cea74969d5,d2251461727469636c655f6964092d09373534/3o.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040127/http://www.hermann-josef-hack.de/enid/2034bbfb0dddddd028dfd1cea74969d5,d2251461727469636c655f6964092d09373534/3o.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 July 2011 |title=Hermann Josef Hack Website |publisher=Hermann-josef-hack.de |date= |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faith and Globalisation Initiative''' ('''FGI''') is an international group of universities created in 2008 by former [[British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |title=Introduction to Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Yale University=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928130909/http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Faith and Globalisation Initiative is "bringing together some of the world’s leading research Universities to form a global network focusing on the emerging field of faith and globalisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |title=Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151638/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and key objectives==
In 2008 Yale University was the first university the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Foundation]] started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151655/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline.

Key objectives of the FGI are the following:
* Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation
* Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation
* Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation
* Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation
* Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

'''''Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation''''' is a 2013 book by the German [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Christian Welzel]], professor of [[political culture]] and [[political sociology]] at [[Lüneburg University|Leuphana University Lueneburg]] and vice-president of the [[World Values Survey]].

==The Title==
The title, ''Freedom Rising'', refers to the rapid expansion of universal freedoms and democracy. As the author explains at the beginning of his book, people have never voiced their desires for freedoms so frequently and powerfully as today. They do so not only inside but even outside democracies.&lt;ref name="Welzel2013FR"&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 2| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from here, Christian Welzel’s book is about the human quest for freedoms and the human desire for emancipation. The result is a far-reaching theory of emancipation, which describes the human empowerment process.

==Content and Structure==
The book comprises twelve chapters that are organized in four parts. While the first chapter is theoretical, all subsequent chapters are empirical and test the propositions laid out in Chapter 1. The empirical research builds on cross-cultural and longitudinal evidence form the [[World Values Survey]]s and European Values Surveys.

===Part A: Understanding Emancipative Values===
(Chapter 1:	A Theory of Emancipation;
Chapter 2:	Mapping Differences;
Chapter 3:	Multilevel Drivers;
Chapter 4:	Tracing Change)

The first part provides a basic understanding of emancipative values. Welzel introduces the endogenous cause to [[Human development theory|human development]] in his sequence thesis of [[emancipation]]. The thesis establishes a main direction of [[causality]] from action resources (founding element) to emancipative values (linking element) to civic entitlements (completing element). It argues that emancipative values result from expanding [[resources]] which implies that they are a [[Cultural universal|universal]] and not a Western-bound concept. The concept of cross-fertilization highlights the amplification of a person's values when they are shared by more people in the same society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 37–169 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part B: Emancipative Values as Civic Force===
(Chapter 5:	Intrinsic Qualities; 
Chapter 6:	Benign Individualism;
Chapter 7:	Collective Action)

The second part presents emancipative values as a pro-social set of values and a groundbreaking civic force that "unlocks a population's intrinsic qualities, vitalizes civil society, and creates social capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 12| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welzel illustrates that rising emancipative values cause a strategic shift from acquisition strategies to thriving strategies. As thriving strategies aim at fulfillment, pro-social behavior is encouraged. The activating and empowering impulse of emancipative values instigates people to have their shared claims heard. As such emancipative values are a crucial source of bottom-up democratization processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 173–246| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part C: Democratic Impulses of Emancipative Values===
(Chapter 8:	Entitling People;
Chapter 9:	The Rights Revolution;
Chapter 10:	The Paradox of Democracy)

The third part centers on the [[Democracy|democratic]] impulse that emanates from emancipative values. Welzel presents democracy as the institutional element of people's power and action resources together with emancipative values as the two pre-institutional elements of [[people power]]. Empirical evidence shows that rising emancipative values have a much higher effect on expanding rights than rights have on rising emancipative values. Welzel concludes that institutions themselves cannot create empowering qualities but depend on them so that the source of democracy lies in the people's desire for emancipation. Here, ''Freedom Rising'' disproves the prominent view in political economy which states that institutions come first. Finally, chapter 10 solves the democratic paradox that widespread desires for democracy among people coexist with deficient or even absent democracy. Welzel argues that this is the case when these desires are decoupled from an emphasis on emancipative values that is a critical-liberal orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 249–331 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part D: Emancipative Values in Human Civilization===
(Chapter 11:	The Redirection of Civilization;
Chapter 12:	The Sustainability Challenge)

The last part looks at emancipative values from a broad civilizational perspective and discusses their significance in history. Welzel presents the [[#The Cool-Water Condition|cool-water condition]] (CW condition) as the truly exogenous cause of human empowerment. The last chapter elaborates on the role of emancipative values in meeting the [[sustainability]] challenge. Here, Welzel addresses the dilemma that results from the negative environmental impact of technological advancement on the one hand and the positive environmental impact of emancipative values on environmental quality on the other hand. Closer investigation shows that the negative impact of technological advancement is lower than the positive impact of emancipative values on environmental quality. Human empowerment thus helps redirecting society towards [[sustainable development]].

==The Human Empowerment Process==
The Human Empowerment Process is defined by Welzel as a "humanistic transformation of civilization that makes societies increasingly people-powered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 6 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be observed when freedoms grow so that Welzel calls it an emancipatory process. It is completed when people are acting freely as agents of their values.
Welzel distinguishes between three different stages of the human condition in societies. The human condition can be (1) suffering – weak capabilities and narrow guarantees, (2) struggling – mediocre capabilities and guarantees, (3) thriving – strong capabilities and wide guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page=22 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Theory of Emancipation==
Welzel builds his human empowerment framework on an evolutionary theory of [[emancipation]]. Emancipation is hereby understood as the universal human desire for an existence free from domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 37 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emancipative values emphasize [[freedom of choice]] and [[equal opportunity|equality of opportunities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 5 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Freedom Rising Welzel identifies the human desire to live free from external constraints as the single source of the human empowerment trend.

The theory of emancipation rests upon one evolutionary root principle: the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel argues that emancipative values do not guide people's actions as long as existential constraints on human life are strong. However, freedoms gain utility when people become more capable due to improving living conditions and rising action resources. In this case emancipative values start guiding people's actions. Emancipative values thus constitute the psychological core and the inspirational source of the human empowerment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 2 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such they motivate social movement activity and promote anti-discrimination norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 5 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since joint action among capable and motivated people is so difficult to resist, rulers must at some point give in and guarantee the claimed entitlements, and also abide by them. The third element in the human empowerment process is thus [[civic right|civic entitlements]].

==The Sequence Thesis of Emancipation==
The Sequence thesis explains the endogenous causation of the human empowerment process. It establishes the dominant flow of impact among the three elements of the human development process from action resources to emancipative values to civic entitlements. Freedoms grow in a utility-value-guarantee sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 37 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sequence thesis implies an important condition, which defies the most common view that human development is caused by institutions. In contrast to other political scientists like [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]], Christian Welzel demonstrates that institutions guaranteeing universal freedoms are not the cause but the result of the human empowerment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 38 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cool-Water Condition==
The sequence thesis of emancipation theory fails to deliver an [[exogeny|exogenous]] causation of human empowerment. Chapter 11 thus introduces a second thesis — the source thesis of emancipation. It posits the original source of human empowerment in the cool-water condition (CW-condition), which "is a combination of (1) moderately cold climates, (2) continuous rainfalls over all seasons, and (3) permanently navigable waterways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 366 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the source thesis, CW areas offer water [[autonomy]] and a higher disease security which naturally locates them higher on the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel demonstrates that the CW condition prevented a transition to agriculture in the first place since foraging was a freer lifestyle. Technological advancement in CW areas was thus lower than in other areas for a long time. With emerging urban markets the situation changed. Water autonomy created derivative autonomies that turned out to be an accelerator of technological advancement. Autonomy in market access encouraged a transition to quality-breeding strategies in people's reproductive behavior with the result that the workforce became less numerous but more valuable. Rising labor demands provided an incentive to invent technologies that save costly labor. The technological advancement involved more widespread action resources, which enhanced people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. From here the sequence thesis of emancipation takes over.

Until today human development is far advanced in all of the world's CW areas, that is in [[Western Europe]], in [[Japan]], in distinctive areas of [[Northern America]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

Welzel stresses that — in the era of [[globalization]] — human empowerment begins to diffuse elsewhere and slowly dissociates from the CW condition. This erodes the monopoly of the West over human empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 375 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genoese map Indian Ocean.jpg|thumb|[[Indian ocean]] portion of the Genoese map.]]
The '''Genoese map''' is a 1457 [[world map]].  The map relied extensively on the account of the traveler to Asia [[Niccolo da Conti]], rather than the usual source of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is not known, but is a more modern development than the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], with fairly good proportions given to each continents.  The map also depicts a three-masted European ship in the [[Indian Ocean]], something which had not occurred yet at the time.&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998" /&gt;

A Genoese flag in the upper northwest corner of the map establishes this map’s origin, along with the coat of arms of the Spinolas, a prominent Genoese mercantile family. Niccolò de'Conti was from a noble mercantile family; at an early age he decided to follow in the family tradition by establishing a lucrative trading operation in the East.[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/niccolo-de-conti]

The Genoese map’s sea monsters reflect the cartographer’s interest in exotic wonders, which is everywhere in evidence on the map, and typical of the scientific outlook of the early modern period, which was driven by curiosity and took a great interest in marvels. The demon-like monster in particular is evidence of the cartographer’s research in recent travel literature to find sea monsters for his map.

This map was done in rich color and was not made particularly used for anything but for display.They say this map was sent to the Portuguese court in 1474 and then to Columbus and this is the map that he used to travel the India sea to the Atlantic but was never proven. The map is now the property of the Italian government and is to be found in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence however the map was not taken care of due to the way it’s been handled throughout the years.

The ships that could carry a thousand men—six hundred seamen and four hundred soldiers. The larger vessels also carried small boats, which were used, as Marco Polo states, “to lay out the anchors, catch fish, bring supplies aboard, and the like. When the ship is under sail, she carries these boats slung to her side.” Many of the vessels had as many as four decks, and even the smaller ones, fifty or sixty cabins. Vegetables, we are told, were sometimes grown on board.

The oval form is not unknown among medieval maps. Hugh of Saint Victor had described the world as being the shape of Noah’s Ark, and Ranulf Higden world maps were oval. A standard way of describing the earth was to compare it to an egg. The main purpose of the analogy seems to have been to describe the various spheres surrounding the earth (egg white, shell), but the idea of an egg shape could have been derived from these works. Another possibility is that the oval form represents the ''mandorla'', or nimbus, which surrounded Christ in many medieval works of art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''Global Polio Eradication Initiative''' is an initiative created in 1988, just after the [[World Health Assembly]] resolved to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate the disease poliomyelitis]] by the year 2000. It was described by the [[World Health Organization]] as the largest public health initiative in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale/Held|first1=Thomas/David|title=The Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations|publisher=Polity press|isbn=978-0-7456-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:

*WHO ([[World Health Organization]]) who are responsible for planning, technical direction, surveillance and eradication certification. 
*[[Rotary International]] whose responsibilities include fundraising, advocacy, and volunteer recruitment.
* The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] who are in charge of deploying scientists and public health experts to WHO and [[UNICEF]].
* [[UNICEF]] is in charge of the distribution of the vaccine and helping countries develop communication and awareness strategies.
* [[The Gates Foundation]] as well provided a large portion of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef's Engagement in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.unicef.org/partners/files/Partnership_profile_2012_Polio_revised.pdf|website=Unicef.org|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance 
through investigation of [[acute flaccid paralysis]] cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting "mop up" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassilak/Orenstein|first1=Steven/Walter|title=Challenges faced by the global polio eradication initiative|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=2010|doi=10.1586/erv.10.45|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.45|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
By 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the [[Gates Foundation]] 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccination funding landscape|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/vaccination-organizations#Eradicationinitiatives|website=Givewell.org|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Technical Consultative Group to the World Health Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis|title="Endgame" Issues for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2002|volume=34|pages=72–77|doi=10.1086/338262|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.abstract|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). [[India]], which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Monitoring|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx|website=Global Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the [[Gates Foundation]] instead of from individual countries. In fact [[Bill Gates]] has listed polio eradication as one of his "Top Personal Priorities".

A 2011 study by [[Middlebury College]] (commissioned by the [[Gates Foundation]]) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:

*  Include surveillance for other diseases in AFP (polio) surveillance systems
* Use integrated campaigns to reach marginalized populations
* Standardize and compile polio’s maps of marginalized populations to provide them with additional services
* Fund routine immunization in locations with frequent polio campaigns
* Build staff capacity in a variety of areas beyond polio
* Share pertinent information gathered during polio campaigns with other health programs
* Add questions on key health indicators of interest to post campaign monitoring
* Communicate to workers why repeated campaigns are necessary in high intensity areas
* Raise monetary incentives for campaign workers to a living wage or eliminate them entirely
* Conduct cross planning sessions to determine how programs and services can be integrated to reduce workforce burden without compromising programmatic objectives
* Conduct polio campaigns only where and when they are necessary
*  Mitigate the most serious effects of service interruption with strategic planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
The final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the "endgame" are as follows:
#  Detect and interrupt all poliovirus transmissions
# Strengthen immunization systems and withdraw oral polio vaccine
#  Contain poliovirus and certify interruption of transmission
# Ensure the remaining investments made to eradicate polio go to the greater cause of improving global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/resourcelibrary/strategyandwork.aspx|website=Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">'''Global apartheid''' is a term used to mean [[minority rule]] in international decision-making. The term comes from [[apartheid]], the system of governmental that ruled [[South Africa]] until 27 April 1994 when people of all races were able to vote as equals for the first time.

The concept of global apartheid has been developed by many researchers, including [[Titus Alexander]], [[Bruno Amoroso]], [[Patrick Bond]], [[Gernot Kohler]], [[Arjun Makhijiani]], [[Ali Mazuri]], [[Vandana Shiva]], Anthony H. Richmond, [[Joseph Nevins]], [[Muhammed Asadi]], [[Gustav Fridolin]], and many others.&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander"&gt;Titus Alexander, Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics, Polity Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Amoroso, Global Apartheid.

Asadi, Global Apartheid, iUniverse, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per Gustav Edvard Fridolin,  Från Vittsjö till världen - om global apartheid och alla vi som vill någon annanstans (From Vittsjö to the world - about global apartheid and everyone of us that want to go somewhere), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and use ==
The first use of the term may have been by Gernot Koehler in a 1978 Working Paper for the [[World Order Models Project]].  In 1995 Koehler develop this in ''The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential''.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 20, No. 3 (July-September 1995), pp. 403-413&lt;/ref&gt;

Its best known use was by [[Thabo Mbeki]], then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons of the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.&lt;ref&gt;Haviland, William (1993). Cultural Anthropology. Vermont: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers. p. 250-252&lt;/ref&gt;  Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of [[Charter 99]], a campaign for [[democratic mundialization|global democracy]], who was also present at the UN [[Millennium Summit]] and gave him a copy of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid''.

== Concept ==
Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa ''civilized labour'' policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of immigrants seeking work.

At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system ([[Bank of International Settlements]]), [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[Security Council]] and other institutions of global governance.  The [[G8]] represent less than 15% of world population, yet have over 60% of its income.  80% of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and [[WTO]] and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).  By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European.  Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority.

In ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', [[Samuel P. Huntington]] describes how "the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P Huntington The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, (p81)&lt;/ref&gt;  Huntington quoted Jeffrey R Bennett to claim that Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey R Bennett ‘Exclusion as National Security Policy’, Parameters, 24, Spring 1994, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

* own and operate the international banking system
* control all hard currencies
* are the world’s principle customer
* provide the majority of the world’s finished goods
* dominate international capital markets
* exert considerable moral leadership within many societies
* are capable of massive military intervention
* control the sea lanes

Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ [p308]

Alexander identifies numerous ''pillars of global apartheid'' including:&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander" /&gt;
*veto power by the Western minority in the UN [[Security Council]] 
*voting powers in the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]]
*dominance of the [[World Trade Organization]] through effective veto power and ‘weight of trade’ rather than formal voting power
*one-sided rules of trade, which give privileged protection to Western agriculture and other interests while opening markets in the Majority World
*protection of ‘hard currency’ through the central banking system through the [[Bank of International Settlements]] 
*immigration controls which manage the flow of labour to meet the needs of Western economies 
*use of aid and investment to control elites in the Majority World through reward and punishment 
*support for coups or military intervention in countries which defy Western dominance

International decision-making has a legacy of [[international inequality|inequality]] which some authors{{Who|date=September 2015}} have compared to historical [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A '''global recession''' is [[recession]] that affects many countries around the world—that is, a period of global economic slowdown or declining economic output.

== Definitions ==
The [[International Monetary Fund]] defines a global recession as "a decline in annual per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP ([[purchasing power parity]] weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per{{nbhyph}}capita investment, and per{{nbhyph}}capita consumption".&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What’s a Global Recession?|publisher=The Walstreet Journal|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf|title=World Economic Outlook - April 2009: Crisis and Recovery|format=PDF|work=Box 1.1 (page 11-14)|publisher=IMF|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this definition, since [[World War II]] there were only four global recessions (in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009), all of them only lasting a year (although the 1991 recession would have lasted until 1993 if the IMF had used normal exchange rate weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP rather than the [[purchasing power parity]] weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP).&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt; The 2009 global recession, also known as the [[Great Recession]], was by far the worst of the four postwar recessions, both in terms of the number of countries affected and the decline in real World GDP per capita.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt;

Before April 2009, the IMF argued that a global annual [[real GDP]] growth rate of 3.0 percent or less was "equivalent to a global recession".&lt;ref name="economist-12381879"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381879 |title=The world economy Bad, or worse |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lall, Subir.

== Overview ==
Informally, a national [[recession]] is a period of declining economic output. In a 1974 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, [[Julius Shiskin]] suggested several [[rules of thumb]] to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), a measure of the nation's output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Achuthan |first=Lakshman |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/05/news/economy/recession/index.htm |title=The risk of redefining recession, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, Economic Cycle Research Institute, May 7, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but not the United States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUUg6ckAsM5U&amp;refer=hom Japan's Economy Shrinks 0.4%, Confirming Recession]
By Jason Clenfield&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a national recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a '''global recession''' is more difficult, because a [[Developing country]] is expected to have a higher GDP growth than a [[Developed country]].&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/update/03/index.htm |title=IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update - Rapidly Weakening Prospects Call for New Policy Stimulus - November 2008 |publisher=Imf.org |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and [[Liquidity risk|liquidity problems]]. Countries in [[East Asia]] (including [[China]]) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03" /&gt;

The IMF estimates that global recessions occur over a cycle lasting between eight and ten years. During what the IMF terms the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=arlKrFbn3pfY&amp;refer=home|title=Global Recession Risk Grows as U.S. `Damage' Spreads.

[[File:Global Regional Powers.png|thumb|Global Regional Powers]]

'''Global regionalization''' is a process which is parallel to [[globalization]]. The most important feature of the [[global community]] is globalization of many processes and phenomena of the development of [[international relations]], strengthening relationships and interdependence of modern states in the second half of the 20th century. Globalization is evident not only globally, but also regionally. An important component of international relations in the 21st century is regional development and cooperation. In this regard, the importance of regional significant factor in current international relations.
Most of the changes which is observed in today's world are associated with the development of the information sphere.
There were predictable [[transformation of culture|transformation]] and give rise to the beginning of the entry of humanity into a global information society. The researchers are note five definitions of information society-related parameters identification newness of the world which are technological, economic, concerning employment, spatial or cultural nature.
The significance of the information society in terms of its impact on system are consisting of international relations. In 2000 [[G-8 Summit]] in Okinawa adopted a Charter on Global Information Society, which are reflected to the changes in the world  information. The same issues in lot of attention were paid to the Millennium Summit.

== Regionalization as a trend of global development ==
The driving forces of regionalization are  not only state, but also non-governmental structure (the economic "interest groups", NGOs, political parties, etc.). World regionalism is one of the manifestations of globalization and at the same time it is the opposite trend. Globalization is accompanied by a regionalization of international relations,  transfer of public functions to sub-national or international level. Regions helps to protect public relations of globalization from negative impact and act as an independent subject of international relations. Many developing countries see in regionalization attempt to confront global competition. In the context of globalization acquires special relevance selective protectionism - gradual global economic integration, combining openness to the outside world with the protection of national interests.
Universal theories of regions are exist on the theories of the problem, type, goals and objectives of the study. The following theoretical concepts are reflect to the processes of regionalism, which is a consequence of globalization. They are can be as : [[Multipolar world|Multipolar world theory]], the theory of large spaces, the theory of convergence and regional joint doctrine.
In the study of regionalism are analyzed the regionalization emerging in response to the challenges of globalization, regionalization, such as institutional integration of the process of interpenetration merging national productions which are combine together social and political institutional structure of the state. 
There are different forms and types of integration. They are characterized by the degree of freedom of movement within groups factors of production. Currently there are mentioned forms of regional economic integration as: [[Free-trade area|free trade area]] (FTA); [[Customs union|Customs Union]] (CU); [[Common Market|single or common market]] (BP); [[Economic union|Economic Union]] (EU); [[Economic and monetary union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) and others.

== Information society and international relations ==

Increased of exposure information changes on the international relations caused by a number of features of the information. The first feature - information not only decreases or disappears in his large-scale use but it is starting point for the formation of new species and new qualities. The second feature - information is a fundamental principle for the development and decision-making at all levels of government, including the level of global governance. Third - feature information is "[[Oedipus effect]]", is the ability to influence the mind and behavior of individuals and society in general.
Developing of the [[Global Information Society Watch|global information society]] are  influenced by the progress of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in conjunction with the globalization of markets, both within individual countries and internationally. As a result, the harmonious joining the information society and respecting the necessary balance required coordinating efforts by the state as a body that can fully express the interests of society. Creating of a global information society are requires to the overcoming informational imbalances that exist in the world  between different countries and regions, as well as information imbalances existing within themselves, for example, between different social groups. Because of these disparities, the task of building the information society acquire varying degrees of importance for different countries. Due to the intensification of information exchange and its interplay with economic imbalances interaction available information provided to the growing influence of politics, economics and culture.
 
In 1993 the Vice President of US - A. Gore used the term "[[information superhighway]]." In the field of information, the states like Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Australia and Iceland are according to the United States. In the information technology ratings Russia is in the  sixth place in the top ten. Below - Morocco, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peru, Tanzania. In 1996 was adopted the programme " Participation in international cultural exchange" by the Federal Law.
To stay among the countries that affect global politics and largely define it, needs to strengthen active in shaping the global information society. At the end of 2001 Russia issued to the First Committee of the UN General Assembly resolution "Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security". However, according to the Institute of the Information Society, 64% of the population of Russia does not feel the need to use the Internet.	This figure was the result of adding Methodology Center for International Development at Harvard University "Ready for the networked world" (Readiness for the Networked World) and Russian realities which is relevant to the assessment: human capital, business climate and using of ICT in culture. It appears to the "effect resource economy." It is most clearly seen when comparing the two global markets: the global oil market which is estimated at 650 billion dollars, (Russia's share in it - 16%); ICT world market - about $1 trillion share in it represents the hundredths of a percent (Vaganov, 2004).
The impact which formed of global information society on international relations has not only positive but also negative effects. Thus, the importance of international cooperation is often less important for the media industry, which allows for requests of the audience. Everywhere we are seeing a decline in international news programs, very costly and have a constant audience for stories related to the consumption and criminal chronicle (Atlas Monde diplomatique, 2007). Media increasingly contribute to the formation of world opinion, laying patterns to assess the achievements of globalization as well as risks and challenges of globalization.
For example, growth media publications about the terrorist threat is much ahead of terrorist activity in the world (Chernikov, 2002). However, there is no sufficient information on such global issues as water crisis, or human trafficking. All this points are need for the transformation of information policy.

== Unrecognized states ==

The list of current [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized states]] in scientific publications is large. It includes the Republic of China on Taiwan and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Often can be added the Republic of Somaliland, Tamil Eelam (Ceylon), and more recently - the Islamic State of Waziristan, whose independence was proclaimed in February 2006. Occasionally in this context refers to Southern Sudan, Kashmir, Western Sahara, Palestine, Kurdistan and some other areas (e.g. exotic Sealand). 
Consequently, the unrecognized state -  it is the common name of public entities who are possessing all the attributes of statehood (control of territory, control system, the actual sovereignty) at the same time deprived of full or partial international diplomatic recognition and thus can not de jure act as in international relations. They should not be confused with self-declared republics (- it is education, which is itself declared, but no more). Some authors believe that the term of "unrecognized state" - incorrect (they believe that unrecognized state - is education that passed even though the short period of statehood, it ended in failure) and prefer the term "State de facto".
International legal conflict between the right of nations and self-determination are enshrined in the famous decision of the [[UN General Assembly]] on decolonization in 1960. The principle of territorial integrity of States -  is the principle of inviolability of borders which is officially recognized by all European countries, USA and Canada in the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Conference on Security and Cooperation]] in Europe in Helsinki in 1975.
Uncertainty state by the international community negatively affects its legal status and operational capabilities. Such a state can not be in active economic activities can not conclude trade contracts and implement multilateral investment and infrastructure projects. The area relies only on the international community to humanitarian aid, social and cultural projects, cooperation with various countries and regions in its infancy. Thus the political and legal recognition of any territory depends for its existence and development.
Top prospects in terms of possible transformations is the current status of Kosovo. It is about independence in some form, as this concerned the United States and the European Union. Apparently, Serbia will only be able to postpone such a decision or to bargain for themselves some political and economic concessions (integration of Serbia into the EU or Kosovo section). On the other hand, if the recognition of Kosovo be qualified as a unique case (a unique case) it could provoke a serious precedent in countries where the problem of ethnic separatism.
Abkhazia, Transnistria and South Ossetia can rely on partial, incomplete recognition of Russia, but their future prospects far from obvious. This "half independence" will not be recognized by the United States, European Union, India, China and many other countries. There is the slightest chance of changing the status of Nagorno Karabakh. This situation is mainly determined by the position of the US, EU, Russia, Iran and Turkey.
To effectively address the problem of unrecognized states is likely to develop the clear international legal criteria under which after a certain period unrecognized state formation can count on international recognition.
With all the reservations can be stated that unrecognized independent state players are the regional and international politics. Their influence on political processes is quite noticeable. Globalization has created additional opportunities for long-term existence of unrecognized states without their formal recognition by other countries. It is gradually becoming the norm.

'''Global studies''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[political]], [[economic]], [[legal]], [[ecological]] and [[cultural]] interconnectedness. Predominant subjects are [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on an international level. Global studies is oriented around the study of [[globalization]] as it relates to intercontinental politics, the global economy, international law, market relations, the movement of people and resources, global communications, the effect of human activity on the environment, and many more topics. Global studies is often used to map global change and is both [[Microeconomics|micro]] and [[Macroeconomics|macro]] in scope. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines global studies as ''"the study of political, economic, and social situations in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge English Dictionary: Global Studies|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/global-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global studies tackles the aforementioned topics by examining global power structures influenced by perspectives such as [[Orientalism]] and [[Eurocentrism]]. Global studies is distinguished from international studies by its broader focus – [[international studies]] is only one aspect of global studies. In cases such as international studies or [[international relations]], the concept of 'national' confines the meaning of those fields of study. By comparison, global studies has a broader reach, from the global to the local.

== History and context ==
{{See also|Globalization}}
The development of global studies in secondary and tertiary education is arguably a product of globalization, and its consequent results on the international community. In the late 20th century, an unprecedented rise in communications technologies and computerization occurred around the world, again enhancing the processes of globalization: “it is a shift in our very life circumstances ... the speed of change is closely allied to the growth of communication, and development in information and communication technologies have been exponential ... globalization is a fact of life from which we cannot retreat.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The consequences of modernity|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this constantly changing global community, education providers began to see a need for the introduction of global studies into secondary school curricula (i.e. introduction of  [[global issues]]  through already existing subjects), and to create global studies degrees for tertiary students (i.e. sole degrees with a global focus).

According to Jan Nederveen Pieterse, Mellichamp Professor of Global Studies and Sociology at The University of California, Santa Barbara:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first Global Studies conference took place at the University of Illinois Chicago in 2008; the 2009 conference was held in Dubai on the theme Views from Dubai: The Gulf and Globalization. The 2010 conference was in Busan, South Korea under the heading Global Rebalancing: East Asia and Globalization; the 2011 conference took place in Rio de Janeiro on Emerging societies and Emancipation; the 2012 conference was at Moscow University on the theme of Eurasia and  Globalization: Complexity  and Global studies; and the 2013 conference took place in New Delhi on the theme of Social Development in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/assets/downloads/global/E14FinalProgram.pdf|title=Seventh Global Studies Conference Program|last=|first=|date=|website=onglobalization.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Global Studies Journal was founded in 2008 and is "devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/journal|title=Journal – Global Studies Research Network|website=onglobalization.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of global studies ==

=== Global vs. international studies ===
There can be much confusion about the use of the terms, "global studies" and "international studies."

They are at times used interchangeably and differences in meaning are not evident, however, both disciplines are concerned with political, social and cultural issues, with the main focus of study being placed on international community interaction. However, subtle distinctions can be made between the two phrases. International studies generally looks at exchanges between states, multilateral or bilateral agreements, diplomacy and how issues are handled between two or more states. Global studies, in contrast, focuses on globally shared issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalstudies.unc.edu/masters/|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that there are [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] connotations to each phrase, international studies being preferred by the right wing (i.e. relations between states) and global studies preferred by the left (i.e. issues affecting all global citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Andrew|title=Liberal Theories of International Relations: A Primer|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/publications.html|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms have also been described as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;International studies might be called the grandfather of global education. It often includes the study of countries, world religions, languages and international relations ... (global studies) is centred on the concept of connectedness – recognizing local/ global connections, the commonalities all humans share, and how understanding how national borders have become practically irrelevant for many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;Merryfield, M 2004 ‘The importance of a global education,’ ''Outreach World'', viewed 5/10/10 at: http://www.outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103229/http://outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Five defining characteristics of global studies were identified by scholars at the first annual meeting of the [[Global Studies Consortium]] in Tokyo in 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXhfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Conference+2008+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAnRbWAD4e&amp;sig=3h2899QfrUezZ9coblAqlLLTUfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5Izjj_HKAhVF7yYKHchxBpcQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Conference%202008%20Tokyo&amp;f=false ''Thinking Globally: A Global Studies Reader'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:transnational|Transnational]]
* [[Interdisciplinary]]: global studies scholarship can involve politics, economics, history, geography, anthropology, sociology, religion, technology, philosophy, health as well as the study of the environment, gender, and race.
* [[Contemporary]] and [[historical]] examples range from the transnational activity of the Greek and Roman Empires to modern European colonialism.
* [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] and [[Critical theory|Critical]]: global studies often emphasizes a postcolonial perspective, and attempts to analyze global phenomena through a critical, multicultural lens.

== Subjects of interest ==
The field of global studies revolves around the impacts of globalization and the growing interdependence of states, economies, societies, cultures, and people. This necessitates that students are well versed and capable of critical analysis when it comes to global issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Education Policies and Practices," Peace Corps. {{cite web |url=http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612210639/http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the most pressing issues in global studies are [[national security]] and [[diplomacy]], effective [[citizenship]] in a [[participatory democracy]], global [[competitiveness]] in a world market and the desire to enter the aid and development sector.

=== National security ===
The first major funding for international education was the 1966 International Education Act in the US.  It provided funding to institutions of higher education to create and strengthen international studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Digest for Education Statistics, 2004 – Chapter 4: Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities." National Center for Education Statistics (2004), http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/ch_4.asp, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Created at the time of the [[Cold War]], this act stressed the need for all citizens (with a focus on USA citizens) to understand global issues in order to build skills for diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;International Education Act: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, Eighty-Ninth Congress, Second Session on S. 2874 and H.R. 14643. Publication date: 1966, Accessed through ERIC, http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED093756&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED093756.&lt;/ref&gt;”The importance of diplomacy as a driving force for political development is well known and understood. It is of great importance as a long term instrument for conflict prevention.”&lt;ref&gt;Skylakakis, T 2010, ‘The importance of economic diplomacy,’ The Bridge Magazine, viewed 24/9/10 at:  http://www.bridgemag.com/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of issues and crisis on a global scale such as international terrorism, climate change and environmental degradation, pandemics (such as ebola), and the [[Great Recession]] have convinced policymakers of the importance of global studies and international education to national security and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korry, Elaine. "Bush Expected to Hike Funding for Language Training," National Public Radio Broadcast, January 5, 2006, Accessed online https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global economy ===

A second motivation for global studies is facilitating a better understanding of the [[global marketplace]].  Many international companies have identified the need for a workforce that has the skills to work cross-culturally and identify and serve the needs of a global market.&lt;ref&gt;Groennings, Sven. "Economic Competitiveness and International Knowledge.  A Regional Project on the Global Economy and Higher Education in New England.  Staff Paper II."  New England Board of Higher Education. October 28, 1987. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Some international companies, such as Microsoft, have taken the lead in convening policymakers and key stakeholders to demand additional investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;"ECS, ISTE and [[Microsoft]] to Sponsor Global Education Competitiveness Summit." http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/jun09/06-23gecs2009nrpr.mspx, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US state and federal governments have also placed global studies as a key priority for preparing a competitive workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Putting the World into World Class Education.  West Virginia Department of Education. http://wvconnections.k12.wv.us/documents/GlobalAwarenessPresentation062408_001.ppt, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2002 the Australian federal government (through its development body AusAID) used some of its funding to introduce a ‘Global Education Program.’ This program aims to increase understanding of development and international issues among Australian students. It provides teachers with professional development opportunities with NGOs and thorough curriculum support. The program “informs and encourages teachers to introduce students to global issues in a classroom setting.”&lt;ref&gt;Gallus, C 2002 ‘Global Studies Statement Launch,” AusAID, viewed 2/10/10 at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923153626/http://ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions have closely followed with integrating international studies across disciplines.  It is rare to find a leading business school without an international focus.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. http://www.hbs.edu/global/, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Business School. http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925054608/http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml |date=2009-09-25 }}, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global citizenship and rights ===
A third motivation for global studies is the creation of an effective citizenry.  In the US, the National Council of Social Studies states that the purpose of social studies is to “teach students the content knowledge, intellectual skills, and civic values necessary for fulfilling the duties of citizenship in a participatory democracy.”  A key goal of the NCSS is “global education”.&lt;ref&gt;"About National Council for the Social Studies." The National Council for Social Studies, http://www.socialstudies.org/about, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As globalization causes the lines between national and international to become blurred, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to understand global relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Lapayese, Yvette. "Review:Toward a Critical Global Studies Education" Comparative Education Review, Vol. 47, No. 4 (Nov., 2003), pp. 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of effective [[Global citizenship]] results in people who are willing to, and have the capacity to become involved in local and global issues. In the UK, local government research conducted in the surrounding areas of London has found that citizens must have the opportunity to become involved and then possess the skill, knowledge and confidence to take part. The outcomes are often very positive, leading to an improvement in services, better quality of democratic participation and community education.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Cowell, Downe, Martin 2006 ‘Promoting effective citizenship and community empowerment,’ Office of the Deputy PM, London, viewed at: {{cite web |url=http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725151250/http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
To achieve effective citizenship, students must be educated in ways that engage and place emphasis on the importance of global issues. By studying a subject such as global studies, students can gain the knowledge required to become effective citizens.

Some critical scholars note that beyond content, students must be taught "global cognition" in order to truly understand global perspectives.  These scholars believe that in order to fully understand world issues, students must recognize that their perspective is not necessarily shared by others and understand the social forces that influence their views.&lt;ref&gt;Hanvey, Robert. "An Attainable Global Perspective." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Charlotte. "Global Education in the Classroom." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 168–76&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives encourage engagement with new promises and threats for the promotion of human rights, social justice, and political participation.

=== International Institutions ===
By 2006, the international development sector had expanded exponentially, with the “NGO sector now being the 8th largest economy in the world ... employing nearly 19 million paid workers."&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Jones, P 2006, ‘The rise and rise of NGOs,’ Public Services International, viewed 23/9/10 at: http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122306/http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing health projects used to be the biggest issue in global aid, but private and public organizations like the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have helped overcome such problems. The issue now is making sure that the money is used in a proper manner to help those in need of the primary essentials of life.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Laurie. 2007. "The Challenge of Global Health," ''Foreign Affairs'' '''86''' (1):14-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying global studies may lead to involvement in the aid and [[International development|development]] sector in multiple ways. These can include working in post-conflict or natural disaster zones, improving public services in developing communities (health, education, infrastructure, agriculture) or aiding private sector growth through business and market models.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey International Development, 2010 ‘Work that makes a difference,’ Coffey, viewed 24/9/10 at: http://www.coffey.com/our-businesses/coffey-international-development/our-expertise/sectors/overview{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying global studies, students can be equipped with cross cultural knowledge, field experience and an awareness of global issues. Many students are now studying global studies in order to enter this sector.

== Learning outcomes and job prospects ==
Learning outcomes for global studies vary depending on the institutes curriculum and students individual focuses. Although, introductory courses are designed to cover a wide range of topics in a single semester, students are expected to delve into a specific phenomenon or area of study for their academic career.   there are some generic outcomes that students are expected to develop over the duration of study. These include, but are not limited to:
*Cultural awareness
*Ability to analyze the interconnectedness of the global and local
*Skills in ethical research and analysis with specific policy implications
*Awareness of current affairs
*Ability to communicate effectively in a range of situations
*Increase in cross cultural competence
*potentially improve proficiency in a foreign language

Global studies scholars are eligible for a myriad of professions, tackling political, social, and economic issues on an international scale that work to improve the human condition.
*International relations
*Foreign affairs
*NGOs
*Local, national, and international government 
*Environmental research
*Historical Analysis

'''[[Globalization]]''' allowed interaction between countries and the global market and has grown economies to higher levels. It is a highly debated subject and there is a great deal to be discussed about it. One perspective on this worldwide movement is the Christian (religious) point of view. First of all, Christians believe in a higher authority, and aim to model their lives in obedience to their God. That being said, they value community and ultimately care for all the people their God has created. That is on a global scale, not only local. They feel a responsibility to the poor, and encourage globalization as it provides more opportunities for countries with weak economies that struggle with poverty. Work is valuable and there is importance in working in a global economy.

There are three main approaches to this topic from this perspective. There is the Evangelical Approach, Catholic Social teaching, and the Non-Evangelical Perspective.

==Evangelical approach==
The evangelical approach focuses on the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ through globalization. Globalization opens many doors to many countries, and this perspective looks at that as an opportunity. It is an opportunity to spread the Christian teaching through the doors that have been opened. In this context globalization is seen as a tool, a stepping stone towards achieving the evangelical goal.

==Catholic social teaching==
The Catholic social teaching looks at globalization with the aim of improving it. Improving it in the sense that they desire to shift the focus to a more humanitarian goal. Thomas Friedman wrote that, "the more I observed the system of globalization at work, the more obvious it was that it had unleashed forest-crushing forces of development and Disney-round-the-clock homogenization which, if left unchecked, had the potential to destroy the environment and uproot cultures at a pace never before seen in human history." in his book ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' In this perspective, globalization is not viewed as a positive development, but can be seen as a way to reach more people and create a more socially conscious global environment.

==Non-evangelical perspective==
The non-evangelical perspective highlights the benefits of globalisation through reach. It emphasizes the number of people now more easily contacted and the cultures more easily understood. In this view the focus is not the spread of the gospel but the connecting of the "body of Christ" on a global level. It is basically the universal church being more easily unified through the barriers broken down by globalization.

Much of the information in the image come from a single remote-sensing modevice—[[NASA]]'s Moderate Resolution Imaging [[Spectroradiometer]], or MODIS, flying over 700 km above the Earth on board the [[Terra satellite]] in 2001.]]

The [[prehistory of the Americas]] ([[North America|North]], [[South America|South]], and [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]]) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an [[Ice Age]]. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the "[[Old World]]" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492.

The ancestors of today's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indigenous peoples]] were the [[Paleo-Indians]]; they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the [[Americas]] via [[Beringia]], the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the [[Bering Strait]]. Small [[lithic stage]] peoples followed [[megafauna]] like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname "big-game hunters." Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.

Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as [[Iroquois]] on North America and [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] of South America. These cultures later developed into [[civilization]]s. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} advanced or civilized include [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], [[Cahokia]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Toltec]], [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Chimor]], [[Mixtec]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]], [[Puebloan]], [[Totonac]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Huastec people]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Izapa]], [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and the [[Inca]].{{Human history}}After the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and later [[British Empire|English]], [[French Colonial Empire|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day [[Southwestern United States]], [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day [[Brazil]] while England established colonies on the [[Thirteen Colonies|Eastern coast of the United States]], as well as the [[Northwestern United States|North Pacific coast]] and in most of [[Canada]]. France settled in [[Quebec]] and other parts of Eastern [[Canada]] and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.

European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (376 million speakers), [[English language|English]] (348 million) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when [[Brazil]] and the larger [[Hispanic America]]n nations declared independence. The [[United States]] obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as [[Guyana]] obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and [[French Guiana]] remain part of a European power to this day.

&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the [[Beringia|Beringia land bridge]] between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 – 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the [[Quaternary glaciation]].&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|first1=Drs.

New studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought"&lt;ref name=Raghavan&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature12736 |last1= Raghavan |first1= Maanasa |author2=Pontus Skoglund, Kelly E.

First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia." A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the [[Solutrean hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Ancient&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Siberian genome reveals genetic origins of Native Americans|url=http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/11062/20131121/dna-study-reveals-first-native-americans-may-have-come-from-siberia.htm|publisher=PHYSORG|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=Nov 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithic stage]] or ''[[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]]'', is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the [[Late Pleistocene]] epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of "[[Lithic flake]]d" stone tools. [[Stone tool]]s, particularly [[projectile point]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the [[Americas]]. [[Lithic reduction]] stone tools are used by [[archaeologists]] and [[anthropologist]]s to classify cultural periods.

===Archaic stage (8000 BCE – 1000 BCE)===
{{see also|Pre-Columbian era|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}
Several thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle [[Archaic stage|Archaic period]] around 6000 BCE. Particular [[archaeological culture]]s can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.

In the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the [[Norte Chico civilization]], also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradle of civilization|five sites]] where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican [[Olmec]] civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under [[Narmer]] and the emergence of the first [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].

Monumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.

Ongoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.

The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, [[Michael E. Moseley]] contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed "maritime foundation of Andean Civilization" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).

While earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]] at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added [[avocado]], [[Canna (plant)|achira]], and [[corn]] (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.&lt;ref name=HaasPNAS2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Haas | first1= Jonathan | author2= Winifred Creamer, Luis Huamán Mesía, David Goldstein, Karl Reinhard, and Cindy Vergel Rodríguez | year = 2013 | title = Evidence for maize (Zea mays) in the Late Archaic (3000–1800 B.C.) in the Norte Chico region of Peru |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 13 |pages = 4945–4949 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1219425110 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1219425110 |accessdate = 2013-11-20 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences of the United States |quote=New data drawn from coprolites, pollen records, and stone tool residues, combined with 126 radiocarbon dates, demonstrate that maize was widely grown, intensively processed, and constituted a primary component of the diet throughout the period from 3000 to 1800 B.C. | pmid=23440194 | pmc=3612639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotton]] was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish."

In the 2005 book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date "sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at [[Huaricanga]] in the (inland) Fortaleza area.

The Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.

After the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: [[Chavín culture|Chavin]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Quitus]], [[Cañari]]s, [[Chimu]], [[Pachacamac]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Inca]] in the Central [[Andes]] (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in Colombia ; [[Taínos]] in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Española) and part of Caribbean; and the [[Olmec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], [[Aztec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).

The [[Olmec]] civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|six sites]] around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.

Some elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The [[Maize#Origin|domestication of maize]] is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/I/20035654.html |title=Agriculture's origin may be hidden in 'invisible' clues |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.

The Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.

Cities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec empire]]. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, [[Cahokia]], located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.

These civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding [[maize]] (corn) from having ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to perhaps 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm in length. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[chocolate]] are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the [[Andes]]. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley after introduction from [[Mexico]]. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]].

{{main|Iroquois}}
The [[Iroquois|Iroquois League of Nations]] or "People of the Long House", based in present-day upstate and western [[New York (state)|New York]], had a [[Confederation|confederacy]] model from the mid-15th&amp;nbsp;century.  It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=33 questions about American history you're not supposed to ask |first=Thomas E |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMcnBRKR-0C&amp;pg=PA62 |last= Woods |page=62|publisher=Crown Forum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-34668-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=R |year=2005 |title=Stolen Continents: 500 Years of Conquest and Resistance in the Americas |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=0-618-49240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooker"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: Cultural Fictions and Government Policies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107|publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |year=1990 |pages=107–128 |chapter=The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1|author=Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 [[sachem]] [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, each representing one [[clan]] within a tribe; the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Mohawk people]] had nine seats each; the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] held fourteen; the [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] had ten seats; and the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [[Veto|veto power]]. The Onondaga were the "[[firekeeper]]s", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Elizabeth Tooker, an [[anthropologist]], has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, or in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century [[Beaver Wars]].&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |publisher=Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture |accessdate=2010-11-29 |last=Burns |first=LF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102050914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The Osage warred with [[Caddo]]-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

Chichimeca was the name that the [[Aztec|Mexica]] (Aztecs) generically applied to a wide range of semi-[[nomad]]ic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day [[Mexico]], and carried the same sense as the European term "[[barbarian]]". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples of northern Mexico.

====Mesoamerica====
{{main|Mesoamerica}}

;Zapotec
The [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]].

;Olmec
The [[Olmec]] civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in [[Mesoamerica]] and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.

;Purepecha
The [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] civilization emerged around 1000 CE in [[Mesoamerica]] . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of [[Michoacán]]. Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.

;Maya
{{main|History of the Maya civilization}}
[[Maya civilization|Maya]] history spans 3,000 years. The [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya]] may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.

;Toltec
The [[Toltec]] were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.

;Teotihuacan
[[Teotihuacan]] (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.

;Aztec
The [[Aztec]] having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.

;Norte Chico
The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico]] region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The [[Quipu]], a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.

;Chavín
The [[Chavín]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.

;[[Inca]]
Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.
Known as ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[Trepanning|trepanation]] of the skull in Inca civilization.

Around 1000, the [[Vikings]] established a short-lived settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.

Spain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492; it quickly led to extensive [[European colonization of the Americas]]. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.

===Colonial period===

===Decolonization===
{{details|Decolonization of the Americas}}
The formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] lasted through the period of the [[Siege of Yorktown]] — its last major campaign — in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]].
 
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José de San Martín]], among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]]. (See [[Latin American integration]].) In the Portuguese colony [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.

As a part of the [[British Empire]], Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] attacks at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]]. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in [[conscription]], despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of [[French Canadians]]. In the ensuing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], riots broke out on the streets of [[Montreal]]. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]].

The United States stayed out of the conflict [[American entry into World War I|until 1917]], when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] that shaped [[interwar]] Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.

{{further|Roaring Twenties|Great Depression|Cristero War}}

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] combined with [[dust bowl|drought]] ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and [[Great Depression in Canada|Canada]]. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].

Once again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a "[[superpower]]".

{{further|History of the United States (1945–64)|History of Canada (1945–60)|Civil rights movement}}

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the emergence of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as ''"El Milagro Mexicano"'' (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of [[decolonization]], while on the largest island the [[Cuban Revolution]] introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.

{{further|History of the United States (1964–80)|History of Canada (1960–81)}}

The [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S. ended [[Jim Crow]] and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant [[New Deal coalition]] collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the [[Vietnam War]], and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed]]. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.

{{further|History of the United States (1980–91)|History of Canada (1982–92)}}

Canada's [[Brian Mulroney]] not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] in January 1989. Mexican presidents [[Miguel de la Madrid]], in the early 1980s and [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of [[privatization]] and [[regulation]] to stimulate the economy.

{{further|History of the United States (1991–present)|History of Canada (1992–present)}}

The end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, [[Vicente Fox]] became the first non-[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the [[9/11]] attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in [[Afghanistan]], which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], however.

In the U.S. the [[Reagan Era]] of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the [[Late-2000s recession]] with prolonged unemployment.

{{main|History of Central America}}
{{see also|History of Belize|History of Costa Rica|History of El Salvador|History of Guatemala|History of Honduras|History of Nicaragua|History of Panama}}
Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856&amp;ndash;1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

In 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] ("CACM"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 "[[Football War]]" between El Salvador and Honduras. A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

===South America===
{{see also|History of South America}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States [[Cold War]] doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and a leftist president in Argentina and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the [[Union of South American Nations]], South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">'''Ideoscape''' is a term used to describe one of [[Arjun Appadurai]]’s five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of [[ethnoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[Financescape|financescapes]], and '''ideoscapes'''. The suffix -''scape'' denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. Because cultural exchange and transactions have typically been restricted in the past due to geographical and economical aspects, Appadurai’s five dimensions give the opportunity for cultural transactions to occur. '''Ideoscapes''' is the movement of ideologies. It is often political and usually has to do with the ideologies of states and the counterideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lechner|first1=Frank|last2=Boli|first2=John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-1-118-73355-4|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ideoscapes''' are usually composed of ideas, terms, and images including “freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation, and democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Infectious Disease Research Institute''' ('''IDRI''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Seattle]], in the United States, and which conducts [[global health]] research on [[infectious diseases]].

==History==
IDRI was founded in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria vaccine==
IDRI is collaborating with the [[United States Agency for International Development]] to develop a [[malaria vaccine]] with the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] using Walter Reed's CelTOS malaria antigen in conjunction with IDRI's GLA-SE [[adjuvant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/usaid-idri-form-malaria-vax-collaboration/2011-08-18 |title=USAID, IDRI form malaria vax collaboration |author=Erica Teichert  |work=fiercevaccines.com |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visceral leishmaniasis vaccine==
On February 2012, IDRI launched the world’s first [[clinical trial]] of the [[visceral leishmaniasis]] vaccine.  The vaccine is a recombinant form of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins with an [[adjuvant]].  Two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers are to be conducted.  The first one takes place in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and is followed by a trial in [[India]].  The trials are funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/worlds-first-kala-azar-vaccine-enters-clinic/2012-02-23|title=World’s first kala azar vaccine enters the clinic|author=Elvidge, Suzanne|publisher=FierceVaccines.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation''' ('''IHME''') is a research institute working in the area of [[global health]] statistics and impact evaluation at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle. The Institute is headed by Dr. [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], a physician and health economist, and professor at the [[University of Washington Department of Global Health]], which is part of the [[School of Medicine]]. IHME's goal, as stated on the Institute's website, is "to identify the best strategies to build a healthier world. By measuring health, tracking program performance, finding ways to maximize health system impact, and developing innovative measurement systems, IHME provides a foundation for informed decision-making that ultimately will lead to better health globally" IHME (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Heath Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/research|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IHME conducts research and trains scientists, policymakers, and the public in health metrics concepts, methods, and tools. Its mission includes judging the effectiveness and efficacy of health initiatives and national health systems. IHME's work seeks to be complementary to the [[United Nations]]' work in the [[World Health Organization]] in that it shares many tasks but is independent from member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNiel|first1=Donal|title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=New York Times|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Seattle institute aims to help cure world-health data disorder|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-institute-aims-to-help-cure-world-health-data-disorder/|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle Times|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHME gathers health-related data from all available sources. It develops innovative analytical tools to track trends in mortality, diseases, and risk factors, and capsulizes many of its research findings in data visualizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Visualizations|url=http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates interventions such as vaccines, malaria control policies, cancer screenings, and birth care. To enable researchers to replicate IHME's work and to foster new research, IHME created the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) where methods and results are cataloged and freely accessible. IHME is also committed to expanding the field of health metrics by training students at the post-baccalaureate and post-graduate levels.

==History==

IHME was launched in June 2007 based on a core grant of $105 million primarily funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its earliest projects was to produce new estimates of mortality rates, which were published in ''The Lancet'' in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CJL|last2=Laakso|first2=T|last3=Shibuya|first3=K|last4=Lopez|first4=AD|title=Can we achieve Millennium Development Goal 4?

==Research==
IHME also has launched policy reports on a wide range of topics, including a June 2010 report on child and maternal mortality. The findings were updated in 2014. In 2009, IHME launched its series of Financing Global Health policy reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravishankar|first1=N|last2=Gubbins|first2=P|last3=Cooley|first3=RJ|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Michaud|first5=CM|last6=Jamison|first6=DT|last7=Murray|first7=CJL|title=Financing of global health: tracking development assistance for health from 1990 to 2007|journal=The Lancet|date=20 June 2009|volume=373|pages=2113–2124|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60881-3|pmid=19541038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=C|last2=Schneider|first2=MT|last3=Gubbins|first3=P|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Jamison|first5=D|last6=Murray|first6=CJL|title=Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=17 April 2010|volume=375|pages=1375–1387|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60233-4|pmid=20381856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial report led to meetings with staff from the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and with a task force appointed by US President Barack Obama to guide the funding of his new Global Health Initiative. Annual updates have been published since then.

Recent publications have included estimations of causes of death worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-age-sex-specific-all-cause-and-cause-specific}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incidence of HIV, TB, and malaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-and-mortality-hiv-tuberculosis-and-malaria |date=July 2014 |first1=Christopher J.L. |last1=Murray |first2=Theo |last2=Vos |first3=Alan |last3=Lopez |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as obesity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-prevalence-overweight-and-obesity-children-and-adults}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960460-8/abstract|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8|volume=384|year=2014|pages=766–781 | last1 = Ng | first1 = Marie|pmc=4624264}}&lt;/ref&gt; cigarette smoking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996- 2012|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/cigarette-smoking-prevalence-us-counties-1996-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporal trends in ischemic heart disease mortality in 21 world regions, 1980-2010: the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/temporal-trends-ischemic-heart-disease-mortality-21-world-regions-1980-2010-global}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small area estimation of diabetes rates in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srebotnjak|first1=T|last2=Mokdad|first2=AH|last3=Murray|first3=CJL|title=A novel framework for validating and applying standardized small area measurement strategies|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=29 September 2010|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/8/1/26|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-8-26|volume=8|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also worked with other organizations on projects. For example, IHME researchers helped create the 2010 WHO World Malaria Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO: World Malaria Report 2010|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating all the estimates for insecticide-treated nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260|year=2010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also collaborated on country-level research projects, including a partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help create a health surveillance system to track disease trends and inform policy. 
There is a list of publications at IHME's website.

===Global Burden of Disease===
{{further|Global Burden of Disease Study}}

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2010, a worldwide consortium of 500 researchers, coordinated by IHME measured the impact of more than 290 health conditions and 67 health risk factors worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The story of GBD 2010: a "super-human" effort|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2962174-6/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBD enterprise produced estimates in 21 regions around the world for disability-adjusted life years by age and sex for the past two decades. Part of this research has involved conducting in-person surveys in several countries and gathering health information through a website survey. The team created a cause of death database that includes 60 years of data, or almost 800 million deaths. To illustrate the findings, IHME released a suite of interactive data visualizations, which are available to the public.

The aim is to allow policymakers and other decision-makers to "compare the effects of different diseases – such as cancer versus depression – that kill people prematurely and cause ill health," to show disease trends over time, and to inform policy, IHME states on its website.

It has been labeled "the most comprehensive review of the state of humanity's health ever undertaken."&lt;ref name="2013_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Gates, UW teaming up on massive health study|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/gates-uw-teaming-up-on-massive-health-study/ |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and China are among the countries working with IHME to generate subnational burden of disease estimates at the county and province levels.

In January 2014, IHME began releasing updates to the work, called the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2013. The work generated over 1 billion estimates of health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GBD History|url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBD estimates are now being updated annually.

Some of the findings have been controversial. In 2012, IHME researchers estimated 1.2 million people died from malaria in 2010, double the WHO's estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New estimates of malaria deaths: concern and opportunity|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960169-X/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60169-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelland|first1=Kate|title=Analysis: Health by numbers: A statistician's challenge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-statistics-idUSBRE84D0KD20120514 |accessdate=January 25, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease Control Priorities Network===

{{further|Disease Control Priorities Project}}

The Disease Control Priorities Network project generates cost-effectiveness estimates for a range of health interventions. A team of demographers, statisticians, economists, and other experts are studying how to improve the allocation of resources among interventions, technologies, hospitals, and other service delivery platforms. They are working in multiple countries, including the US, India, and South Africa.
Their cost-effectiveness work has revealed some hidden connections. For example, a 2010 report showed improving girls' education in poor countries is the most effective way to reduce child mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=18 September 2010|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was a surprise for some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Paul|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effort launched in 2011 called Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) involves collecting evidence and analyzing data to improve the cost-effectiveness and equity of health systems in Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Uganda, and Zambia. The project examines four components that affect health care delivery: access (to health facilities), bottlenecks (limitations on the supply side), costs, and equity (across populations). The work includes in-depth facility surveys and inventories across a range of service delivery platforms; additional data is collected in countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens through exit interviews and chart extraction.

A 2013 report concluded that neonatal and maternal mortality in Ghana could be best improved not with sophisticated maternity care but with better transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel time to maternity care and its effect on utilization in rural Ghana: a multilevel analysis|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/travel-time-maternity-care-and-its-effect-utilization-rural-ghana-multilevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population Health Metrics Research Consortium project===
The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium created new methods for tracking health intervention coverage in low-resource settings. The methods have been used to measure mortality, causes of death, and incidence of major illnesses where data are incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Health Metrics Research Consortium gold standard verbal autopsy validation study: design, implementation, and development of analysis datasets|url=https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/population-health-metrics-research-consortium-gold-standard-verbal-autopsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers collected data in India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Tanzania.

IHME's work on estimating mortality has been at times controversial. In 2009, IHME published a study on maternal mortality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=MC|last2=Foreman|first2=KJ|last3=Naghavi|first3=M|last4=Ahn|first4=SY|last5=Wang|first5=M|last6=Makela|first6=SM|last7=Lozano|first7=R|last8=Lopez|first8=AD|last9=Murray|first9=CJL|title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5|journal=The Lancet|date=8  May 2010|volume=375|pages=1609–1623|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60518-1|pmid=20382417}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some advocacy groups tried to suppress – worried that results showing a decline in mortality would make it harder to fund-raise. The WHO also initially disagreed with the new results, but later revised their estimates in agreement with those of IHME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria Control Policy Assessment project===

The Malaria Control Policy Assessment project evaluates the effectiveness of malaria-control interventions in Uganda and Zambia by analyzing their effect on child mortality and producing estimates at the national and local levels.

===United States public health research===

IHME conducts US research, including estimates of mortality, life expectancy, risk factors, health disparities, and disease prevalence. IHME has compiled national and local health trends and integrated multiple data sources to monitor disparities in chronic diseases.

A 2013 report, the State of US Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of US Health: Innovations, Insights, and Recommendations from the Global Burden of Disease Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/policy-report/state-us-health-innovations-insights-and-recommendations-global-burden-disease-study|website=IHME}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at trends in premature deaths due to injury or disease, and demonstrated the major health threat stemming from behavioral risk factors such as poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. It concluded that dietary factors cause more deaths each year than cancer or smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The State of US Health, 1990-2010 Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors|journal=JAMA|date=10 July 2013|volume=310|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1710486|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.13805|pages=591–608|pmid=23842577|pmc=5436627 | last1 = Murray | first1 = CJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results included life expectancy trends broken down by state and county.

First Lady Michelle Obama cited the research in her campaign to improve Americans' diets and increase their level of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Diet Important For Increasing Years of Healthy Life, New Study Says|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/blog/2013/07/11/healthy-diet-important-increasing-years-healthy-life-new-study-says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in the journal Population Health Metrics in June 2011 showed that life expectancy was rising in some poorer US counties – especially in the South&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=SC|last2=Levin-Rector|first2=A|last3=Ezzati Murray CJL.|first3=M|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Falling behind: life expectancy in US counties from 2000 to 2007 in an international context|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=15 June 2011|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/9/1/16|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-9-16|volume=9|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a surprising result which was widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pallarito|first1=Karen|title=Life expectancy in U.S. trails top nations|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/15/life.expectancy.united.states/|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=CNN|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research projects include the Salud Mesoamérica 2015 Initiative, which focuses on inequalities in health outcomes and access in southern Mexico and Central America; Gavi Full Country Evaluations, which evaluates immunization programs in Bangladesh, India, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia; and HealthRise, a partnership with Medtronic Philanthropy to evaluate programs targeting diabetes and heart disease, and sponsor small grants to make improvements.

In 2014, IHME announced the establishment of the University of Washington Center for Demography and Economics of Aging, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). It is one of 14 NIA Demography Centers at leading universities and policy organizations around the United States.

===Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx)===

In March 2011, IHME launched the Global Health Data Exchange (or GHDx), which indexes and hosts information about microdata, aggregated data, and research results with a focus on health-related and demographic datasets. At launch, the site listed about 1,000 datasets; as of 2015, there are more than 30,000. As part of a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), GHDx includes 35 years of CDC data on child and maternal health. GHDx uses the Drupal 7 open source content management system and Apache SOLR for search. The site includes visualization and GIS tools, and has been noted by the health and global health communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dam|first1=Andrew|title=Institute launches global health data clearinghouse|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2011/04/institute-launches-global-health-data-clearinghouse/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree Programs==
IHME offers two types of global health fellowships, plus master's degrees and PhD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Programs in Health Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthdata.org/get-involved/degree-programs|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funders==
IHME receives core grant funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates' gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Washington. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Inter-American Development Bank; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health; Medtronic Philanthropy; and the National Institute on Aging have also contributed funding through project grants and contracts.

==Reception==

Initially, some within the [[World Health Organization]] had criticized IHME for trying to do the work that WHO already does. There had also been tension between [[UNICEF]] and IHME because a report from the latter showed "lackluster progress" on child death rates.&lt;ref name="2008_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The 2010 Global Burden of Disease report was criticized for its lack of transparency of methods and data as well as its use of complex statistical methods to fill in data gaps when reliable statistics were unavailable. Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], called for more transparency. The report was also criticized for its use of [[Verbal autopsy|verbal autopsies]] because many diseases have similar symptoms, leading to potential mistakes.&lt;ref name="2013_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/verbal-autopsy |title=Verbal Autopsy (VA) |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Rudan and Kit Yee Chan argue that the emergence of IHME introduced competition to the field of global health metrics, which was previously a field where WHO maintained a monopoly: "The GBD initiative has emerged as a well-organised and rapidly growing collaboration that is now seriously challenging WHO's role in generating global health estimates".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3406781/RudanComment2013GBD.pdf |first1=Igor |last1=Rudan |first2=Kit Yee |last2=Chan |title=Global health metrics needs collaboration and competition |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62006-7 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=385 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudan and Chan also note that IHME "struggled to generate support, legitimacy, and acceptable for their findings" after publishing the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, due to concerns of lack of transparency, as well as the existence of parallel estimates of disease burden from WHO.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

The World Health Organization did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2013 expanded collaboration and increased transparency but "[fell] short of allowing full independent replication of all results".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

The '''International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association''' ('''IBMA''') is the worldwide association of the [[biocontrol]] industry, with its head office in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/team Webpage IBMA Team 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The association sponsors the [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]] held in [[Basel]], Switzerland.

== History ==
In 1995, the IBMA was founded in [[Brighton]] (England), whose founding president was [[Bernard Blum]]. In his honour the Bernard Blum Award was launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/bernard-blum-award Webpage Bernard-Blum-Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728184804/http://www.ibma-global.org/en/bernard-blum-award |date=2016-07-28 }} requested on 27. July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBMA presidents have been: Michel Guillon, Denise Munday, Owen Jones and Willem Ravensberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/upload/attach-image/ibmanewsletterabim2015.pdf Information of Willem Ravensberg concerning IBMA-Presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The association sees itself representing the manufacturers of biocontrol products mainly within the [[European Union]], the OECD, and FAO.

In workshops, the experiences of the members is to be exchanged, in particular at the annual [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting|ABIM Congress]] in [[Basel]].

In contrast to the chemical crop protection industry (Agricultural Industry Association) the IBMA members produce [[Bioeffector]]s, i.e. botanicals, pheromones, invertebrate biocontrol agents and micro-organisms as a basis for plant protection products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma-global.org/en/professional-groups IBMA product groups]&lt;/ref&gt; These biocontrol products against plant diseases and pests are created that can be used in the organic production of food as well as in IPM production systems.

Although the products sold produce general Pflanzenvitalisierung, so the aim of the group is yet to fight specific diseases and pests in plants and food production with biological systems. In European politics promotion of organic vegetable production increases greatly. The organization makes a significant contribution with their members' products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8605">The '''International Sanitary Conferences''' were a series of 14 conferences, the first of them organized by the French Government in 1851 to standardize international quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever. In total 14 conferences took place from 1851 to 1938; the conferences played a major role in the formation of the [[World Health Organization]] in 1948.

==Background==
The outbreak of the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|Second cholera pandemic]] in 1829, prompted European Governments to appoint medical missions to investigate the causes of the epidemic. Among others, the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Royal Academy of Medicine of Paris]] in June 1831, sent [[Auguste Gérardin]] ([[:fr:Auguste Gérardin|fr]]) and [[Paul Gaimard]] on medical mission to [[Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the [[Minister of Commerce and Industry (France)|Minister of Commerce]] of France, appointed the Secretary of the [[Conseil supérieur de la santé]], [[P. de. Ségur-Dupeyron]] with the task of creating a report on the sanitary regulations
of the [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean countries]]. The report published in 1834, pointed to the differing quarantine requirements among the countries, and proposed to convene an international conference to standardise quarantine requirements against exotic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1951 - It was adopted by WHO as International Sanitary regulations.
*1969 - WHO modifies the regulations as ([[International Health Regulations]]).

===Paris, 1851===
The first International Sanitary Conference opened in Paris on July 23, 1851. A total of twelve countries participated including [[Austria]], [[Great Britain]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Turkey]] and the four Italian Powers of [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]]; each country being represented by a pair of a physician and a diplomat.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|pp=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference revolved around the question of whether or not cholera should be subject to quarantine regulations. The Papal States, Tuscany, the Two Sicilies, Spanish, Greek, and Tuscan delegates supported quarantine measures against cholera with Sardinia, Austria, Britain, and France opposing quarantine measures.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

The Austrian medical delegate, G. M. Menis along with [[John Sutherland (physician)|John Sutherland]], the British
medical delegate and Anthony Perrier, the British diplomatic delegate were most vocal against quarantine measures with the Spanish medical delegate, [[Pedro F. Monlau]] ([[:es:Pedro Felipe Monlau|es]]) and the Russian medical delegate, Carlos O. R. Rosenberger in the opposite camp.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

The Conference participants agreed on a draft Sanitary Convention and annexed draft International Sanitary
Regulations consisting of 137 articles.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

===Paris, 1859===
The second International Sanitary Conference opened in Paris on April 9, 1859. Except the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], all twelve countries of the first Conference were present.&lt;ref&gt;The outbreak of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War of 1859]] prompted the Austrian delegate to withdraw on 30 April on but he later attended between 20th-30th August&lt;/ref&gt; The conference which lasted for five months, resulted in Austria, France, Great Britain, the Papal States, Portugal, Russia, Sardinia, and Spain signing the slightly amended "draft convention" (itself a combination of the convention and the annexed international sanitary
regulations agreed on the first conference) with Greece and Turkey abstaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|pp=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the "'''largest [[naval battle]] in history'''" is disputed between adherents of different criteria which include the numbers of personnel and/or vessels involved in the battle, and the total tonnage of the vessels involved. While battles fought in modern times are comparatively well-documented, the figures from those in pre-Renaissance times are generally believed to be exaggerated by contemporary chroniclers.

==The candidates==
* '''[[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]''', September (28?) 480 BC. 371 [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ships defeated 300–600 [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] ships in this decisive battle. Greek [[trireme]]s had a crew of about 200 while their small [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconters]] had 50 oarsmen.
* '''[[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]]''', 256 BC. One of [[Roman Republic|Rome's]] first major naval victories over its rival, the city of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], in the [[First Punic War]]. The battle itself involved around 680 ships and 300,000 personnel from both sides. Total casualties were about 40,000–50,000, of which roughly 10,000 were on the Roman side and the rest from the Carthaginian side.
*'''[[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]]''', winter of 208 AD. A decisive naval engagement between the forces of [[Cao Cao]] and the allied forces of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], this battle resulted in the defeat of Cao Cao and confirmed the separation of China into northern and southern halves, the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze River Valley]] as a border. Between 270,000 and 850,000 personnel participated in this battle.
*'''[[Battle of the Masts]]''', 654 AD. The Battle of the Masts, or the Battle of [[Finike]] (Phoenix), was an engagement involving the [[Byzantine Empire]], with 500 ships and led personally by Emperor [[Constans II]], and the newly formed navy of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], commanded by Admiral [[Abu'l-Awar]], with 200 ships. The Byzantines hastily attacked, resulting in a decisive victory for the Arabs. Emperor Constans II barely escaped with his life, and this battle marked the emergence of Arabs on the Mediterranean. 
* '''[[Battle of Yamen|Yamen]]''', March 19, 1279. The battle which ended the Mongol-led [[Yuan Dynasty]]'s conquest of [[Southern Song Dynasty]]. It is claimed that more than 1,000 [[Song Dynasty]] warships were destroyed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] near Yamen, [[Guangdong]], China.
*  '''[[Battle of Lake Poyang|Lake Poyang]]''', August 30&amp;ndash;October 4, 1363. Claimed to be the largest naval battle in terms of personnel, with a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved. A [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rebel force, said to be 200,000 strong, commanded by [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], met a [[Han (people)|Han]] rebel force, claimed to be 650,000-strong, commanded by [[Chen Youliang]], on [[Lake Poyang]], China's largest freshwater lake.
* '''[[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]''', May 31&amp;ndash;June 1, 1916. The Imperial German Navy's [[High Seas Fleet]] commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and the British [[Grand Fleet]] under [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Sir John Jellicoe]] engaged in battle near Jutland, Denmark during World War I. The German fleet consisted of 16 [[dreadnought]] and 6 [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships, 5 [[Battlecruiser|battle cruisers]], 11 [[light cruiser]]s, and 61 fleet torpedo boats, while the numerically superior British fleet was composed of 28 battleships, 9 battle cruisers, 8 [[Armored cruiser|armoured cruisers]], 26 light cruisers, 78 destroyers, 1 [[minelayer]], and 1 [[Seaplane tender|seaplane carrier]]. Britain lost more ships and twice as many men as Germany, although ultimately the outcome was beneficial for the British as the battle resulted in the successful containment of the German fleet. In terms of total tonnage of ships involved, this was the largest surface battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Naval Sea Battles in Military History|url=http://militaryhistory.norwich.edu/largest-naval-sea-battles-in-military-history/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]]''', June 19–20, 1944. The largest aircraft carrier battle in history, involving fifteen U.S. [[Fleet carrier|fleet]] and [[Light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine Japanese carriers, 170 other warships and some 1,700 aircraft.  In terms of tonnage, the U.S. Fifth Fleet's [[Task Force 58]] is the largest single naval formation ever to give battle.
* '''[[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]]''', October 23&amp;ndash;26, 1944. The largest in terms of [[tonnage]] of ships in the combined orders of battle, if not necessarily in terms of tonnage of the ships engaged; it is also the largest in terms of the tonnage of ships sunk, and in terms of the size of the area within which the component battles took place. The [[United States]] [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third]] and [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh]] Fleets, including some [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] warships, comprised 8 large [[aircraft carrier]]s, 8 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], 18 [[escort carrier]]s, 12 [[Battleship#World War II|battleship]]s, 24 [[cruiser]]s, 141 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, many other ships, and around 1,500 aircraft. They won a decisive victory over [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, which consisted of 1 large [[aircraft carrier]], 3 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine battleships, 19 cruisers, 34 destroyers and several hundred aircraft. The opposing fleets carried a total of about 200,000 personnel. Leyte Gulf consisted of four major subsidiary battles: [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], [[Battle of Samar]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Engaño (25–26 October)|Battle of Cape Engano]], along with other actions. These are counted together by virtue of their all being caused by the Japanese operation ''Sho-Go'', which was aimed at destroying the Allied amphibious forces involved in the [[Battle of Leyte|invasion of Leyte]]. However, the individual battles were separated by distances as great as two hundred miles, as well as several days time, from the first submarine action to the Japanese withdrawal.

This is a list of the world's '''longest wooden ships'''. The vessels are sorted by ship length including [[bowsprit]], if known.

Finding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.

A further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the "length of the topmost deck" – the "length on deck" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the "length between perpendiculars" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including [[jibboom]] and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The longest length for comparing ships, the total "[[Length overall|overall]]" length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.

The longest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted New England gaff schooner ''Wyoming'', had a "total length" of {{convert|137|m|ft}} (measured from tip of jib boom (30 metres) to tip of spanker boom (27 metres) and a "length on deck" of {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}-difference is due to her extremely long jib boom of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} her out-board length being {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

'''Nuclear power''' is the use of [[nuclear reaction]]s that release [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]] to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in [[steam turbine]]s to produce electricity in a [[nuclear power plant]]. 
Nuclear power can be obtained from [[nuclear fission]], [[nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. 
Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].
Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.
The possibility of generating electricity from nuclear fusion is still at a research phase with no commercial applications.
This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation.

Nuclear power is one of the leading [[low carbon power generation]] methods of producing [[electricity]].
In terms of [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated]], nuclear power has emission values comparable or lower than [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Nrel.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html | title=Nuclear Power Results – Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization| quote=Collectively, life cycle assessment literature shows that nuclear power is similar to other renewable and much lower than fossil fuel in total life cycle GHG emissions. |publisher=nrel.gov |author= National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702205635/http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the beginning of its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power – global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning |doi=10.1021/es3051197 |pmid=23495839 |ref=harv|bibcode = 2013EnST...47.4889K |volume=47 |issue=9 |journal=Environmental Science |pages=4889–4895 |year=2013 |author=Kharecha Pushker A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,488 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) of electricity in 2017, equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation.&lt;ref name="iaea_pris" /&gt;
As of April 2018, there are [[List of nuclear reactors|449 civilian fission reactors in the world]], with a combined electrical capacity of 394 [[gigawatt]] (GW). 
Additionally, there are 58 reactors under construction and 154 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 63 GW and 157 GW, respectively. Over 300 more reactors are proposed.&lt;ref name=WNA&gt;{{cite web|title=World Nuclear Power Reactors {{!}} Uranium Requirements {{!}} Future Nuclear Power - World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of reactors under construction are of [[generation III reactor]] design, with the majority in Asia.&lt;ref name="iaea_pris" /&gt;

There is a social [[Nuclear power debate|debate about nuclear power]].
Proponents, such as the [[World Nuclear Association]] and [[Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]], contend that nuclear power is a safe, [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]].
[[Anti-nuclear movement|Opponents]], such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service|NIRS]], contend that nuclear power poses many threats to [[Environmental radioactivity|people and the environment]].

Some [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|accidents]] have occurred in nuclear power plants. 
These include the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the Soviet Union in 1986, the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan in 2011, and the more contained [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States in 1979.
There have also been some nuclear submarine accidents.
In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, nuclear reactors have caused the lowest number of fatalities per unit of energy generated when compared to the other major energy producing methods.
Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy, due to air pollution and [[Energy accidents|accidents]].&lt;ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|The [[Nuclear binding energy]] of all natural elements in the periodic table. Higher values translate into more tightly bound nuclei and greater nuclear stability. [[Iron]] (Fe) is the end product of [[nucleosynthesis]] within the core of [[hydrogen]] fusing stars. The elements surrounding iron are the [[fission products]] of the fissionable [[actinides]] (e.g. uranium). Except for iron, all other elemental nuclei have in theory the potential to be nuclear fuel, and the greater distance from iron the greater [[nuclear potential energy]] that could be released.]]
{{See also|Nuclear fission#History|Atomic Age}}
In 1932 physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that when lithium atoms were "split" by protons from a proton accelerator, immense amounts of energy were released in accordance with the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. However, he and other nuclear physics pioneers [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Albert Einstein]] believed harnessing the power of the atom for practical purposes anytime in the near future was unlikely, with Rutherford labeling such expectations "moonshine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/p1s2.shtml |title=Moonshine |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, his doctoral student [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/p1s1.shtml |title=The Atomic Solar System |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] to discover [[induced radioactivity]] in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebigger.com/chemistry/nuclear-and-radiation-chemistry/what-do-you-mean-by-induced-radioactivity-2/ |title=What do you mean by Induced Radioactivity? |author=taneya says: |publisher=Thebigger.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work by [[Enrico Fermi]] in the 1930s focused on using [[slow neutron]]s to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity. Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, transuranic element, which was dubbed [[hesperium]].&lt;ref name=Np&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/element.php?sym=Np |title=Neptunium |publisher=Vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, German chemists [[Otto Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/hahn-bio.html |title=Otto Hahn, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1944 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fritz Strassmann]], along with Austrian physicist [[Lise Meitner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/otto-hahn-lise-meitner-and-fritz-strassmann |title=Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, and Lise Meitner |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |publisher=Science History Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meitner's nephew, [[Otto Robert Frisch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_frisch-otto.htm |title=Otto Robert Frisch |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=Nuclearfiles.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170523/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_frisch-otto.htm# |archive-date=2017-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted experiments with the products of neutron-bombarded uranium, as a means of further investigating Fermi's claims. 
They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces, contradicting Fermi.&lt;ref name=Np/&gt; 
This was an extremely surprising result: all other forms of [[nuclear decay]] involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus, whereas this process—dubbed "fission" as a [[binary fission|reference to biology]]—involved a complete rupture of the nucleus. 
Numerous scientists, including [[Leó Szilárd]], who was one of the first, recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons, a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] could result. Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1939, scientists in many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of World War II, for the development of a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/introduction.shtml |title=The Einstein Letter |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First nuclear reactor===
In the United States, where Fermi and Szilárd had both emigrated, the discovery of the nuclear chain reaction led to the creation of the first man-made reactor, known as [[Chicago Pile-1]], which achieved [[Critical mass|criticality]] on December 2, 1942. 
This work became part of the [[Manhattan Project]], a massive secret U.S. government military project to make [[enriched uranium]] and by building large production reactors to produce (''breed'') [[plutonium]] for use in the first nuclear weapons. 
The United States would test an atom bomb in July 1945 with the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]], and eventually two such weapons were used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|left|The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at [[EBR-1]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne National Laboratory-West]], December 20, 1951.]]

In August 1945, the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy, in the form of the pocketbook ''The Atomic Age'', discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. 
Nobel laureate [[Glenn Seaborg]], who later chaired the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], is quoted as saying "there will be [[Nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles]], nuclear powered [[artificial heart]]s, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wendt |first1=Gerald |last2=Geddes |first2=Donald Porter |title=The Atomic Age Opens |date=1945 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York, NY |url=http://alsos.wlu.edu/information.aspx?id=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the [[EBR-I]] experimental station near [[Arco, Idaho]], which initially produced about 100&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml |title=Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Fast Reactor Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Reactor Makes Electricity."] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1952, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Work was also strongly researched in the United States on nuclear marine propulsion, with a test reactor being developed by 1953 (eventually, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]], the first nuclear-powered submarine, would launch in 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/lwr3.shtml#fragment-2 |title=STR (Submarine Thermal Reactor) in "Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Light Water Reactor Technology Development" |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1953, American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] gave his "[[Atoms for Peace]]" speech at the United Nations, emphasizing the need to develop "peaceful" uses of nuclear power quickly. This was followed by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954|1954 Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act]] which allowed rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector.

===Early years===
On June 27, 1954, the [[USSR]]'s [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a [[power grid]], and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power.&lt;ref name="IAEANews"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2004/obninsk.html |title=From Obninsk Beyond: Nuclear Power Conference Looks to Future |website=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WNA2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf45.htm |title=Nuclear Power in Russia |website=[[World Nuclear Association]] | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1954, [[Lewis Strauss]], then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (U.S. AEC, forerunner of the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]]) spoke of electricity in the future being "[[too cheap to meter]]".&lt;ref name="thisdayinquotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2009/09/too-cheap-to-meter-nuclear-quote-debate.html |title=This Day in Quotes: SEPTEMBER 16 – Too cheap to meter: the great nuclear quote debate |accessdate=2009-09-16 |publisher=This day in quotes |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Richard (1984) ''No Sacrifice Too Great: The Life of Lewis L. Strauss'' University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382 p. 187] {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; —which was secretly being developed as part of [[Project Sherwood]] at the time—but Strauss's statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission. The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before, projecting that "costs can be brought down... [to]... about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/?id=qBqbr8uV9c8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=strauss+son+cheap+meter | title= ''Nuclear Energy: Principles, Practices, and Prospects'' |author= David Bodansky |work= |publisher=Springer |page= 32 |doi= | accessdate= 2008-01-31 | isbn= 978-0-387-20778-0 | year= 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the United Nations' "First Geneva Conference", then the world's largest gathering of scientists and engineers, met to explore the technology. In 1957 [[EURATOM]] was launched alongside the [[European Economic Community]] (the latter is now the European Union). The same year also saw the launch of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).

One of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], for the purpose of propelling [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. The first nuclear-powered submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, was put to sea in December 1954.&lt;ref name = "iaeapdf"/&gt; As of 2016, the U.S. Navy submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear-powered vessels, with 75 submarines in service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Two U.S. nuclear submarines, {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}} and {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593|6}}, have been lost at sea.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] also had a [[Army Nuclear Power Program|nuclear power program]], beginning in 1954. The [[SM-1]] Nuclear Power Plant, at [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]], was the first power reactor in the United States to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid (VEPCO), in April 1957, before Shippingport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nab.usace.army.mil/portals/63/docs/FactSheets/FY15_Factsheets/VA-SM-1%20DNPPP.pdf|title=SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, VA|date=2015-02-01|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SL-1]] was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station]] in [[eastern Idaho]].

===Development===
[[File:Satsop Development Park 07780.JPG|thumb|[[Washington Public Power Supply System]] Nuclear Power Plants 3 and 5 were never completed.]]

Installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 [[gigawatt]] (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s, and 300 GW in the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly, reaching 366 GW in 2005. Between around 1970 and 1990, more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction (peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s) — in 2005, around 25 GW of new capacity was planned. More than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled.&lt;ref name="iaeapdf"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC48/Documents/gc48inf-4_ftn3.pdf |title=50 Years of Nuclear Energy |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of [[List of canceled nuclear plants in the United States|63 nuclear units were canceled]] in the United States between 1975 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C5W8uxwMqdUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=%22nuclear+power+industry%22+history+u.s.

During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernard L. Cohen |date=1990 |title=The Nuclear Energy Option: An Alternative for the 90s |url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter9.html |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-43567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive. In the 1980s (U.S.) and 1990s (Europe), flat load growth and [[electricity liberalization]] also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] had a significant effect on countries, such as France and Japan, which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation (39%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/stats/pdf_graphs/FRELEC.pdf |title=Evolution of Electricity Generation by Fuel }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(39.4&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 73% respectively) to invest in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Beder, '[http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/privatisation/japan.html The Japanese Situation]', English version of conclusion of Sharon Beder, "Power Play: The Fight to Control the World's Electricity", Soshisha, Japan, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Центр города Припять на фоне 4 энергоблокаа ЧАЭС.jpg|thumb|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]] with Chernobyl plant and the [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement]] arch, in the distance.]]

Health and safety concerns, the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident|accident at Three Mile Island]], and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries,&lt;ref name=wolfgang&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor1-last=Rüdig|title=Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXwfAQAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Longman Current Affairs|location=Detroit, MI|isbn=978-0-8103-9000-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the public policy organization, the [[Brookings Institution]] states that new nuclear units, at the time of publishing in 2006, had not been built in the United States because of soft demand for electricity, and [[cost overrun]]s on nuclear plants due to regulatory issues and construction delays.&lt;ref name="tbi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2004/09environment_nivola/pb138.pdf |title=The Political Economy of Nuclear Energy in the United States |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2004 |website=Social Policy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103011953/http://www3.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2004/09environment_nivola/pb138.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed. Eventually, more than 120 reactor orders in the United States were ultimately cancelled&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33442.pdf Nuclear Power: Outlook for New U.S. Reactors] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt. A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine commented on the overall failure of the U.S. nuclear power program, saying it "ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1985-02-11 |title=Nuclear Follies |journal=Forbes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Mile Island accident, the much more serious Chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting Western reactors since the Chernobyl reactors were of the problematic [[RBMK]] design only used in the Soviet Union, for example lacking "robust" [[containment building]]s.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html |title=Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] | accessdate = 2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these RBMK reactors are still in use today. However, changes were made in both the reactors themselves (use of a safer enrichment of uranium) and in the control system (prevention of disabling safety systems), amongst other things, to reduce the possibility of a duplicate accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf31.html |title=RBMK Reactors &amp;#124; reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny &amp;#124; Positive void coefficient |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international organization to promote safety awareness and professional development on operators in nuclear facilities was created: [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO).

Opposition in Ireland and Poland prevented nuclear programs there, while Austria (1978), Sweden (1980) and Italy (1987) (influenced by Chernobyl) voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power. In July 2009, the Italian Parliament passed a law that cancelled the results of an earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the Italian nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Italy rejoins the nuclear family | publisher = World Nuclear News | date = 2009-07-10 | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Italy_rejoins_the_nuclear_family_1007091.html | accessdate = 2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] a one-year moratorium was placed on nuclear power development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M504RG0.htm | title=Italy puts one year moratorium on nuclear | date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a referendum in which over 94% of voters (turnout 57%) rejected plans for new nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13741105 | work=BBC News | title=Italy nuclear: Berlusconi accepts referendum blow | date=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant}}
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, and a subsequent tsunami off the coast of Japan, the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] suffered multiple core meltdowns due to failure of the emergency cooling system for lack of electricity supply. This resulted in the most serious nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident prompted a re-examination of [[nuclear safety]] and [[nuclear energy policy]] in many countries&lt;ref name=sciamer2011/&gt; and raised questions among some commentators over the future of the renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-13/nuclear-renaissance-threatened-as-japan-fights-meltdown-at-quake-hit-plant.html Nuclear Renaissance Threatened as Japan’s Reactor Struggles] Bloomberg, published March 2011, accessed 2011-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/14/us-japan-quake-nuclear-analysis-idUSTRE72C41W20110314 Analysis: Nuclear renaissance could fizzle after Japan quake] Reuters, published 2011-03-14, accessed 2011-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power generation had the biggest ever fall year-on-year in 2012, with nuclear power plants globally producing 2,346 TWh of electricity, a drop of 7% from 2011. 
This was caused primarily by the majority of Japanese reactors remaining offline that year and the permanent closure of eight reactors in Germany.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=2013-06-20 |website=World Nuclear News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Fukushima===
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident sparked controversy about the importance of the accident and its effect on nuclear's future. 
The crisis prompted countries with nuclear power to review the safety of their reactor fleet and reconsider the speed and scale of planned nuclear expansions.&lt;ref name="Platts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6925550 |title=News Analysis: Japan crisis puts global nuclear expansion in doubt |date=2011-03-21 |publisher=Platts}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2011, ''The Economist'' opined that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-03-24 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Earth Institute Director Jeffrey Sachs disagreed, claiming combating climate change would require an expansion of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/nuclear-power-solution-climate-change|title=Nuclear power is only solution to climate change, says Jeffrey Sachs|first=Fiona|last=Harvey|date=3 May 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry as a response to the Fukushima accident.&lt;ref name=BBC18Sep2011&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-09-18 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Broder |date=2011-10-10 |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the construction of two additional reactors at the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]], the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident.&lt;ref name=yah12&gt;{{cite news | author=Hsu, Jeremy | date=2012-02-09 | title=First Next-Gen US Reactor Designed to Avoid Fukushima Repeat | url=https://news.yahoo.com/first-next-gen-us-reactor-designed-avoid-fukushima-005203660.html | publisher=Live Science (hosted on Yahoo!) | accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, [[Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station|Watts Bar 2]] became the first new United States reactor to enter commercial operation since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blau |first=Max |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/us/tennessee-nuclear-power-plant/index.html |title=First new US nuclear reactor in 20 years goes live |work=CNN.com |publisher=Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |date=2016-10-20 |accessdate=2016-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Japan signed a deal worth $22 billion, in which [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] would build four modern ''[[Atmea]]'' reactors for Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Prepares to Host First ATMEA 1 Nuclear Reactors |url=http://www.powermag.com/turkey-prepares-to-host-first-atmea-1-nuclear-reactors/ |work=PowerMag |publisher=Electric Power |accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August 2015, following 4 years of near zero fission-electricity generation, Japan began restarting its nuclear reactors, after [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Equipment, facility, and operational changes|safety upgrades were completed]], beginning with [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyuden.co.jp/en_information_150811.html |title=Startup of Sendai Nuclear Power Unit No.1 |date=2015-08-11 |website=Kyushu Electric Power Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, the IAEA's outlook for nuclear energy had become more promising. 
"Nuclear power is a critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions," the agency noted, and "the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the [Fukushima-Daiichi] accident...it is still the second-largest source worldwide of low-carbon electricity. 
And the 72 reactors under construction at the start of last year were the most in 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/january/taking-a-fresh-look-at-the-future-of-nuclear-power.html|title=January: Taking a fresh look at the future of nuclear power|website=www.iea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the World Nuclear Association, as of 2015 the global trend was for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]], "[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide/ Plans for New Reactors Worldwide]", October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, [[List of nuclear reactors|441 reactors]] had a worldwide net electric capacity of 382,9 GW, with 67 new nuclear reactors under construction.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_May_22_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/ten-new-nuclear-power-reactors-connected-to-grid-in-2015-highest-number-since-1990 |title=Ten New Nuclear Power Reactors Connected to Grid in 2015, Highest Number Since 1990 |accessdate= May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over half of the 67 total being built were in Asia, with 28 in [[China]], where there is an urgent need to control pollution from coal plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Nuclear Power {{!}} Chinese Nuclear Energy – World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the International Energy Agency reported that the Fukushima accident had a strongly negative effect on nuclear power, yet nuclear power prospects are positive in the medium to long term mainly thanks to new construction in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/january/taking-a-fresh-look-at-the-future-of-nuclear-power.html Taking a fresh look at the future of nuclear power], International Energy Agency, 29 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected for its “base case” that world nuclear power generation would increase from 2,344 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) in 2012 to 4,501 TWh in 2040. 
Most of the predicted increase was expected to be in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=31-IEO2016&amp;sourcekey=0 International Energy outlook 2016], US Energy Information Administration, accessed 17 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of nuclear power varies greatly between countries, depending on government policies. 
Some countries, many of them in Europe, such as Germany, Belgium, and Lithuania, have adopted policies of [[nuclear power phase-out]]. 
At the same time, some Asian countries, such as China&lt;ref&gt;James Conca, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/10/22/china-shows-how-to-build-nuclear-reactors-fast-and-cheap/#75c618694d0b "China shows how to build nuclear reactors fast and cheap"], ''Forbes'', 22 O ct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20160616-POWER-PERFORMERS-of-the-Asia300/Business/Nuclear-power-plant-builders-see-new-opportunities-in-India "Nuclear power plant builders see new opportunities in India"], Nikkei, 16 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; have committed to rapid expansion of nuclear power. 
Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/08/economist-explains-5 "The problem with Britain's (planned) nuclear power station"], ''The Economist'', 7 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States, have policies in between. 
Japan generated about 30% of its electricity from nuclear power before the Fukushima accident.
In 2015 the Japanese government committed to the aim of restarting its fleet of 40 reactors by 2030 after safety upgrades, and to finish the construction of the Generation III [[Ōma Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2018/03/19/japan-court-rejects-lawsuit-against-construction-of-nuclear-plant/&lt;/ref&gt; 
This would mean that approximately 20% of electricity would come from nuclear power by 2030.
As of 2018, some reactors have restarted commercial operation following inspections and upgrades with new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Japan|last=|first=|date=2016|website=World Nuclear Association|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are related to very strict safety requirements, uncertain regulatory environment, slow rate of construction, and large stretches of time with no nuclear construction and consequent loss of know-how.
Commentators therefore argue that nuclear power is impractical in western countries because of high costs, popular opposition, and regulatory uncertainty.&lt;ref name=jmc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/11/10/new-build-nuclear-is-dead-morningstar/ |title=New-Build Nuclear Is Dead: Morningstar |author=Jeff McMahon |date=2013-11-10 |work=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Quiggin"&gt;{{cite news |author=John Quiggin |date=2013-11-08 |title=Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

In 2016 the [[BN-800]] sodium cooled [[fast reactor]] in Russia, began commercial electricity generation, while plans for a [[BN-1200]] were initially conceived the future of the fast reactor program in Russia awaits the results from MBIR, an under construction multi-loop [[Generation IV]] research facility for testing the chemically more inert lead, lead-[[bismuth]] and [[gas cooled fast reactor|gas coolants]], it will similarly run on recycled [[MOX]] (mixed uranium and plutonium oxide) fuel. An on-site [[pyroprocessing|pyrochemical processing]], closed fuel-cycle facility, is planned, to reduce the necessity for a growth in uranium mining and exploration. In 2017 the manufacture program for the reactor commenced with the facility open to collaboration under the "International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycle", it has a construction schedule, that includes an operational start in 2020. As planned, it will be the world's most-powerful research reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/russia-starts-build-mbir-vessel-claire-louise-istedl|title=Russia starts to build MBIR vessel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. NRC and the U.S. Department of Energy have initiated research into [[Light water reactor sustainability]] which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond 60 years, provided that safety can be maintained, to increase energy security and preserve low-carbon generation sources.&lt;ref name="LifeAfter60"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energetics.com/nrcdoefeb08/pdfs/Life%20After%2060%20Workshop%20Report.pdf |title=NRC/DOE Life After 60 Workshop Report |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-04-01 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Nuclear power plant}}
{{see also|List of nuclear reactors}}
Just as many conventional [[thermal power station]]s generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from burning [[fossil fuels]], nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom via [[nuclear fission]] that takes place in a nuclear reactor. When a [[neutron]] hits the nucleus of a [[uranium-235]] or [[plutonium]] atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller nuclei. The reaction is called nuclear fission. The fission reaction releases energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more neutrons. This is called a [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. The reaction rate is controlled by [[Control rod|control rods]] that absorb excess neutrons. The controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction of neutrons resulting from fission are [[Delayed neutron|delayed]]. The time delay between the fission and the release of the neutrons slows down changes in reaction rates and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction rate.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics&gt;{{cite web |title=How does a nuclear reactor make electricity? - World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/how-does-a-nuclear-reactor-make-electricity.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atomic-age-began-75-years-ago-with-the-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction/|title=Atomic age began 75 years ago with the first controlled nuclear chain reaction|last=Spyrou|first=Artemis|date=2017-12-03|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-18|last2=Mittig|first2=Wolfgang|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fission nuclear power plant is generally composed of a [[nuclear reactor]], in which the nuclear reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat from inside the reactor; a [[steam turbine]], which transforms the heat in [[mechanical energy]]; an [[electric generator]], which transform the mechanical energy into electrical energy.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics /&gt;

Nuclear fission power stations, excluding the contribution from [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval nuclear fission reactors]], provided 11% of the world's electricity in 2012,&lt;ref name="oecd_pdf"&gt;{{Cite journal | url= https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf | title=Key World Energy Statistics 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-16 | publisher= [[International Energy Agency]] | year=2012 | format=PDF | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; somewhat less than that generated by [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric stations]] at 16%. 
Since electricity accounts for about 25% of humanity's energy usage with the majority of the rest coming from fossil fuel reliant sectors such as transport, manufacture and home heating, nuclear fission's contribution to the [[World energy consumption|global final energy consumption]] was about 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicola Armaroli]], [[Vincenzo Balzani]], ''Towards an electricity-powered world''.

Nuclear power's share of global electricity production has fallen from 16.5% in 1997 to about 10% in 2017, in large part because the economics of nuclear power have become more difficult.&lt;ref name=ft-20180903&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/fa6ca7ac-ab9a-11e8-89a1-e5de165fa619 |title=The challenge for nuclear is to recover its competitive edge |last=Butler |first=Nick |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 September 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
{{Main|Economics of nuclear power plants}}
[[File:Ikata Nuclear Powerplant.JPG|thumb|The [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant]], a [[pressurized water reactor]] that cools by utilizing a secondary coolant [[heat exchanger]] with a large body of water, an alternative cooling approach to large [[cooling towers]].]]
The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments depend on the choice of an energy source. 
Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs. 
Comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources. 
Cost estimates also need to take into account [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and [[nuclear waste]] storage costs. 
On the other hand, measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power |date=2009 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-update2009.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Splitting the cost |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2009/11/12/splitting-the-cost |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=12 November 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. 
To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[electric utility]] monopolies&lt;ref name=ft-20100912&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Crooks |date=2010-09-12 |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. 
In addition, because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great, the full cost of liability insurance is generally limited/capped by the government, which the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] concluded constituted a significant subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1983. The Price-Anderson Act: the Third Decade, NUREG-0957&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-615-12420-9 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nuclear power plants can vary their output, the electricity is generally less favorably priced when doing so. 
Nuclear power plants are therefore typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly base-load electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oecd-nea.org/nea-news/2011/29-2/nea-news-29-2-load-following-e.pdf Load-following with nuclear power plants by A. Lokhov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally the price of nuclear plants rose 15% annually in 1970–1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gore |first=Al |date=2009 |title=Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis |publisher=Rodale |location=Emmaus, PA |pages= |isbn = 978-1-59486-734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} 
Yet, nuclear power has total costs in 2012 of about $96 per megawatt hour (MWh), most of which involves capital construction costs, compared with solar power at $130 per MWh, and natural gas at the low end at $64 per MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 May 2015 |title=What does nuclear power actually cost #peakoil |url=http://northdenvernews.com/what-does-nuclear-power-actually-cost-peakoil/ |newspaper=North Denver News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are expected to increase for then-operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/nuclear-fuel-cycle/The_Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle-all.pdf |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2011 |website= |page=xv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle of nuclear fuel==
[[File:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|thumb|The nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel, (1) which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After usage in the power plant, the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to usage in a power plant (4).]]

{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}

A nuclear reactor is only part of the fuel life-cycle for nuclear power. 
The process starts with mining (see ''[[Uranium mining]]''). 
Uranium mines are underground, [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]], or [[in-situ leach]] mines. 
In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as [[yellowcake]], and then transported to a processing facility. 
Here, the yellowcake is converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is then generally [[uranium enrichment|enriched]] using various techniques. 
Some reactor designs can also use natural uranium without enrichment.
The enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% [[uranium-235]], is generally used to make [[Fuel rod#Common physical forms of nuclear fuel|rods]] of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. 
In modern light-water reactors the fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a [[spent fuel pool]] where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. 
After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.

In 2012 it was estimated that this fuel source could be extracted at 10 times the current price of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/ferguson2/|title=Uranium Extraction from Seawater|website=large.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, it was suggested that it would be economically competitive to produce fuel for light water reactors from seawater if the process was implemented at large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3390/jmse2010081|title=Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|volume=2|pages=81–92|year=2014|last1=Wang|first1=Taiping|last2=Khangaonkar|first2=Tarang|last3=Long|first3=Wen|last4=Gill|first4=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Uranium extracted on an industrial scale from seawater would constantly be replenished by both river erosion of rocks and the natural process of uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|dissolved]] from the surface area of the ocean floor, both of which maintain the [[Solubility equilibrium|solubility equilibria]] of seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeding===
{{Main|Breeder reactor|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy}}
As opposed to light water reactors which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium). In 2006 it was estimated that with seawater extraction, there was likely some five billion years' worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants.&lt;ref name="stanford-cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts From Cohen and Others |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=Stanford |year=2006 |author=John McCarthy |authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) |website=Progress and its Sustainability |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410165316/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |archivedate=2007-04-10 |df= }} Citing Breeder reactors: A renewable energy source, ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;51, (1), Jan.&amp;nbsp;1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeder technology has been used in several reactors, but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely, at 2006 technological levels, requires uranium prices of more than US$200/kg before becoming justified economically.&lt;ref name="wna-anpr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf08.html |title=Advanced Nuclear Power Reactors |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |website=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Breeder reactors are however being pursued as they have the potential to burn up all of the actinides in the present inventory of nuclear waste while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/p001515.pdf |title=Synergy between Fast Reactors and Thermal Breeders for Safe, Clean, and Sustainable Nuclear Power |website=World Energy Council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110121245/http://worldenergy.org/documents/p001515.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/are_fast-breeder_reactors_a_nuclear_power_panacea/2557/ |title=Are Fast-Breeder Reactors A Nuclear Power Panacea? by Fred Pearce: Yale Environment 360 |author=Rebecca Kessler |publisher=E360.yale.edu |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, there are only two breeder reactors producing commercial power: the [[BN-600 reactor]] and the [[BN-800 reactor]], both in Russia.&lt;ref name=WNAfast /&gt;
The BN-600, with a capacity of 600 MW, was built in 1980 in Beloyarsk and is planned to produce power until 2025.&lt;ref name=WNAfast&gt;{{cite web |title=Fast Neutron Reactors {{!}} FBR - World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The BN-800 is an updated version of the BN-600, and started operation in 2014 with a net electrical capacity of 789 MW.&lt;ref name=WNAfast/&gt;
The technical design of a yet larger breeder, the [[BN-1200 reactor]] was originally scheduled to be finalized in 2013, with construction slated for 2015 but has since been delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Large_fast_reactor_approved_for_Beloyarsk-2706124.html |title=Large fast reactor approved for Beloyarsk |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Phénix]] breeder reactor in France was powered down in 2009 after 36 years of operation.&lt;ref name=WNAfast /&gt;
Japan's [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] breeder reactor restarted (having been shut down in 1995) in 2010 for 3 months, but shut down again after equipment fell into the reactor during reactor checkups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201211090056 |title=Atomic agency plans to restart Monju prototype fast breeder reactor – AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |publisher=Ajw.asahi.com |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614042451/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201211090056 |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reactor was decommissioned in 2017.&lt;ref name=WNAfast/&gt;

Both China and India are building breeder reactors. 
The Indian 500 MWe [[Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor]] is in the commissioning phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prototype fast breeder reactor to be commissioned in two months: IGCAR director - Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/prototype-fast-breeder-reactor-to-be-commissioned-in-two-months-igcar-director/articleshow/61968967.cms |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plans to build five more by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/India-s-breeder-reactor-to-be-commissioned-in-2013/Article1-814183.aspx |title=India's breeder reactor to be commissioned in 2013 |publisher=Hindustan Times |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426141852/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/India-s-breeder-reactor-to-be-commissioned-in-2013/Article1-814183.aspx |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[China Experimental Fast Reactor]] began operating in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-10/31/c_131942867.htm |title=China makes nuclear power development – Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative to fast breeders is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from [[thorium]] as fission fuel in the [[thorium fuel cycle]].&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;
Thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the Earth's crust, and has different geographic characteristics.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;
This would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450%.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf62.html |title=Thorium |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |website=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[India's three-stage nuclear power programme]] features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage, as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;

===Nuclear waste===
{{details|Radioactive waste}}
[[File:Spent Fuel Storage (25865854820).png|thumb|left| The lifecycle of fuel in the present US system]]
{{See also|List of nuclear waste treatment technologies}}
The most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is [[spent nuclear fuel]]. 
It is primarily composed of unconverted uranium as well as significant quantities of transuranic actinides (plutonium and [[curium]], mostly). 
In addition, about 3% of it is fission products from nuclear reactions. 
The actinides (uranium, plutonium, and curium) are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity, whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. ''An Introduction to Nuclear Waste Immobilisation'', Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, 315pp. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-level radioactive waste====

Thermal reactors, which presently constitute the majority of the world fleet, cannot burn up the [[reactor grade plutonium]] that is generated efficiently, limiting the effective useful fuel life to a few years at most. Reactors in Europe and Asia are permitted to burn later refined [[MOX]] fuel, though the [[burnup]] is similarly not complete.]]

High-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power. The technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting, due to the extremely long periods [[radioactive waste]]s remain deadly to living organisms. Of particular concern are two [[long-lived fission product]]s, [[Technetium-99]] (half-life 220,000 years) and [[Iodine-129]] (half-life 15.7 million years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |title=Environmental Surveillance, Education and Research Program |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041307/http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |archivedate=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome [[Transuranium element|transuranic element]]s in spent fuel are [[Isotopes of neptunium|Neptunium-237]] (half-life two million years) and [[Plutonium-239]] (half-life 24,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenbosch|2007|p=21.|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the [[biosphere]]. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ojovan, M.

Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Brown, Paul| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/14/nuclear.greenpolitics|title=Shoot it at the sun.

Some proposed nuclear reactor designs however such as the American [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and the [[Molten salt reactor]] can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel, transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds, instead of tens of thousands of years.

Another possibility is the use of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium (rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium (i.e. in existing reactors). Used thorium fuel remains only a few hundreds of years radioactive, instead of tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;NWT magazine, October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each]] over the crust's 3 * 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; ton mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sevior M. |title=Considerations for nuclear power in Australia |journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.1080/00207230601047255 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a767886528 |format=PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121218195159/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-18|title=Thorium Resources In Rare Earth Elements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161.

====Low-level radioactive waste====
{{See also|Low-level waste}}

The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed as ordinary waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NRC: Low-Level Waste |url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html |website=www.nrc.gov |accessdate=28 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste relative to other types====
In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes account for less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which remains hazardous for long periods.&lt;ref name="wna-wmitnfc" /&gt; Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/TheRisksOfNuclearPower|title=The Challenges of Nuclear Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2007-12-13 |title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste |journal=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] equivalent, or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 times as much as from the operation of nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="colmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger |author=Alex Gabbard |date=2008-02-05 |website= |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |pages= |doi= |accessdate=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis, coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated, and this is released directly into the environment as [[fly ash]], whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials, for example, in [[dry cask storage]] vessels.&lt;ref name="cejournal"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2008-12-31 |title=Coal ash is ''not'' more radioactive than nuclear waste |url= http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |journal=CE Journal |pages= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827045039/http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |archivedate=2009-08-27 |dead-url=yes |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste disposal====

Reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95% of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new [[mixed oxide fuel]]. This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing had not been achieved as of 2013 because it requires breeder reactors, which were not commercially available at that time.&lt;ref name=berrytoll/&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fairley |first1=Peter |title=Nuclear Wasteland |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb07/4891 |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216161554/http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/4891# |archivedate=2007-02-16 |access-date=2007-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]], the potential vulnerability to [[nuclear terrorism]], the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. Several different methods for reprocessing been tried, but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation.&lt;ref name=berrytoll&gt;R.

====Depleted uranium====
{{Main|Depleted uranium}}

Uranium enrichment produces large amounts of [[depleted uranium]] (DU), which consists of U-238 with most of the easily fissile U-235 isotope removed. 
U-238 is a tough metal with several commercial uses including aircraft production, radiation shielding, and armor, as it has a higher density than lead. 
Depleted uranium is also controversially used in munitions; DU penetrators (bullets or [[APFSDS]] tips) "self sharpen", due to uranium's tendency to fracture along shear bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4004-safe-alternative-to-depleted-uranium-revealed.html | title= 'Safe' alternative to depleted uranium revealed

==Accidents, attacks and safety==
Nuclear reactors have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants. First, a very large amount of [[Radionuclide|radioactive]] materials is present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous. Second, a reactor has no "natural" power level. Rapid power increase is possible if the [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] cannot be controlled. Third, the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]] in the reactor continue to generate a significant amount of [[decay heat]] even after the chain reaction has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials. These three characteristics have to be [[Nuclear reactor safety system|taken into account]] when designing nuclear reactors. Multiple barriers separate the radioactive materials from the environment. Reactors are designed so that natural feedback mechanisms prevent an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power. Emergency cooling systems can remove the decay heat from the reactor in case the normal cooling systems fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ansn.iaea.org/ansn.org/Common/Documents/apmd/asia251p4.pdf|title=Basic principles of nuclear safety|last=Deitrich|first=L.W.|date=|website=|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe crop.jpg|thumb|Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], the world's worst [[nuclear accident]] since 1986, 50,000 households were displaced after [[radiation]] leaked into the air, soil and sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tomoko Yamazaki |author2=Shunichi Ozasa |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2011-06-27 |title=Fukushima Retiree Leads Anti-Nuclear Shareholders at Tepco Annual Meeting |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/fukushima-retiree-to-lead-anti-nuclear-motion.html |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mari Saito |date=2011-05-07 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protesters rally after PM call to close plant |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/07/us-japan-nuclear-idUSTRE74610J20110507 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Energy accidents|Nuclear safety|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}

Some serious [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|nuclear and radiation accidents]] have occurred. 
The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) introduced by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).
The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that pose no safety risk) to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects). 
There have been 3 accidents of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima accident]], are ranked at level 7.
The [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986 caused approximately 50 deaths from direct and indirect effects, and many more serious injuries.&lt;ref name=WHO2012&gt;{{cite web|date=23 April 2011|title=Chernobyl at 25th anniversary – Frequently Asked Questions – April 2011|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=14 April 2012|url=http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/20110423_FAQs_Chernobyl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact death toll due to indirect effects of the widespread radiation contamination is difficult to measure, and depends on the assumptions used. 
Some studies put the total death toll of the Chernobyl accident from indirect effects much higher, in the order of thousands of people.
The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident]] was caused by the [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]]. 
The accident has not caused any radiation related deaths, but resulted in radioactive contamination of surrounding areas.
The difficult [[Fukushima disaster cleanup]] will take 40 or more years, and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name="Richard Schiffman"&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Schiffman |date=2013-03-12 |title=Two years on, America hasn't learned lessons of Fukushima nuclear disaster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-accident-lessons-for-us |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Fackler"&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin Fackler |date=2011-06-01 |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 was a smaller scale accident, rated at INES level 5. 
There were no direct or indirect deaths caused by the accident.&lt;ref name=timenuke/&gt;

Other less serious accidents are more common. [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents (defined as either resulting in loss of human life or more than $50,000 of property damage) at nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=critev/&gt; 
Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 57% (56 out of 99) of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the United States.&lt;ref name=critev&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin K. Sovacool |date=August 2010 |title=A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a923050767~db=all~jumptype=rss |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=393–400 |doi=10.1080/00472331003798350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the [[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19]] reactor accident (1961),&lt;ref name="rad"/&gt; the [[Soviet submarine K-27|K-27]] reactor accident (1968),&lt;ref name="johnston2007"/&gt; and the [[Soviet submarine K-431|K-431]] reactor accident (1985).&lt;ref name="timenuke"/&gt;

According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, fission energy accidents ranked first among energy sources in terms of their total economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = B.

Another analysis presented in the international journal ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydroelectric accidents (primarily due to the [[Banqiao dam]] burst) have resulted in greater economic impacts than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref name="tandfonline1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgherr | first1 = P. | last2 = Hirschberg | first2 = S. | date = 2008 | title = A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains | url = http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf | journal = Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 947 | doi = 10.1080/10807030802387556 }} Page 962 to 965.

This study does not include Fossil fuel related cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption in its "severe accident", an accident with more than 5 fatalities, classification.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power works under an [[insurance]] framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the [[Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy|Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability]], the Brussels supplementary convention, the [[Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage|Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage]. [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]] in the United States.
It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity; but the cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the levelized cost of electricity, according to a CBO study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity] [[Congressional Budget Office]], May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
These beyond-regular-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf Availability of Dam Insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf|date=2016-01-08}} 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation. 
Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and [[hydropower]] has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and [[energy accidents]]. 
This is found when comparing the immediate deaths from other energy sources to both the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents&lt;ref name="without the hot air"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c24/page_168.shtml |title=Dr. MacKay ''Sustainable Energy without the hot air'' |website= Data from studies by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] including non EU data |page= 168 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also including the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear [[energy accidents]].&lt;ref name="theage2006"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nuclear-power-cheaper-safer-than-coal-and-gas/2006/06/04/1149359609052.html | title= Nuclear power 'cheaper, safer' than coal and gas |author= Brendan Nicholson |date= 2006-06-05 |work= |publisher= [[The Age]] |pages= |doi= | accessdate= 2008-01-18 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ with and without Chernobyl's total predicted, by the [[Linear no-threshold]], cancer deaths included.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. 
Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in Ukraine. 
A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew C.

[[Frank N. von Hippel]], an American scientist, commented on the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying that a disproportionate [[radiophobia]], or "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011 |volume= 67 |issue= 5 |journal= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 |doi=10.1177/0096340211421588 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2015 report in ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects.

===Attacks and sabotage===
{{Main|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Nuclear terrorism|Nuclear safety in the United States}}
Terrorists could target [[nuclear power plant]]s in an attempt to release [[radioactive contamination]] into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. An attack on a reactor's [[spent fuel pool]] could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.&lt;ref name=fas12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D. Ferguson |author2=Frank A. Settle |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |website=Federation of American Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity. 
New reactor designs have features of [[Passive nuclear safety|passive safety]], such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. 
However, these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group. 
The U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) does now also require new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt; 
In the United States, the NRC carries out "Force on Force" (FOF) exercises at all Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) sites at least once every three years.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt; 
In the United States, plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored. 
The plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/security-enhancements.html U.S. NRC: "Nuclear Security – Five Years After 9/11"]. Accessed 23 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Insider sabotage is also a threat because insiders can observe and work around security measures. 
Successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators' observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amacad.org/content/publications/pubContent.aspx?d=1427 |title=A Worst Practices Guide to Insider Threats: Lessons from Past Mistakes |author=Matthew Bunn |author-link=Matthew Bunn |author2=Scott Sagan|author2-link=Scott Sagan |last-author-amp=yes |date=2014 |publisher=The American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to New York's [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in 1971. 
The arsonist turned out to be a plant maintenance worker. 
Sabotage by workers has been reported at many other reactors in the United States: at [[Zion Nuclear Power Station]] (1974), [[Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Fort St. Vrain Generating Station]], [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant]] (1974), [[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant]] (1980), and [[Beaver Valley Nuclear Generating Station]] (1981). Many reactors overseas have also reported sabotage by workers.&lt;ref name="Amory Lovins 2001 145–146"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/BrittlePower/BrittlePower_Parts123.pdf |title=Brittle Power |author=Amory Lovins |author-link=Amory Lovins |date=2001 |pages=145–146 |access-date=2016-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402203813/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/BrittlePower/BrittlePower_Parts123.pdf# |archive-date=2016-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapon]]s if a country chooses to do so. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a "secret" weapons program. The concern over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear activities]] is a case in point.&lt;ref name=dfall2009&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author1=Steven E. Miller |author2=Scott D. Sagan |lastauthoramp=yes |date=Fall 2009 |journal=Dædalus |doi=10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7 |volume=138 |issue=4 |page=7 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2012 there were [[Nuclear power by country|thirty one countries]] that have civil nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html |title=Nuclear Power in the World Today |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine have nuclear weapons]], with the vast majority of these [[nuclear weapons state]]s having first produced weapons, before commercial fission electricity stations. 
Moreover, the re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the [[Non-proliferation treaty]], of which 190 countries adhere to.

A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=dfall2009/&gt; 
The [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] is an international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive [[nuclear fuel]] at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program. 
The France-based [[Eurodif]]/''European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium'' is a program that successfully implemented this concept, with [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]] and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/|title=Uranium Enrichment - Enrichment of uranium - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Iran was an early participant from 1974, and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via [[Sofidif]].

According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, a "number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; 
A 2009 United Nations report said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin K.

On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear weapons arsenals when military grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants.

Up to 2005, the Megatons to Megawatts Program had processed $8 billion of high enriched, weapons grade uranium into [[low enriched uranium]] suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors by diluting it with [[natural uranium]].
This corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |title=Megatons to Megawatts Eliminates Equivalent of 10,000 Nuclear Warheads |publisher=Usec.com |date=2005-09-21 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426130245/http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For approximately two decades, this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the United States (about half of all U.S. nuclear electricity generated) with a total of around 7 trillion [[kilowatt-hours]] of electricity produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dawn Stover |date=2014-02-21 |title=More megatons to megawatts |url=http://thebulletin.org/more-megatons-megawatts |journal=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough energy to energize the entire United States electric grid for about two years.&lt;ref name="A Farewell to Arms, 2014"/&gt; In total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion, a "bargain for US ratepayers", with Russia profiting $12 billion from the deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Much needed profit for the [[Rosatom|Russian nuclear oversight industry]], which after the collapse of the [[Soviet economy]], had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the Russian Federations highly enriched uranium and warheads.&lt;ref name="A Farewell to Arms, 2014"/&gt;

The Megatons to Megawatts Program was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name="thebulletin.org"/&gt; 
However without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
As of 2013 Russia appears to not be interested in extending the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-12-05 |title=Future Unclear For 'Megatons To Megawatts' Program |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is one of the leading [[low carbon power generation]] methods of producing [[electricity]], and in terms of [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated]], has emission values comparable to or lower than [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Nrel.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_results.html Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Results and Findings.Figure 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506114117/http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_results.html |date=2017-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2014 analysis of the [[carbon footprint]] literature by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) reported that the embodied [[Life cycle assessment|total life-cycle]] [[emission intensity]] of fission electricity has a median value of 12 g {{CO2}}[[carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kilowatt-hour|kWh]] which is the lowest out of all commercial [[baseload]] energy sources.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology – specific cost and performance parameters |year=2014 |publisher=IPCC |page=10 |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215013236/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report.mitigation2014.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. pg 37 to 40,41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908235241/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of [[nuclear power station|fission-electric power station]] commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895"/&gt;

===Radiation===
According to the United Nations ([[UNSCEAR]]), regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to 0.0002 [[millisievert]]s (mSv) per year of public exposure as a global average.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is small compared to variation in natural [[background radiation]], which averages 2.4&amp;nbsp;mSv/a globally but frequently varies between 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/a and 13&amp;nbsp;mSv/a depending on a person's location as determined by UNSCEAR.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt; 
As of a 2008 report, the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident (Chernobyl) is 0.002&amp;nbsp;mSv/a in global average exposure (a figure which was 0.04&amp;nbsp;mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986, although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers).&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt;

===Waste heat===
{{See also|Environmental impact of nuclear power#Waste heat}}
[[Climate change]] causing weather extremes such as [[heat waves]], reduced precipitation levels and [[droughts]] can have a significant impact on all [[thermal power station]] infrastructure, including large biomass-electric and fission-electric stations alike, if cooling in these power stations, namely in the [[steam condenser]] is provided by certain [[freshwater]] sources.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=2012-09-20 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; While many thermal stations use indirect seawater cooling or [[cooling tower]]s that in comparison use little to no freshwater, those that were designed to [[heat sink|heat exchange]] with rivers and lakes, can run into economic problems.

This presently infrequent generic problem may become increasingly significant over time.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This can force nuclear reactors to be shut down, as happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves. Nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river flow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage and forced the French government to import electricity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production only 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; 

If global warming continues, this disruption is likely to increase or alternatively, station operators could instead retro-fit other means of cooling, like [[cooling towers]], despite these frequently being large structures and therefore sometimes unpopular with the public.

==Comparison with renewable energy==
{{See also|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|100% renewable energy|Cost of electricity by source}}
There is an ongoing debate on the relative benefits of nuclear power compared to renewable energy sources for the generation of low-carbon electricity.
Proponents of renewable energy argue that wind power and solar power are already cheaper and safer than nuclear power.
Nuclear power proponents argue that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar do not offer the scalability necessary for a large scale decarbonization of the electric grid, mainly due to their intermittency.&lt;ref name=Kloor&gt;{{cite news |last=Kloor |first=Keith |date=2013-01-11 |title=The Pro-Nukes Environmental Movement |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html |work=Slate.com "The Big Questions" Blog |publisher=The Slate Group |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |date=2012-06-28 |title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0 |journal=IEEE Spectrum |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the majority of installed renewable energy across the world is currently in the form of [[hydro power]], solar and wind power are growing at a much higher pace, especially in developed countries.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Several studies report that it is in principle possible to cover most of energy generation with renewable sources.
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years with a necessary investment in renewables of about 1% of global GDP annually.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |author=Fiona Harvey |date=2011-05-09 |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt;

However, other studies suggest that solar and wind energy are not cost-effective compared to nuclear power.
The [[Brookings Institution]] published ''The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies'' in 2014 which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that "The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants", with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21608646-wind-and-solar-power-are-even-more-expensive-commonly-thought-sun-wind-and|title=Sun, wind and drain|publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Net-Benefits-Final.pdf|title=The net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies |date= May 2014 |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] | author=Charles Frank }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/6317|title=Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity-Generating Technologies|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=September 2011 |author= Paul Joskow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is also proposed as a tested and practical way to implement a low-carbon energy infrastructure, as opposed to renewable sources.
Analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely within 10 years, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.".&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], that is not solely electricity, but transportation [[synthetic fuels]] etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven installation rates in units of installed [[nameplate capacity]], [[Gigawatt|GW]] per year, per unit of global [[GDP]] (GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189 | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.041 | volume=42 | title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem?

This is in contrast to the conceptual studies for a ''[[100% renewable energy]]'' world, which would require an orders of magnitude more costly global investment per year, which has no historical precedent,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loftus  | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = A critical review of global decarbonization scenarios: what do they tell us about feasibility?  | url = | journal = WIREs Clim Change | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 93–112 | doi = 10.1002/wcc.324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loftus |first1=Peter J. |last2=Cohen |first2=Armond M. |last3=Long |first3=Jane C.

As Brook notes, the "principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

Several studies conclude that wind and solar power have costs that are comparable or lower than nuclear power, when considering price per kWh.
The cost of constructing established nuclear power reactor designs has followed an increasing trend due to [[regulation]]s and [[court cases]] whereas the [[LCOE|levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) is declining for wind and solar power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/wind-energy-costs-2-2012.pdf ] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021062622/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/wind-energy-costs-2-2012.pdf |date=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010 a report from Solar researchers at Duke University found that solar power may be already cheaper than new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Diana S.|title=Nuclear Energy Loses Cost Advantage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/global/27iht-renuke.html|work=The New York Times|date=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncwarn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwarn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/NCW-SolarReport_final1.pdf |title=Solar and Nuclear Costs — The Historic Crossover |date=July 2010 |website=NC WARN |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}} 
However they state that if subsidies were removed for solar power, the crossover point would be delayed by years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news200578033.html |title=Is solar power cheaper than nuclear power? |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data from the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) in 2011 estimated that in 2016, solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice as expensive as nuclear (21¢/kWh for solar, 11.39¢/kWh for nuclear), and wind somewhat less expensive than nuclear (9.7¢/kWh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity_generation.html |title=Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011 |date=November 2010 |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092151/http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity_generation.html |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the EIA has also cautioned that levelized costs of intermittent sources such as wind and solar are not directly comparable to costs of "dispatchable" sources (those that can be adjusted to meet demand), as intermittent sources need costly large-scale back-up power supplies for when the weather changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/conference/2013/pdf/presentations/namovicz.pdf |title=Assessing the Economic Value of New Utility-Scale Renewable Generation Projects |author=Chris Namovicz |date=2013-06-17 |website=US Energy Information Administration Energy Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by the Global Subsidies Initiative compared global relative [[energy subsidies]], or government financial aid for the deployment of different energy sources.
Results show that fossil fuels receive about 1 U.S. cents per kWh of energy they produce, nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents / kWh, renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) receives 5.0 cents / kWh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents / kWh in subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |title= Relative Subsidies to Energy Sources: GSI estimates 19 APRIL 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513055956/http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |archivedate= 13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/eia-releases-new-subsidy-report-subsidies-for-renewables-increase-186-percent/|title=Press release: EIA Releases New Subsidy Report: Subsidies for Renewables Increase 186 Percent - IER|date=3 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is comparable to, and in some cases lower, than many renewable energy sources in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered.&lt;ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="without the hot air"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starfelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230434/http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Economic Analysis of Various Options of Electricity Generation – Taking into Account Health and Environmental Effects |author1=Nils Starfelt |author2=Carl-Erik Wikdahl |accessdate=2012-09-08 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as opposed to renewable energy, conventional designs for nuclear reactors produce intensely radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Biello |date=2009-01-28 |title=Spent Nuclear Fuel: A Trash Heap Deadly for 250,000 Years or a Renewable Energy Source? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-waste-lethal-trash-or-renewable-energy-source |journal=Scientific American |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A nuclear plant also needs to be disassembled and removed and much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste for a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/yearbook/2012/pdfs/UYB_2012_CH_3.pdf |title=Closing and Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants |date=2012-03-07 |website=United Nations Environment Programme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518164428/http://www.unep.org/yearbook/2012/pdfs/UYB_2012_CH_3.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear decommissioning==
{{main|nuclear decommissioning}}
The financial costs of every nuclear power plant continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as [[greenfield status]]. 
After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for interim storage or [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but it has the potential to be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for [[human error]], accidents or sabotage.&lt;ref name=sov11/&gt;

In the United States a [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]] and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund is legally required, with utilities banking 0.1 to 0.2 cents/kWh during operations to fund future decommissioning. They must report regularly to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) on the status of their decommissioning funds. About 70% of the total estimated cost of decommissioning all U.S. nuclear power reactors has already been collected (on the basis of the average cost of $320 million per reactor-steam turbine unit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities.aspx|title=Nuclear Decommissioning: Decommission nuclear facilities - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/decommissioning.html|title=Backgrounder on Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants. NRC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 2011, there are 13 reactors that had permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning.&lt;ref name=sov11&gt;{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin K. Sovacool |date=2011 |title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |location=Hackensack, NJ |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|title-link=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station]] having completed the process in 2006–2007, after ceasing commercial electricity production circa 1992. 
The majority of the 15 years, was used to allow the station to naturally cool-down on its own, which makes the manual disassembly process both safer and cheaper.
Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming.

Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a [[sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]] and increases [[energy security]] by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aXb5iuqdZoD4&amp;refer=us U.S. Energy Legislation May Be 'Renaissance' for Nuclear Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182130/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103 |date=2009-06-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and fusion appear promising for [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] applications, generating higher mission velocities with less [[reaction mass]]. This is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions: some 7 orders of magnitude (10,000,000 times) more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets.

[[Radioactive decay]] has been used on a relatively small scale (few kW), mostly to power [[space mission]]s and experiments by using [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those developed at [[Idaho National Laboratory#Space and Security Power Systems Facility|Idaho National Laboratory]].

==Research==

===Advanced fission reactor designs===
{{Main|Generation IV reactor}}
[[File:GenIVRoadmap-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Generation IV roadmap from [[Argonne National Laboratory]]]]
Current fission reactors in operation around the world are [[generation II reactor|second]] or [[generation III reactor|third generation]] systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired. 
Research into advanced [[generation IV reactor]] types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste, improve natural resource utilization, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, and decrease the cost to build and run such plants. 
Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear |title=4th Generation Nuclear Power — OSS Foundation |publisher=Ossfoundation.us |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design. 
Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. 
He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; 
As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin K.

===Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission===
{{main|Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid}}
Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. 
Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.

Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist. 
The largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in progress is [[ITER]], a large [[tokamak]] under construction in France.
ITER is planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain. 
Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. 
The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=2013-12-30 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |url=http://www.nature.com/news/triple-threat-method-sparks-hope-for-fusion-1.14445 |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]], has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ITERorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |website=The ITER Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archivedate=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }} – Projected fusion power timeline&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFDA_Activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |title=Overview of EFDA Activities |website=[[European Fusion Development Agreement|EFDA]] |publisher=[[European Fusion Development Agreement]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archivedate=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2006-11-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of an [[inertial fusion power plant]].

Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and [[plasma containment]] led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.&lt;ref name="ITERorg" /&gt;

'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world’s longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">'''Policy laundering''' is the disguising of the origins of political [[decision making|decisions]], laws, or international [[treaty|treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hosein |first=Ian |date=2004 |title=The Sources of Laws: Policy Dynamics in a Digital and Terrorized World |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01972240490456854 |journal=The Information Society |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=187–199 |doi=10.1080/01972240490456854 |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is based on the similar [[money laundering]].

== Hiding responsibility for a policy or decision ==

One common method for policy laundering is the use of international treaties which are formulated in [[secrecy]]. Afterwards it is not possible to find out who advocated for which part of the treaty. Each person can claim that it was not them who demanded a certain paragraph but that they had to agree to the overall "[[compromise]]".

Examples that could be considered as "policy laundering" are [[WIPO]]&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1201_on_20121205210134"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=844544 |title=Catch 1201: A Legislative History and Content Analysis of the DMCA Exemption Proceedings |author1=Herman, Bill D. |author2=Oscar H. Gandy, Jr. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Peter K., The Political Economy of Data Protection, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1046781 Chicago-Kent Law Review, Vol. 83, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Michael |last=Geist |title=Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Harmonization]] is the process through which a common set of policies are established across jurisdictions to remove irregularities. Regulations can change in any direction, however: regulations may be pushed to the [[lowest common denominator]]; but may equally benefit from the '[[California effect]]', where one regulator pushes for the highest standards, setting models for others to follow. Harmonization requires further interrogation, however. In their review of global business regulation, Braithwaite and Drahos find that some countries (notably the U.S. and the UK) push for certain regulatory standards in international bodies and then bring those regulations home under the requirement of harmonization and the guise of [[multilateralism]]; this is what we refer to as policy laundering.|Ian Hosein, 2004&lt;ref&gt;
Hosein, Ian, 2004, [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p73882_index.html "International Relations Theories and the Regulation of International Dataflows: Policy Laundering and other International Policy Dynamics"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Hiding the real objective of a policy ==

One manifestation of policy laundering is claiming a different underlying objective for a policy than is actually the case. The usual reason for politicians following this approach is that the real objective is unpopular with the public. The usual process is to conflate the issue being addressed with an unrelated matter of great public concern. The intervention pursued is presented as addressing an issue of great public concern rather than the underlying objective.

== Circumventing the regular approval process ==

Yet another manifestation of policy laundering is to implement legal policy which a subset of legislators desire but would normally not be able to obtain approval through regular means.

{{quote|ACTA is legislation laundering on an international level of what would be very difficult to get through most Parliaments. |Stavros Lambrinidis, Member of European Parliament, S and D, Greece&lt;ref&gt;[[Stavros Lambrinidis]], Vice President of European Parliament (2009), S and D, Greece, [http://www.stopacta.info/ "Stop Acta"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An example of policy laundering where law was enacted and enforced despite both state and federal courts declaring the law unconstitutional is the ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'' case. At that time, Congress attempted to protect [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] by statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;An Act Making Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1914, Act of March 4, 1913, 38 Stat. 828, c. 145, at page 847.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both state and federal courts declared that law [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Shauver'', 214 Fed. 154 (E.D. Ark. 1914), ''United States v. McCullagh'', 221 Fed. 288 (D.Kan. 1915), ''State v. Sawyer'', 94 A. 886 (Maine 1915), and ''State v. McCullagh'', 153 P. 557 (Kan. 557).&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be denied, authorized parties subsequently negotiated and ratified a treaty with Canada to achieve the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds of August 16, 1916, T.S. No. 628, 39 Stat. 1702.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the treaty was in place, Congress then passed the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] to enforce the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Act of July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755. Codified at 18 U.S.C.§703.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Missouri v. Holland'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld that the new law was constitutional in order to support the treaty.

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policylaundering.org/PolicyLaunderingIntro.html The Policy Laundering Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU's [https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-announces-international-project-stop-policy-laundering Stop Policy Laundering Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Steinhardt (ACLU) [http://26konferencja.giodo.gov.pl/data/resources/SteinhardtB_paper.pdf "The Problem of Policy Laundering"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{by whom|date=February 2012}} that policy laundering has become common political practice in areas related to [[terrorism]] and the erosion of [[civil liberties]]. In the air-travel industry, an example of policy laundering might be the requirement for passengers to show photographic identification. This was presented as addressing [[airport security|security]] concerns, but from the airline's perspective the measure had the important effect of ending unauthorised resale by passengers of unused tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/now-it-seems-we-need-a-passport-inside-canada/article741627/ |title=Now it seems we need a passport inside Canada |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2018 |via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Population health''' has been defined as "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kindig D, Stoddart G | date = March 2003 | title = What is population health? | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 380–3 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380 |pmid=12604476 | pmc=1447747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the [[health]] of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/Conference_Report.pdf Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health] held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, Knickman JR. 2002.

From a population health perspective, health has been defined not simply as a state free from disease but as "the capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes".&lt;ref&gt;Frankish, CJ et al.

Vancouver: Institute of Health Promotion Research, University of British Columbia, 1996. Retrieved 12 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social [[well-being]] and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref name="WHO definition"&gt;World Health Organization.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81). The cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy, as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 170 --&gt;  Family planning saves lives and money by reducing [[unintended pregnancy]] and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Tsui /&gt;

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The economics of health and health care (Vol. 6): Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as obesity and smoking have negative effects on health capital, while education, wage rate, and age may also impact health capital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When people are healthier through preventative care, they have the potential to live a longer and healthier life, work more and participate in the economy, and produce more based on the work done. These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

'''Shortwave radio''' is [[radio]] transmission using shortwave [[radio frequencies]]. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the [[High frequency|high frequency band (HF)]], and generally extends from {{convert|1.7|–|30|MHz|m|abbr=on}}; from the high end of the [[Medium frequency|medium frequency band (MF)]] just above the [[mediumwave]] AM broadcast band, to the end of the [[High frequency|HF band]].

Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]]. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon.  This is called [[skywave]] or "skip" [[radio propagation|propagation]].  Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ([[line-of-sight propagation]]) and are limited by the visual horizon, about {{convert|40|miles|km}}.  Shortwave radio is used for [[broadcasting]] of voice and music to [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]] over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military [[over-the-horizon radar]], diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.

==Frequency classifications==
The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1 (EU+Africa+Russia...)]] definition, and is the span 1.6–30&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]], just above the [[medium wave]] band, which ends approximately at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz.

There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:
* 1.71&amp;nbsp;to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[ITU Region 2|ITU Region 2 (North and South America...)]]
* 1.8&amp;nbsp;(160&amp;nbsp;meter radio amateur band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 26.1&amp;nbsp;MHz (11&amp;nbsp;meter band end)&lt;ref&gt;Inconsistent article: [http://www.itwissen.info/definition/lexikon/Kurzwelle-SW-short-wave-KW.html itwissen.info: KW (Kurzwelle) SW (short wave)] Quote: "... Der KW-Frequenzbereich (SW) liegt zwischen 3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 30&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-1.&amp;nbsp;definition] ... Kurzwelle ist auch eine sendetechnische Bezeichnung für Rundfunk im Frequenzbereich zwischen 2,3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 26,1&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-2.&amp;nbsp;definition] ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtimeradio.de/lexikon.php oldtimeradio.de: Kleines Radio-Lexikon] Quote: "...

* In [[Germany]] and perhaps [[Austria]] the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1]] shortwave radio frequency interval can be subdivided in:
** ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' ("border waves"): 1.605–3.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darc.de/distrikte/k/35/afu-frequenzen/ darc.de: Amateurfunk Frequenzen] Quote: "... Grenzwelle (Kurzwelle) ...", ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' Quote: "... Als Grenzwelle wird der Frequenzbereich zwischen 1605&amp;nbsp;kHz und 3800&amp;nbsp;kHz bezeichnet, weil er auf der „Grenze" zwischen Mittelwelle und Kurzwelle liegt ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Germany these shortwave radio frequency intervals have also been seen used:

In the schematic it is written that the first shortwave band starts at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (just after the band end of MW/AM): "KW1-SW1-OC1 1,6 .... 5,0&amp;nbsp;MHz"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|right|Radio amateurs carried out the first shortwave transmissions over a long distance before [[Guglielmo Marconi]]]]

The name "shortwave" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the [[radio spectrum]] was considered divided into [[long wave]] (LW), [[medium wave]] (MW) and short wave bands based on the [[wavelength]] of the [[radio wave]]s. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;m (1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the [[medium frequency]] band [[History of radio|first used]] for radio communications. The broadcast [[medium wave]] band now extends above the 200&amp;nbsp;m/1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz limit, and the [[amateur radio]] 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;– 2.0&amp;nbsp;MHz band (known as the "[[top band]]") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'. 

Early long distance [[radio telegraphy]] used [[long wave]]s, below 300&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] (kHz).  The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication, and the very expensive [[transmitter]]s, receivers and gigantic antennas that were required. It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances.  Prior to the 1920s, the shortwave frequencies above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use.&lt;ref name="Nebeker2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederik|last=Nebeker|title=Dawn of the Electronic Age: Electrical Technologies in the Shaping of the Modern World, 1914 to 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwmH6-q5O5AC&amp;pg=PA157|date=6 May 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40974-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]], pioneer of radio, commissioned his assistant [[Charles Samuel Franklin]] to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions. Franklin rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|first=John|last=Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75|isbn=9780852962183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission, by inventing the [[curtain array]] aerial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ni7lDl3k5LwC&amp;dq=%22charles+samuel+franklin%22&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;q=charles+samuel+franklin|title=History of Telegraphy|first=K.

The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/beyondionosphere00unitrich/beyondionosphere00unitrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Beyond the ionosphere : fifty years of satellite communication" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from [[Submarine communications cable|transoceanic cables]] and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations,&lt;ref name="Hugill1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Hugill|title=Global Communications Since 1844: Geopolitics and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjfBkup-ccMC&amp;pg=PA129|date=4 March 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6074-4|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s. Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables, although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@carcbradio/cable-companies-595de8871f6b Cable and Wireless Plc History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320053915/http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 |date=2015-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless Ltd.]] in 1934.

Long-distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT-1 across the Atlantic Ocean, the first voice frequency cable on this route. This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world. These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications.

===Amateur use of shortwave propagation===
[[File:Dial.png|thumb|right|[[Hallicrafters SX-28]] shortwave receiver analog tuning dial, circa 1944]]
[[Amateur radio|Amateur radio operators]] also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used [[surface wave]] propagation at [[Very low frequency|very low frequencies]],&lt;ref&gt;Stormfax. [http://www.stormfax.com/wireless.htm Marconi Wireless on Cape Cod]&lt;/ref&gt; which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000&amp;nbsp;meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-club-of-america.org/history.php?page=1921.html |title=1921 – Club Station 1BCG and the Transatlantic Tests |accessdate=2009-09-05 |publisher=Radio Club of America }}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the 200&amp;nbsp;meter [[mediumwave]] band (near 1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz in the modern AM broadcast band) – the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200&amp;nbsp;meters and at least 20&amp;nbsp;North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200&amp;nbsp;meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available [[vacuum tube]]s shortly after World War&amp;nbsp;I.

Extreme interference at the longer edge of the 150–200&amp;nbsp;meter band – the official wavelengths allocated to [[amateur radio operators|amateurs]] by the Second National Radio Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106763342;view=1up;seq=63 |title=Radio Service Bulletin No.&amp;nbsp;72, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–13 |accessdate=2009-09-05 |date=1923-04-02 |publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923 – forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150&amp;nbsp;meters (2&amp;nbsp;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150&amp;nbsp;meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100&amp;nbsp;meters (3&amp;nbsp;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130112737/http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 |date=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000&amp;nbsp;miles (9,600&amp;nbsp;km) and more. On 21&amp;nbsp;September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two-way contacts with an amateur in [[New Zealand]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90&amp;nbsp;minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On 10&amp;nbsp;October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924conf.htm |title=Recommendations for Regulation of Radio: October&amp;nbsp;6–10, 1924 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[80-meter band|80&amp;nbsp;meters]] (3.75&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[40-meter band|40&amp;nbsp;meters]] (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[20-meter band|20&amp;nbsp;meters]] (14&amp;nbsp;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the [[10-meter band|10&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (28&amp;nbsp;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twiar.org/aaarchives/WB008.txt&lt;/ref&gt; on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1927. The [[15-meter band|15&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (21&amp;nbsp;MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1952.

==Propagation characteristics==
[[Image:Skip Zone Example.gif|thumb|right|Formation of a [[skip zone]]]]
Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by [[ionospheric reflection]] back to the earth by the [[ionosphere]], (a phenomenon known as "[[skywave]] propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a [[skip zone]] where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.

As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere, propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths,
[[Scattering|scattered]] by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops, a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques. Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band, absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer, the D layer, may impose a serious limit. This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules, absorbing some of a [[radio frequency]]'s energy and converting it to heat.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Rawer:"Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere". Kluwer, Dordrecht 1993 {{ISBN|0-7923-0775-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions of skywave propagation depend on:
* The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver.
* Time of day.  During the day, frequencies higher than approximately 12&amp;nbsp;MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones. At night, this property is reversed.
* With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer, the [[D layer|D Layer]], forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons.
* Season. During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres, the AM/MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness.
* [[Solar flare]]s produce a large increase in D region ionization so high, sometimes for periods of several minutes, all skywave propagation is nonexistent.

==Types of modulation==
{{Further|Modulation}}
[[Image:Shortwave Radio.jpg|thumb|right|National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver, circa 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shortwaveradio.ch/radio-e/panasonic-e.htm Panasonic/National] ShortwaveRadio.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several different types of [[Modulation|modulation]] are used to incorporate information in a short-wave signal.

===Audio modes===
;AM
[[Amplitude modulation]] is the simplest type and the most commonly used for [[International broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple [[detector (radio)|detector]] recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.

;SSB
[[Single sideband]] transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the [[carrier frequency]]. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly {{frac|2|3}} of the energy sent by an AM signal is in the “carrier”, which is not needed to recover the information contained in the signal. It also reduces signal bandwidth, enabling less than one-half the AM signal bandwidth to be used.

The drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, [[Citizen's Band]], and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is customarilly used below 9&amp;nbsp;MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9&amp;nbsp;MHz.

;VSB
[[Vestigal sideband]] transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio [[time signal]] stations. [[Single sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|Vestigial sideband]] is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and [[8VSB|digital]].

;NFM
Narrow-band [[frequency modulation]] (NBFM or NFM) is used typically above 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. Because of the larger [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] required, NBFM is commonly used for [[VHF]] communication. Regulations limit the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian Robertson |last=Sinclair |title=Audio and Hi-Fi Handbook |publisher=Newnes |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7506-4975-5 |pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;DRM
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. It is a digital signal, like the data modes, below, but is for transmitting audio, like the analog modes above.

===Data modes===
;CW
[[Continuous wave]] (CW) is [[on-off keying|on-and-off keying]] of a carrier, used for [[Morse code]] communications and [[Hellschreiber]] [[facsimile]]-based [[teleprinter]] transmissions. It is a data mode, although often listed separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feld Hell Club |url=https://sites.google.com/site/feldhellclub/Home/feld-hell-faq |website=Google Sites |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;RTTY, FAX, SSTV
[[Radioteletype]], fax, digital, [[slow-scan television]], and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.

Note that on modern computer-driven systems, digital modes are typically sent by coupling a computer's sound output to the SSB input of a radio.

==Users==
[[File:Shortwave_Radio_Dial.jpg|thumb|right|Portable shortwave receiver's digital display tuned to the [[80-meter band|75 meter band]]]]
Some established users of the shortwave radio bands may include:
* [[International broadcasting]] primarily by government-sponsored [[propaganda]], international news (for example, the [[BBC World Service]]) or cultural stations to foreign audiences: the most common use of all.
* Domestic broadcasting: to widely dispersed populations with few [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]] and FM stations serving them; or for specialty political, religious and [[alternative media]] networks; or of individual commercial and non-commercial paid broadcasts.
* Oceanic [[air traffic control]] uses the HF/shortwave band for long distance communication to aircraft over the oceans and poles, which are far beyond the range of traditional [[VHF]] frequencies. Modern systems also include satellite communications, such as ADS-C/[[CPDLC]]
* [[Utility station|"Utility" stations]] transmitting messages not intended for the general public, such as merchant shipping, marine weather, and ship-to-shore stations; for aviation weather and air-to-ground communications; for military communications; for long-distance governmental purposes, and for other non-broadcast communications.
* [[Amateur radio]] operators at the [[80-meter band|80/75]], [[60-meter band|60]], [[40-meter band|40]], [[30-meter band|30]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[17-meter band|17]], [[15-meter band|15]], [[12-meter band|12]], and [[10-meter band|10-meter]] bands. Licenses are granted by authorized government agencies.
* [[Time signal]] and [[radio clock]] stations: In North America, [[WWV (radio station)|WWV radio]] and [[WWVH|WWVH radio]] transmit at these frequencies: 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz; and WWV also transmits on 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[CHU (radio station)|CHU radio station]] in Canada transmits on the following frequencies: 3.33&amp;nbsp;MHz, 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz. Other similar [[radio clock]] stations transmit on various shortwave and longwave frequencies around the world. The shortwave transmissions are primarily intended for human reception, while the longwave stations are generally used for automatic synchronization of watches and clocks.

Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include:
* [[Clandestine radio|Clandestine stations]]. These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces. They may advocate civil war, insurrection, rebellion against the government-in-charge of the country to which they are directed. Clandestine broadcasts may emanate from transmitters located in rebel-controlled territory or from outside the country entirely, using another country's transmission facilities.&lt;ref name="Sterling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H. Sterling|title=Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA538|date=March 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45649-8|pages=538–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Numbers Station]]s. These stations regularly appear and disappear all over the shortwave radio band but are unlicensed and untraceable. It is believed that Numbers Stations are operated by government agencies and are used to communicate with clandestine operatives working within foreign countries. However, no definitive proof of such use has emerged. Because the vast majority of these broadcasts contain nothing but the recitation of blocks of numbers, in various languages, with occasional bursts of music, they have become known colloquially as "Number Stations". Perhaps the most noted Number Station is the [[Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station)|"Lincolnshire Poacher"]], named after the 18th century English folk song, which is transmitted just before the sequences of numbers.
* Unlicensed [[two way radio]] activity by individuals such as taxi drivers, bus drivers and fishermen in various countries can be heard on various shortwave frequencies. Such unlicensed transmissions by "pirate" or "bootleg" two way radio operators&lt;ref name="Magazines1940"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=January 1940|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; can often cause [[Co-channel interference|signal interference]] to licensed stations.&lt;ref name="IARU"&gt;{{cite web|title=IARU Monitoring System|url=http://www.iaru.org/monitoring-system.html|website=iaru.org|publisher=International Amateur Radio Union (IARU)|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pirate radio]] broadcasters who feature programming such as music, talk and other entertainment, can be heard sporadically and in various modes on the shortwave bands.&lt;ref name="Yoder2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Yoder|title=Pirate Radio Stations: Tuning in to Underground Broadcasts in the Air and Online|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMjT5wOX-d4C|year=2002|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-137563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Over-the-horizon radar]]: From 1976 to 1989, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Russian Woodpecker]] over-the-horizon radar system blotted out numerous shortwave broadcasts daily.

===Frequency allocations===
{{Main|Shortwave bands}}
The [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC), organized under the auspices of the [[International Telecommunication Union]], allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The last WRC took place in 2007.

At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for [[international broadcasting]]. AM shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz separation for traditional analog audio broadcasting.

Although countries generally follow the table above, there may be small differences between countries or regions. For example, in the official bandplan of the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/frequentiebeleid/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2007/01/18/nationaal-frequentieplan-nfp.html|title=Nationaal Frequentieplan|author=|date=|website=rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 49 m band starts at 5.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 41 m band ends at 7.45&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 11 m band starts at 25.67&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the 120, 90 and 60 m bands are absent altogether. Additionally, international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies. This is done for practical reasons, or to attract attention in crowded bands (60m, 49m, 40m, 41m, 31m, 25m).

The new [[digital audio broadcasting]] format for shortwave [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] operates 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz format.

The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and [[over-the-horizon radar]]. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] designs (like the [[ALLISS]] antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.

===Advantages===
[[File:Soviet SWL URS3-108-B.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Soviet union|Soviet]] shortwave listener in [[Borisoglebsk]], 1941]]
Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:
* Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries: unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet, government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations (sites) are being listened to (accessed). For example, during the attempted coup against Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], when his access to communications was limited (e.g. his phones were cut off, etc.), Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the [[BBC World Service]] on shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld7078.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low-cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world. Simple shortwave [[regenerative receiver]]s can be easily built with a few parts.
* In many countries (particularly in most developing nations and in the [[Eastern bloc]] during the [[Cold War]] era) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Habrat| first = Marek| title = Odbiornik "Roksana" (Radio constructor's recollections)| url=http://oldradio.pl/karta_odb.php?nrmod=471| accessdate = 2008-08-05| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave).
* Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery-operated, making them useful in difficult circumstances. Newer technology includes [[hand-cranked radio]]s which provide power without batteries.
* Shortwave radios can be used in situations where [[Internet]] or [[satellite communications]] service is temporarily or long-term unavailable (or unaffordable).
* Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM (88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz). Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers, including from one continent to another.
* Particularly in tropical regions, SW is somewhat less prone to interference from [[thunderstorms]] than [[medium wave|medium wave radio]], and is able to cover a large geographic area with relatively low power (and hence cost). Therefore, in many of these countries it is widely used for domestic broadcasting.
* Very little infrastructure is required for long-distance two-way communications using shortwave radio. All one needs is a pair of transceivers, each with an antenna, and a source of energy (such as a battery, a portable generator, or the electrical grid). This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications, which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions. Modern digital transmission modes such as [[MFSK]] and [[Olivia MFSK|Olivia]] are even more robust, allowing successful reception of signals well below the [[noise floor]] of a conventional receiver.

===Disadvantages===
Shortwave radio's benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks, including:
* In most Western countries, shortwave radio ownership is usually limited to true enthusiasts, since most new standard radios do not receive the shortwave band. Therefore, Western audiences are limited.
* In the developed world, shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode]] power adapters, fluorescent or LED light sources, internet modems and routers, computers and many other sources of [[radio interference]].

Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters. In some cases, the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible ''([[DXing]])''; others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or "ute", transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals from [[numbers stations]], stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations, or the two way communications by amateur radio operators. Some short wave listeners behave analogously to "lurkers" on the Internet, in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals.  Other listeners participate in clubs, or actively send and receive QSL cards, or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own.

Many listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience (such as [[Radio Taiwan International]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio France Internationale]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Voice of Korea]], [[Radio Free Sarawak]] etc.). Today, through the evolution of the Internet, the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world, even without owning a shortwave radio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dxing.com/webclink.htm Web-Controlled Radios] DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely, or severely curtailed it, in favour of internet transmission.

Shortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain [[QSL card]]s from broadcasters, utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby. Some stations even give out special certificates, pennants, stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners.

==Shortwave broadcasts and music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1994 WDR.jpg|thumb|right|Composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]]]
Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which—due to the nature of amplitude modulation, varying propagation conditions, and the presence of interference—generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts (particularly via FM stations). Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion, and "hollow" sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies, altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange "spacey" quality due to echoes and phase distortion.  Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions, by means of delays or feedback loops, equalizers, or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments.  Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments, by means of analogue [[tape loop]]s or [[digital sampler|digital samples]].  Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing, with various distortions added, to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception.&lt;ref name="Wörner1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Heinrich Wörner|title=Stockhausen; Life and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqmMPnlXZOMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02143-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sheppard|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZluAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-107-2|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wire&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB5MAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=C. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician [[Léon Theremin]],&lt;ref name=Wire /&gt; who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 ([[regenerative circuit]]s in radios of the time were prone to breaking into [[oscillation]], adding various tonal [[harmonics]] to music and speech); and in the same year, the development of a French instrument called the [[Ondes Martenot]] by its inventor [[Maurice Martenot]], a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] used shortwave radio and effects in works including ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67), ''[[Kurzwellen]]'' (1968)—adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in ''Opus 1970'' with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces—''[[Spiral (Stockhausen)|Spiral]]'' (1968), ''[[Pole (Stockhausen)|Pole]]'', ''[[Expo (Stockhausen)|Expo]]'' (both 1969–70), and ''[[Licht#Wednesday|Michaelion]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Wörner1973" /&gt;

[[Cyprus|Cypriot]] composer [[Yannis Kyriakides]] incorporated shortwave [[numbers station]] transmissions in his 1999 ''ConSPIracy cantata''.&lt;ref name="Dolp2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Dolp|title=Arvo Pärt's White Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=13 July 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-18289-9|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holger Czukay]], a student of Stockhausen, was one of the first to use shortwave in a [[rock music]] context.&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009" /&gt; In 1975, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] recorded a full length [[concept album]] around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds, entitled ''[[Radioactivity (album)|Radio-Activity]]''.&lt;ref name="Barr2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Barr|title=Kraftwerk: from Dusseldorf to the Future With Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mcj4h2qEhQC&amp;pg=PT98|date=31 August 2013|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-7776-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The The]]'s Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php Radio Cineola] www.thethe.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218173001/http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php |date=December 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortwave's future==
[[File:Penny Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|PC spectrum display of a modern [[software defined radio|software defined]] shortwave receiver]]
{{Further|Shortwave listening#Future of shortwave listening}}

The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new [[digital radio]] technology, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of [[power line communication]] (PLC), also known as [[Broadband over Power Lines]] (BPL), which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands, severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="HrasnicaHaidine2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halid Hrasnica|author2=Abdelfatteh Haidine|author3=Ralf Lehnert|title=Broadband Powerline Communications: Network Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d270N6yvWCoC&amp;pg=PA34|date=14 January 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85742-7|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts disagree on the future of shortwave. According to Andy Sennitt, former editor of the [[World Radio TV Handbook]], “shortwave is a legacy technology, which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly. A few countries are hanging on to it, but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone. Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures".&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt;

However Thomas Witherspoon, editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that “shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity". According to Nigel Fry, head of Distribution for the [[BBC World Service]] Group, “I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century, especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure".&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Careless|first1=James|title=The Evolution of Shortwave Radio|url=http://www.radioworld.com/digital-radio/0014/the-evolution-of-shortwave-radio/338422|website=Radio World|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banksy, Hewlett Road, Cheltenham (1) (geograph 3944289) (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Spy Booth'' in 2014]]
'''''Spy Booth''''' was an artwork by [[Banksy]] in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBCJun14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28032154|title=Fears Banksy Cheltenham 'spies' artwork will be removed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece has been seen as a critique of the [[global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Morris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/10/banksy-creator-spy-booth-wall-art-gchq|title=Banksy confirms he is creator of Spy Booth wall art near GCHQ |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robin Barton and [[Bankrobber London]] helped with the preservation of the artwork,&lt;ref name=BBCJun29_6_14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28078938 |title=Cheltenham Banksy: Deal to save it 'close to agreement'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to broker the removal and sale of the piece. However the artwork was painted onto a Grade II [[listed building]] - [[153-159 Fairview Road]] - and the council prevented it from being removed, giving it retrospective listed building consent in 2015 and affording it some protection from removal. Despite this, the artwork was either removed or destroyed in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-37148473&lt;/ref&gt;

|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M. Daniel|title=The history of tuberculosis|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2006.08.006|url=http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111%2806%2900401-X/fulltext#back-bib19|volume=100|journal=Respiratory Medicine|pages=1862–1870|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resmedjournal.com" /&gt;
|-
|Middle Ages and Renaissance||The incidence of tuberculosis grows progressively in these times, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers move to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Europe, tuberculosis is known as the “king’s evil” and is widely believed that the kings of England and France can cure ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]]'' simply by touching those affected.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Tuberculosis.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].
|-
|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed. Several international conferences are held, focusing on the fundamental, biological, clinical and social aspects of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.theunion.org/who-we-are/history|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|1980s onward||Tuberculosis [[antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains appear, provoking a rise in incidence in countries like [[Great Britain|Britain]].

|Present||Today, tuberculosis continues to be a top infectious disease killer worldwide. However, the death rate has dropped 47% since 1990. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries, with the most severe burden in Africa.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; At least 1 million children fall ill with tuberculosis each year, represent about 11% of all cases.&lt;ref name="ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN|url=http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/childhood_tb_informationsheet.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stethoscope marks a major step in the redefinition of disease from being a bundle of symptoms, to the current sense of a disease as a problem with an anatomical system even if there are no noticeable symptoms. The work of Laennec is considered to have clearly elucidated the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and unified the concept of the disease, whether pulmonary or extrapulmonary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=Big Ideas: Jacalyn Duffin on the History of the Stethoscope|url=http://ww3.tvo.org/video/182217/jacalyn-duffin-history-stethoscope|publisher=TVO|accessdate=9 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927173037/http://ww3.tvo.org/video/182217/jacalyn-duffin-history-stethoscope|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The history of tuberculosis"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The history of tuberculosis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461110600401X|accessdate=9 September 2016 | doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2006.08.006|volume=100|journal=Respiratory Medicine|pages=1862–1870|year=2006 | last1 = Daniel | first1 = Thomas M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;||[[Paris]], France

'''Transnational gangs''' can be described as [[gangs]] that are located in multiple countries. When these gangs commit crimes in one country, their plans for the crime can sometimes be put together in another country. These gangs or&amp;nbsp;[[Mara (gang)|mara]]&amp;nbsp;are able to move around efficiently from one place to another. Transnational gangs are not a normal&amp;nbsp;[[street gang]]&amp;nbsp;because they are much larger in size and located in more than one country; they are considered to be able to pose a significant threat for the safety of the countries they are located in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/afri/aspj/apjinternational/apj-s/2008/2tri08/sullivaneng.htm|title=Transnational Gangs|website=www.au.af.mil|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of International Associations''' ('''UIA''') is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] research institute and documentation center based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and operating under [[United Nations]] mandate. It was founded in 1907 under the name [[Central Office of International Associations]] by [[Henri La Fontaine]],  the 1913 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, and [[Paul Otlet]], a founding father of what is now called [[information science]].

The UIA is an independent research institute and a repository for current and historical information on the work of global [[civil society]]. It serves two main purposes: to document and promote public awareness of the work of [[Yearbook of International Organizations|international organizations]] (both [[International nongovernmental organization|INGOs]] and [[Intergovernmental organizations|IGOs]]), [[International Congress Calendar|international meetings]], and [[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|world problems]]. The UIA also supports and facilitates the work of international associations through training and networking opportunities.

It has consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] and [[UNESCO]].

==Aims==

* Facilitate the development and efficiency of nongovernmental networks in every field of human activity – especially non-profit and voluntary associations – considered to be essential components of contemporary society
* Collect, research and disseminate information on international bodies, both governmental and nongovernmental, their interrelationships, their meetings, and the problems and strategies with which they are concerned
* Experiment with meaningful and action-oriented ways of presenting such information to enable these initiatives to develop and counterbalance each other creatively, and act as a catalyst for the emergence of new forms of associative activity and international co-operation
* Promote research on the legal, administrative and other problems common to these international associations, especially in their contacts with governmental bodies
* Contribute to a universal order based on principles of human dignity, solidarity of peoples and freedom of association and communication

==History==
The two founders started work setting up the Central Office of International Organisations and then conducting a survey of international organisations with headquarters in Belgium. Then with the help of the sociologist [[Cyril van Overbergh]] they extend this research to organisations based elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WELIS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rayward |first1=W.

The '''Women's World Golf Rankings''', also known for sponsorship reasons as the '''[[Rolex]] Rankings''', were introduced in February 2006. They are sanctioned by eight women's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] and the organisations behind them: [[Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA Tour), [[Ladies European Tour]], [[Ladies Professional Golfers' Association of Japan]] (LPGA of Japan Tour), [[Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA of Korea Tour), [[Australian Ladies Professional Golf]] (ALPG Tour), [[Symetra Tour]], [[China LPGA Tour|China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour]], the [[LET Access Series|Ladies European Tour Access Series]] and also by the [[Ladies' Golf Union]], which administers the [[Women's British Open]] and the [[United States Golf Association]] which conducts the [[U.S. Women's Open]].

The idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005,&lt;ref name="rankingsplanned"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Women's World Rankings to begin in 2005
  | publisher = Golf Today
  | date = 2004
  | url = http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news04/womens_rankings.html
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but then put back to 2006.

==Calculation of the rankings==
The rankings are based on performances on the eight major tours (LPGA, JLPGA, KLPGA, LET, ALPG, Symetra Tour, LETAS, CLPGA) over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Ranking. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the five [[LPGA majors]] and all Symetra Tour, CLPGA and LETAS events, which have a fixed-point allocation. Rankings are tapered so the recent results are more important.

===Original formula===
When the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years. In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period to be included in the rankings.

===Formula revisions===
On 2 August 2006 the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula.&lt;ref name="aug2006rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Two modifications announced for Rolex Rankings
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 3 August 2006
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?mid=2&amp;pid=7574
  | accessdate =3 August 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The elimination of the minimum event requirement. Players would no longer be required to participate in 15 qualifying events to be included in the rankings and could be included after playing in as few as one qualifying event. This change would also have the effect of permitting amateurs who had played well in one event to be ranked (e.g., [[Morgan Pressel]], who finished second in the 2005 [[U.S. Women's Open]], or [[Michelle Wie]] from age 13).
# The introduction of a minimum divisor. Where previously a player's point total was divided by the number of events she played over the previous 104 weeks, now the player's point total would be divided by the greater of (i) the number of events played or (ii) 35. Thus, players with 35 or more events over the previous 104 weeks would continue to use the actual number of events played as the divisor, but players with fewer than 35 events would use 35 as the divisor.

Many commentators saw the latter change as directed at [[Michelle Wie]], who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period. However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.

On 16 April 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a stronger value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13 week decrements previously used.&lt;ref name="apr162007rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Modification Announced to Rolex Rankings Calculations
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 9 April 2007
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=10409&amp;mid=4
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.

==Criticisms==
When they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/b/a/245967.htm |title=First Women's World Golf Rankings Stir Up Controversy |last=Kelley |first=Brent |publisher=about.com |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable [[Michelle Wie]] to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings – that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament – Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than 15, Wie would not have been ranked at all.

The August 2006 revised formula addressed the second criticism. The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing "strength of the field" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.

==Significance of the rankings==
The rankings are used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. For example, 40 of the 144 places in the [[Women's British Open]] are currently awarded on the basis of the rankings—10 to LET members and 30 to LPGA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lgu.org/data/files/entry_2011_rwboconditions.pdf |title=Entry Form, 2011 Ricoh Women's British Open: Rules and Conditions |publisher=[[Ladies' Golf Union]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2011}} See especially "7. Exemptions from Pre-Qualifying and Final Qualifying", pages 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the 12 places in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team are allocated on the basis of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4918154.stm |title=Solheim selection process changes |work=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the rankings at the end of each LPGA Tour season in odd-numbered years have determined the eight countries that will compete in the following year's [[International Crown]], a LPGA-sponsored team event scheduled in even-numbered years and first held in 2014. More specifically, the countries whose top four players have the highest cumulative rankings are invited to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpga.com/golf/news/2013/1/global-announcement.aspx |title=32 Players, 8 Countries, 1 Crown: LPGA Unveils the International Crown |publisher=LPGA |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual participants from each qualified country are determined by the rankings immediately prior to the [[ANA Inspiration]] (known before 2015 as the Kraft Nabisco Championship) in the year of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpgainternationalcrown.com/golf/news/2013/7/international-crown-tickets.aspx |title=LPGA International Crown Celebrates "Year from Here" Event |publisher=LPGA |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;
*On 12 January 2009, [[Annika Sörenstam]], who was ranked No. 3 the previous week despite having announced her retirement effective at the end of the 2008 season, was removed from the rankings. No official explanation was given for her removal.

The current '''world's longest meat hot dog''' record holder measured {{convert|203.8|m|ft}} and was manufactured by [[Novex]] of Paraguay in 2011. [[Sara Lee Corp.]] made a [[hot dog]], {{convert|1996|ft|m}} long, in commemoration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' does not reflect this record in any of its publications as of 2006. Speculation surrounding the 1996-foot record is that although the hot dog was most likely continuous, the bun (an integral part of the hot dog unit) was not. Since October 2017 the town [[Flensburg]], in Germany claimed to have manufactured the World's longest hot dog with {{convert|218|m|ft}}.

==Current world records ==
On July 15, 2011, a hot dog measuring {{convert|203.8|m|ft}} and weighing approximately {{convert|120|kg|lb}} was made by Ochsi to obtain the world record. The [[hot dog bun]] weighed approximately {{convert|150|kg|lb}} and was made by Myriam Products. International media were on hand, and supporting documents have been verified by Johanna Hessling, of Guinness. The hot dog was made as the central part of a media event surrounding the 2011 Expo in Asuncion, Paraguay. After the official measurement, the hot dog was cut up and eaten by those present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/paraguay-tiene-el-record-guiness-con-un-pancho-de-203-80-metros/|title=Paraguay tiene el récord Guinness con un pancho de 203,80 metros|author=ABC Color|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2017 was by local authorities in Flensburg on the [[pier|seabridge]] of the suburb [[Glücksburg]] a U-shaped hot dog measured with {{convert|218.7|m|ft}}. After the official measurement, the hot dog was also cut up and eaten by those present.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag]]: [https://www.shz.de/lokales/flensburger-tageblatt/der-weltrekord-steht-id17993121.html Der Weltrekord steht], published and access: October 4, 2017 and [http://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Rekordjaeger-bauen-218-Meter-langen-Hotdog-article20064731.html In Glücksburg geht's um die WurstRekordjäger bauen 218 Meter langen Hotdog], published and access: October 4, 2017 and [http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Gluecksburg-feiert-mit-dem-laengsten-Hotdog,hotdog120.html Glücksburg feiert mit dem längsten Hotdog], published October 3, 2017; access: October 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

It required {{convert|25|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of sausage meat, {{convert|33|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of dough, {{convert|10|L|USqt|abbr=off}} of tomato sauce and mustard, and "enough onions to fill a Honda Civic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/perth/stories/s1580171.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016060014/http://www.abc.net.au/perth/stories/s1580171.htm |date=October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 6, 2006, a hot dog and bun measuring {{convert|104.75|ft|m}} was made by the Hill Meat Company of Pendleton, OR and Franz Family Bakeries of Portland, OR.  The hot dog was made as the central part of a media event surrounding the 100th anniversary of [[Franz Family Bakeries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbakery.com |title=Home &amp;#124; Franz Family Bakeries |publisher=Usbakery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 4, 2006, a hot dog measuring {{convert|60|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in a bun measuring {{convert|60.3|m|ft|sigfig=3}} was made by the Shizuoka Meat Producers of Shizuoka, Japan and the [[:ja:全日本パン協同組合連合会|All-Japan Bread Association]] to obtain the world record. International media were on hand, and supporting documents have been verified by Guinness. The hot dog was made as the central part of a media event surrounding the 50th anniversary of the [[:ja:全日本パン協同組合連合会|All-Japan Bread Association]]. The wiener was made offsite at the Shizuoka plant prior to the day, and it was then cooked along with the bread in a ballroom at the [[Akasaka Prince Hotel]] in [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. After the official measurement, the hot dog was cut up and eaten by those present.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhJlmerwRNE][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1H1XvKRzH4][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaqNrkfDoI][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDPJD-df7E4]

==Technical challenges==
Creating a long hot dog is not much of a feat. This is because the hot dog is structurally quite sound, and remarkably flexible. In the August 2006 record breaking attempt, the hot dog was manufactured by Shizuoka Meat Producers, and wound into a large plastic barrel which was easily transported inside a delivery van.

The limiting factor for breaking this type of record is the bun. The bun, in order to remain in one continuous unit, needs to be baked in its final form. For the All-Japan Bread Association, this meant the connection of the longest conveyor belt possible with the equipment available to them. The dough was assembled in half-meter sections, then pressed together to create a longer tube of dough, which was then fed through the ovens via conveyor, and carried away from the ovens by another conveyor. The key was to make sure that the already-cooked bun did not move at a faster rate than the bun behind it because this would cause the bun to pull apart. The wiener was fed through the oven at the same time to cook it.  There also needed to be space outside the oven to store the bun and wiener until the entire bun had been baked. To allow for enough room for this to happen, the ovens and prep area were set up outside the ballroom of the [[Akasaka Prince Hotel]] on the loading dock, and the bun and wiener were fed into the ballroom along the conveyor as they exited the oven.

Upon completion, the bun was sliced down the middle by bakers, and spectators were asked to don rubber gloves and first lift the wiener in one piece for photos, and then insert it into the bun. After being topped with mustard and ketchup, the completed hot dog was lifted by the assembled spectators {{convert|30|cm|in}} off the conveyor for photos. Finally, the official measurement was completed, and the wiener was {{convert|60|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in length, with the bun coming in at {{convert|60.3|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in length. After photos and video of the official measurement were completed, the hot dog was cut into sections and the assembled spectators each had a piece. However, this only used about {{convert|8|m|ft}} of the hot dog.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9633">The '''World Development Report''' (WDR) is an annual report published since 1978 by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) or [[World Bank]]. Each WDR provides in-depth analysis of a specific aspect of [[economic development]]. Past reports have considered such topics as agriculture, youth, equity, [[public services]] delivery, the role of the state, [[Transition economy|transition economies]], labour, infrastructure, [[global health|health]], the environment, risk management, and poverty. The reports are the Bank's best-known contribution to thinking about development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/LOTTGBE9I0 World Bank: ''World Development Reports''], accessed 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The World Development Report 2019==
[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf The World Development Report 2019] studies the impact of technology on the nature of work. It is the most-downloaded World Development Report, with more than a million downloads, half of which before its official publication. The study was led by [[Simeon Djankov]] and Federica Saliola.

==The World Development Report 2014==
''The World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development'' looked at risk management from a development perspective. It argued that managing risks such as job loss, crime, disease, disaster, social unrest, and financial and macroeconomic turbulence responsibly can save lives, avert damages, prevent development setbacks, and unleash opportunities. The report proposed a conceptual framework for thinking about risk and resilience, identified obstacles to better risk management, and recommended numerous avenues for better risk management that can be pursued by individuals, families, communities, enterprises, governments, and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/OSAT4FHFP0 World Bank: ''World Development Reports''], accessed 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The World Development Report 2011==
''[[The World Development Report 2011|The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development]]'' looked at conflict as a challenge to economic development. It analyzed the nature, causes and development consequences of modern violence and highlight lessons learned from efforts to prevent or recover from violence.
The goal of this WDR was considered to promote new ways of preventing or addressing violent conflict. By drawing on insight and experiences from a host of past and present situations, the report identified promising national and regional initiatives as well as directions for change in international responses, and discuss how lessons can be applied in situations of vulnerability to violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/ World Bank: ''The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development''], accessed 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The World Development Report is published by the World Bank.

==Previous reports 2008-2010==
The '''WDR 2010''', on the theme "Development and Climate Change", explored how public policy can change to better help people cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and how energy systems will need to be transformed. The report was seen as a call for action, both for developing countries who are striving to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income countries who need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries’ efforts.

The '''WDR 2009''' focused on the theme "Reshaping Economic Geography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/product?item_id=8672028 World Bank: ''World Development Report 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt; Rising densities of human settlements, migration and transport to reduce distances to market, and specialization and trade facilitated by fewer international divisions are central to [[economic development]]. The transformations along these three dimensions—density, distance, and division—are most noticeable in North America, [[Western Europe]], and Japan, but countries in Asia and [[Eastern Europe]] are changing in ways similar in scope and speed.

The report concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of [[Developing country|developing nations]]. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's "bottom billion", while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: [[economic growth]] is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress.

The '''WDR 2008''' addressed "Agriculture for Development", calling for greater investment in agriculture in developing countries. The report warned that the sector must be placed at the center of the development agenda if the goals of halving [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 are to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/product-detail?product_id=6966252 World Bank: ''World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development'']&lt;/ref&gt;

While 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas in developing countries, a mere 4 percent of [[official development assistance]] goes to agriculture. In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], a region heavily reliant on agriculture for overall growth, [[Public finance|public spending]] for farming is also only 4 percent of total [[government spending]] and the sector is still taxed at relatively high levels. For the poorest people, GDP growth originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in raising incomes of extremely poor people than GDP growth originating outside the sector.

“A dynamic ‘agriculture for development’ agenda can benefit the estimated 900 million rural people in the [[Developing world]] who live on less than $1 a day, most of whom are engaged in agriculture,” said [[Robert Zoellick|Robert B. Zoellick]], [[World Bank Group]] President. “We need to give agriculture more prominence across the board. At the global level, countries must deliver on vital reforms such as cutting distorting subsidies and opening markets, while [[civil society]] groups, especially farmer organizations, need more say in setting the agricultural agenda.”

According to the report, agriculture can offer pathways out of poverty if efforts are made to increase productivity in the staple foods sector; connect smallholders to rapidly expanding high-value horticulture, poultry, aquaculture, as well as dairy markets; and generate jobs in the rural nonfarm economy.

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.

{{basic forms of government}}
'''World government''' or '''global government''' is the notion of a common [[political]] authority for all of humanity, yielding a global [[government]] and a single [[state (polity)|state]] that exercises [[authority]] over the entire [[Earth]]. Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [[world domination]] or through peaceful and voluntary [[supranational union]].

There has never been a worldwide [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], [[military]], or [[constitution]] with global jurisdiction. The [[United Nations]], beyond the [[United Nations Security Council]] (which has the ability to issue mandatory resolutions), is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster co-operation between existing [[nation|national]] governments rather than exert authority over them.

==History==

===Origins of the idea===
The idea and aspiration of world government has been known since the dawn of history. Bronze Age Egyptian Kings aimed to rule "All That the Sun Encircles", Mesopotamian Kings "All from the Sunrise to the Sunset", and ancient Chinese and Japanese Emperors "All under Heaven". These four civilizations developed impressive cultures of [[Great Unity]], or Da Yitong as the Chinese put it. In 113 BC, the Han Dynasty in China erected an Altar of the Great Unity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] II:38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] said that the Roman achievement of imposing one Government over the Mediterranean world was a "marvelous" achievement, and that the main task of future historians will be to explain how this was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | title=The Histories of Polybius | volume=1 | author=[[Polybius]] | translator=Evelyn S. Shuckburg from the text of F. Hultsch | year=1889 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | publisher=Macmillan and Co | location=London and New York | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328103700/http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | archive-date=2016-03-28 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dante===
The idea of world government outlived the fall of the [[Pax Romana]] for a millennium. [[Dante]] in the fourteenth century despairingly appealed to the human race: "But what has been the condition of the world since that day the seamless robe [of Pax Romana] first suffered mutilation by the claws of avarice, we can read—would that we could not also see! O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, and sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"" (''[[De Monarchia]]'', 16:1)

===Francisco de Vitoria===
{{Main|Francisco de Vitoria}}

Early father of international law, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (c. 1483–1546) is considered the "founder of global political philosophy". De Vitoria conceived of the ''res publica totius orbis'', or the "republic of the whole world". This came at a time when the [[University of Salamanca]] was engaged in unprecedented thought concerning [[human rights]], [[international law]], and early economics based on the experiences of the [[Spanish Empire]].

===Hugo Grotius===
{{Main|Hugo Grotius}}
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|150px|Title page of the 1631 second edition of ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'']]

''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace'') is a 1625 book in Latin, written by [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645) and published in Paris, on the legal status of war. It is now regarded as a foundational work in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html USYD.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220195422/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius was a philosopher, theologian, playwright, and poet. He is known for coming up with the idea of having an international law, and is still acknowledged today by the American Society of International Law.

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Writing in 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] considered World Citizenship to be a necessary step in establishing world peace]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote the essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]] ([[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf.]]) (1795)". In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of [[Perpetual peace|lasting peace]] throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.

The "Preliminary Articles" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:

# "No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War"
# "No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation"
# "[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished"
# "National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States"
# "No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,
# "No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State"

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.

# "The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican"
# "The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States"
# "The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality"

===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===
The year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''Characteristics of the Present Age'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:

{{quote|
There is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally... Such is the case in Ancient History ... As the States become stronger in themselves and cast off that [Papal] foreign power, the tendency towards a Universal Monarchy over the whole Christian World necessarily comes to light... This tendency ... has shown itself successively in several States which could make pretensions to such a dominion, and since the fall of the Papacy, it has become the sole animating principle of our History... Whether clearly or not—it may be obscurely—yet has this tendency lain at the root of the undertakings of many States in Modern Times... Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward.&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, (1806). "Characteristics of the Present Age," ''Theory and Practice of the Balance of Power, 1486–1914: Selected European Writings'', (ed. Moorhead Wright, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1975, pp. 87–89).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Joseph Smith===
{{Main|World Government (Mormonism)}}
{{See also|Theodemocracy}}

In early 19th century [[Mormon]] theology, [[Joseph Smith]] taught that a [[theodemocracy]] would guide and direct the [[Kingdom of God]] ([[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]) on the earth during the [[end time]]s. On March 11, 1844, Smith organized a [[Council of Fifty]], who were to work under the direction of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities of his church, along with a [[Council of Friends]]. This group of three organizations was expected to rule as a world government just prior to the [[Millennialism|Millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrus |first= Hyrum Leslie |date= 1958 |title= Joseph Smith and World Government |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |oclc= 4146522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BYUR1.1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |contribution= Joseph Smith and World Government |title= Book Reviews |first= Robert E. |last= Riggs |pages= 71–73 |journal= [[BYU Studies]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date= Winter 1959 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107125015/http://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |archivedate= 2011-11-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |title= The Grand Fundamental Principles of Mormonism: Joseph Smith's Unfinished Reformation |first= Don |last= Bradley |date= April 2006 |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |pages= 32–41 |access-date= 2012-02-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140634/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |archive-date= 2012-09-04 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alfred, Lord Tennyson===
In 1842, the English poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], published the oft-quoted lines "[[Locksley Hall]]": ''For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see / Saw a Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be /... / Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer / and the battle-flags were furled / In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. / There the common sense of most shall hold / a fretful realm in awe / And the kindly earth shall slumber / lapt in universal law''.

===Ulysses S. Grant===
President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was convinced in 1873: "Transport, education and rapid development of both spiritual and material relationships by means of steam power and the telegraph, all this will make great changes. I am convinced that the Great Framer of the World will so develop it that it becomes one nation, so that armies and navies are no longer necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Clarence Streit]], [[Union Now|Union Now: The Proposal for Inter-Democracy Federal Union]], (London &amp; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1940), p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also commented, "I believe at some future day, the nations of the earth will agree on some sort of congress which will take cognizance of international questions of difficulty and whose decisions will be as binding as the decisions of the Supreme Court are upon us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartzberg |first= Joseph E. |authorlink= Joseph E.

===William Gladstone===
The first thinker to anticipate a kind of world unity ("great household of the world") under the American primacy seems to be British politician [[William Gladstone]]. In 1878, he wrote:

{{quote|
While we have been advancing with portentous rapidity, America is passing us by as if a canter. There can hardly be a doubt, as between America and England, of the belief that the daughter at no very distant time will ... be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother ... She [America] will probably become what we are now—head servant in the great household of the world...&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Hans Kohn]], "The US and Western Europe: A New Era of Understanding," ''Orbis'', 6/1,  (1962): p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kang Youwei===
In 1885, [[Kang Youwei]] published his ''One World Philosophy'', where he based his vision on the evidence of political expansion which began in the immemorial past and went in his days on.&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 85).&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes:

{{quote|Finally, the present Powers of the world were formed.  This process [of coalescing and forming fewer, larger units] has all taken place among the 10,000 countries over several thousand years. The progression from dispersion to union among men, and the principle [whereby] the world is [gradually] proceeding from being partitioned off to being opened up, is a spontaneous [working] of the Way of Heaven (or Nature) and human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No factor, he believed, in the long run could resist the "laws of empires".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kang Youwei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, pp. 79–80, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; Kang Youwei projects the culmination of the ongoing world unification with the final confrontation between the United States and Germany: "Some day America will take in [all the states of] the American continent and Germany will take in all the [states of] Europe.  This will hasten the world along the road to One World."&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"/&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (1886) envisaged: 
{{quote|
I should rather prefer such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening—namely to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the domination of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Vacher de Lapouge===
The French demographer, George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], followed K'ang Yu-wei in 1899 with his ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social''. Similarly, he outlined the logistic growth of empires from the Bronze Age till his days, when "six states govern... three quarters of the globe", and concluded: "The moment is close when the struggle for the domination of the world is going to take place."&lt;ref&gt;George Vacher de Lapouge, ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," p. XXXI).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacher de Lapouge did not bet on Washington and Berlin in the final contest for world domination contrary to K'ang Yu-wei. Like his earlier compatriot, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], he guessed the Cold War contenders correctly but he went one step further. He estimated the chances of the United States as favorite in the final confrontation:

{{quote|The reign of Europe is over, well over... The future of France seems less certain but it is unnecessary to become illusioned... I do not believe by the way that Germany might count for a much longer future... We could... envisage... the possibility that England and her immense Empire comes to surrender to the United States. The latter... is the true adversary of Russia in the great struggle to come... I also believe that the United States is appealed to triumph. Otherwise, the universe would be Russian.&lt;ref&gt;George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," pp. XXXI–XXXII).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bahá'u'lláh===
In the second half of the 19th century, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] founded the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a religion which identified the establishment of world unity and a global federation of nations as a key principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Bahá'í International Community | date = 1995 | title = Turning Point for All Nations | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | access-date = 2013-03-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130406044732/http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | archive-date = 2013-04-06 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He envisioned a [[Bahá'í administration|set of new social structures]] based on participation and consultation among the world's peoples, including a world legislature, an international court, and an international executive empowered to carry out the decisions of these legislative and judicial bodies. [[Bahá'í Faith#Social principles|Connected principles of the Bahá'í religion]] include universal systems of weights and measures, currency unification, and the adoption of a global auxiliary language.&lt;ref name="Neusner2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=McMullen|first=Mike|editor=Neusner, Jacob|editor-link=Jacob Neusner|title=World Religions in America|edition=4th|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky|isbn=0-664-23320-1|chapter=The Bahá'í Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]],'' first published in 1938, [[Shoghi Effendi]], great-grandson of Bahá'u'lláh and the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Bahá'í Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957, described the anticipated world government of that religion as the "world's future super-state" with the Bahá'í Faith as the "State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=7 |chapter=Local and National Houses of Justice |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-3.html#pg7 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shoghi Effendi, "The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá'u'lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=203 |chapter=World Unity the Goal |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-56.html#pg203 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his many scriptures and messages addressed to the most prominent state leaders of his time, Bahá'u'lláh called for world reconciliation, reunification, [[collective security]] and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Many of the most fundamental [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] address the central issue of world unity, such as the following: "The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author=Bahá'u'lláh  |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh  |date=1976  |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh  |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust  |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA  |isbn=0-87743-187-6  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |access-date=2013-03-29  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403063729/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |archive-date=2013-04-03  |dead-url=no  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|title=Global statistics for all religions: 2001 AD|author=|date=|website=www.bible.ca|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xz7V0tX7?url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|archive-date=2011-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Peace Congress===
{{Main|International Peace Congress}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}

Starting in 1843, [[International Peace Congress]]es were held in [[Europe]] every two years, but lost their momentum after 1853 due to the renewed outbreak of wars in Europe ([[Crimea]]) and North America ([[American Civil War]]).

===International organizations===
{{Main|International organizations}}
[[File:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|thumb|150px|Emblem of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] ]]

International organizations started forming in the late 19th century – the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in 1863, the [[Telegraphic Union]] in 1865 and the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1874. The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published "The Institutes of the Law of Nations" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed "an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions".

===H. G. Wells===
In ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1900), [[H. G. Wells]] envisaged that "the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic" will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, "a New Republic dominating the world", will by the year 2000 become the means "by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever". It will be "a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle". Such a synthesis "of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', pp 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Republic "will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes..." Its principles and opinions "must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase". The New Republic must ultimately become a "World-State".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===League of Nations===
{{Main|League of Nations}}
{{See also|Fourteen Points}}

The [[League of Nations]] (LoN) was an inter-governmental organization founded as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919–1920. At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.

===World Communism===
According to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.

Although [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.

The heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917–23]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].

===Halford Mackinder===
Anticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:
{{quote| 
Gradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater. It may perhaps be thought that with the continuance of this process all mankind will be in the end unified … Unless I mistake, it is the message of geography that international cooperation in any future that we need consider must be based on the federal idea. If our civilization is not to go down in blind internecine conflict, there must be a development of world planning out of regional planning, just as regional planning has come from town planning.&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Habitat," ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'', 47, (1931): p 333, also 335.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nazi Germany===
{{Further|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum}}

The ruling [[Nazi Party]] of 1933–1945 [[Germany]] envisaged the ultimate establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard L. (1995) ''Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in modern German and world history''. [[Cambridge University Press]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=9OfrTvu7CNYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=hitler+world+peace+can+be+obtained+only&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=VqgYTcyqGYihOprn7LsJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20peace&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt; In its move to overthrow the post-[[World War I]] [[Treaty of Versailles]] Germany had already withdrawn itself from the [[League of Nations]], and it did not intend to join a similar [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] organization ever again.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1995, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In his desire and stated political aim of expanding the living space (''Lebensraum'') of the German people by destroying or driving out "lesser-deserving races" in and from other territories dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] may have devised an ideological system of self-perpetuating [[expansionism]], in which the expansion of a state's population would require the conquest of more territory which would, in turn, lead to a further growth in population which would then require even more conquests.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt; In 1927, [[Rudolf Hess]] relayed to [[Walter Hewel]] Hitler's belief that [[world peace]] could only be acquired "when one power, the [[Racial supremacism|racially best one]], has attained uncontested supremacy". When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself "the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly".&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt;

===Imperial Japan===
During its imperial period (1868–1945), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, "''[[Hakkō ichiu]]''", translated as "eight corners of the world under one roof". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Greater Asian Coprosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.

===Atlantic Charter===
{{Main|Atlantic Charter}}
[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]

The [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.

===Harry Truman===
U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: "We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

===World Federalist Movement===

{{Main|World Federalist Movement}}
{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}

The years between the conclusion of World War II and 1950, when the [[Korean War]] started and the [[Cold War]] mindset became dominant in international politics, were the "golden age" of the world federalist movement. [[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the "bible" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.

Similar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.

===United Nations===
{{Main|United Nations}}
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]

[[World War II]] (1939–1945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.

===Proposed United Nations Parliamentary Assembly===
{{Main|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly}}
[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]

A [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

===Garry Davis===
In France, 1948, [[Garry Davis]] began an unauthorized speech calling for a world government from the balcony of the UN General Assembly, until he was dragged away by the guards. Davis [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his American citizenship]] and started a [[Registry of World Citizens]]. On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of [[Ellsworth, Maine]] the formation of the "World Government of World Citizens" based on 3 "World Laws"—One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |title=Worldservice.org |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043653/http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |archive-date=2010-02-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this declaration, mandated, he claimed, by Article twenty one, Section three of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government. Its first task was to design and begin selling "World Passports", which the organisation argues is legitimatised by on Article 13, Section 2 of the UDHR.

====World Passport====
{{main|World Passport}}
The World Passport is a 45-page document sold by the [[World Service Authority]], a non-profit organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm Romingerlegal.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206221359/http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm|date=2010-02-06}}, 99-1334 - U.S. v. THOMAS - 07/07/2000&lt;/ref&gt; citing Article 13, Section 2, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. World Passports have allegedly  been accepted sporadically by some 174 countries, but no immigration authority has a de facto or de jure policy of acceptance with regards to the document. The latest edition of the World Passport, which has been on sale since January 2007, is an MRD ([[Machine-readable passport|machine readable document]]) with an alphanumeric code bar enabling computer input plus an embedded "ghost" photo for security, printing overcovered with a plastic film. The document is in 7 languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese|Simplified Chinese]] and [[Esperanto]]. Two covers are available: "World Passport", and "World Government Passport" (for registered World Citizens), ("passport" is in 7 languages on both covers). Other documents sold by the WSA include a World Birth Certificate, a World Political Asylum Card, a World Marriage Certificate, and a World Identity Card. Each page within the document is numbered and each page has the World Citizen logo in the background. There are two pages for affiliation with companies, organizations, and firms. There are nineteen visa pages in the document. On the back cover there are spaces for personal information such as a person’s home address.

===Legal Realism (1954)===
{{Main|E. Adamson Hoebel}}

Legal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331–333)&lt;/ref&gt; "Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates – postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done – and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law – then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive".

===End of the Cold War (1992)===
While enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–1992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.

Following the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.

==Current global governance system==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]
{{As of|2018}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.

The Earth is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations.  In this way a countries cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.

Among the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:
* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.
* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;br/&gt;Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.
* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the "closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.
* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.
* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.
* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.
* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.

In addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the "[[global market]]") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws. A proactive form of globalization is emerging, spawned by international corporations that wish to loosen trade restrictions. It is the global financial firms that have been the most eager proponents of this expansion. A group of advocates from different parts of the world had been pushing for an integrated global society as envisioned in the Globalist Manifesto which is the foundation of globalism ideology.&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;Falk, Avner.

==Existing regional unions of nations==
{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}

The only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Bauböck-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

There are a number of other regional organizations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects.

* [[African Union]] (AU)
* [[Arab League]]
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN)
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM)
* [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA)
* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS)
* [[Commonwealth of Nations]] 
* [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (CCASG)
* [[East African Community]] (EAC)
* [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EEU)
* [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)
* [[Organization of American States]] (OAS)
* [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC)
* [[Turkic Council]] (TurkKon)
* [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR)
* [[Union State]]

Other organisations that have also discussed greater integration include:

* [[Arab League]] into an "[[Arab Union]]"
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) into a "Caribbean Federation"
* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) into a "[[North American Union]]"
* [[Pacific Islands Forum]] into a "[[Pacific Union]]"

===European Union===
[[File:Locator European Union.svg|thumb|right|150px|Map of [[European Union]] nations]]

The most relevant model{{peacock-inline|date=July 2018}} for the incremental establishment of a global federation may be the [[European Union]] (EU), which politically unites a large group of widely diverse (and some formerly hostile) nations spread over a large geographical area and encompassing over 500 million people. Although the EU is still evolving, it already has many attributes of a federal government such as open internal borders, a directly elected parliament, a court system, an official currency ([[Euro]]), and a centralized economic policy. A treaty change would be needed to allow for enlargement of the Union beyond the European continent.&lt;ref name="gissac1"&gt;Bart Gissac "Idées pour l'Union", ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'', 5 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's example is being followed by the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Organization of Central American States]], and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-eight European states.  It has developed a "single market" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without a passport.  This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading.  The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money.  Not all EU member states use the Euro; the United Kingdom, for example, retains the [[pound sterling]].  Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.  Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union.

===NATO===
[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[NATO]] nations]]

The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of [[collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in [[Brussels]], Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22&amp;nbsp;countries participate in NATO's "[[Partnership for Peace]]", with 15&amp;nbsp;other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|the world's defence spending]].&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CARICOM===
[[File:CARICOM Map 2010-2.png|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[CARICOM]] nations]]

The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), is an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.

Since the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ).

===African Union===
[[File:African Union (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|150px|right|Map of [[African Union]] nations]]

The [[African Union]] (AU) is an organisation consisting of all the 55 [[Africa]]n states of the continent and African waters. Established on July 9, 2002, the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State.{{Citation needed|date = July 2014}} The purpose of the union is to help secure Africa's [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and a [[Economy of Africa|sustainable economy]], especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.

Projects for improved economic and political cooperation are also happening at a regional level with the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[East African Community]].

===Organisation of Islamic Cooperation===
[[Image:OIC map.png|thumb|left|Map of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members (green) and observers (red)]]

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organisation]] with a permanent delegation to the [[United Nations]]. It groups 57 member states, from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. The organization claims it represents the Global Islamic World (''[[ummah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|title="The Organization has the singular honor to galvanize the Ummah into a unified body and have actively represented the Muslims by espousing all causes close to the hearts of over 1.5 billion Muslims of the world."|author=|date=|website=oic-oci.org|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926165053/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|archive-date=2015-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of the organisation are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Since the 19th century, many [[Muslims]] have aspired to uniting the Muslim ''ummah'' to serve their common political, economic and social interests. Despite the presence of secularist, nationalist and socialist ideologies in modern Muslim states, they have cooperated to form the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The formation of the OIC happened in the backdrop of the loss of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The final cause sufficiently compelled leaders of Muslim nations to meet in Rabat to establish the OIC on September 25, 1969.&lt;ref name=EIMW&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |title={title} |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314053224/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |archive-date=2010-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=January 2013}}

According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name=EIMW/&gt;

On August 5, 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.&lt;ref name=CDHRII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam|date=August 5, 1990|access-date=2010-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093031/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|archive-date=2010-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkic Council===
[[File:Conseilturcique.svg|thumb|210px|left|{{legend|#00a8a6|Official members}} {{legend|#4fa6cf|Prospective future members}} {{legend|#4fa62e|[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]&lt;br/&gt;{{pad|1.65em}}{{small|(only recognized by [[Turkey]])}}}}]]

The [[Turkic Council]] is an international organization comprising Turkic countries. Since 1992, the ''Turkic Language Speaking Countries Summit'' has been organizing amongst the Turkic countries. On October 3, 2009, four of these countries signed the Nahcivan Agreement. The organizational center is [[İstanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.

{{Marxism|History}}
{{Left communism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''World revolution''' is the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of overthrowing [[capitalism]] in all countries through the [[class consciousness|conscious]] revolutionary action of the organized [[working class]]. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a [[revolutionary party]] to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a [[workers' state]] based on [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. In most Marxist schools, such as [[Trotskyism]], the essentially international character of the [[class struggle]] and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of [[socialism in one country]].

The end goal of such internationally oriented [[revolutionary socialism]] is to achieve [[world socialism]], and later, [[stateless communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1933/teaching/4.htm The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism] by [[Bukharin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm The State and Revolution — Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist movements==
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917  in Russia sparked a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[socialist]] and [[communist]] uprisings across Europe, most notably the [[German Revolution]], the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution]], [[Biennio Rosso]] and the [[Finnish Civil War|revolutionary war in Finland]] with the short lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also [[Revolutions of 1917-23]].

Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that [[capitalism]] would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the [[Comintern]], founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the [[Russian Civil War]] into an essentially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide.
{{rquote|right|Revolutions are the locomotives of history.| [[Karl Marx]] &lt;ref&gt;''Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above 1928-1941'' by Robert C. Tucker, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992, {{ISBN|0-393-30869-3}}, pg 608&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see ''[[Socialism in one country]]''.

After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again.
As [[fascism]] grew in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the [[Comintern]] opted for a [[Popular Front]] with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of [[World War II]] in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's [[Western world|Western]] allies.

===After World War II===
A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the [[aftermath of World War II]], though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of [[anti-fascist]] resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in [[Eastern Europe]], meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power.  Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], who also were integral in repelling fascism during World War II.

Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], the establishment of the [[New Left]] together with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the militancy of the [[Black Panther Party]] and similar armed/insurrectionary "Liberation Front" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the [[labor movement]] for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, "The East is Red, and the West is Ready". However, this [[Far left|radical left]] spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain [[right-wing]], economically [[conservatism|conservative]] ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by [[Thatcherism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Reaganomics]] in the [[United States]]) and also [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|free-market reforms in China]] and [[doi moi|in Vietnam]].

Within [[Marxist theory]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s concept of the [[labor aristocracy]] and his description of [[imperialism]], and{{spaced ndash}}separately, but not necessarily unrelatedly{{spaced ndash}}[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s theories regarding the [[deformed workers' state]], offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of [[proletarian internationalism]].
