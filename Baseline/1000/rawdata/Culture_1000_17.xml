'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.

[[File:Armen Avanessian.jpg|alt=Armen Avanessian speaks at "Images of Surveillance" at the Goethe Institut New York in 2016|thumb|Armen Avanessian speaks at "Images of Surveillance" at the Goethe Institut New York in 2016]]
'''Armen Avanessian''' (*1973 in [[Vienna]]) is an Austrian philosopher, literary theorist, and political theorist. He has taught at the [[Free University of Berlin]], among other institutions, and held fellowships in the German departments of [[Columbia University]] and [[Yale University]]. His work on [[Speculative realism|Speculative Realism]] and [[Accelerationism]] in art and philosophy has found a wide audience beyond academia.

== Life ==
Of Armenian descent, born 1973 in Vienna, Armen Avanessian studied philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we03/institut/mitarbeiter/ehemalige/avanessian/index.html|title=Armen Avanessian|date=2008-07-30|website=www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political science under [[Jacques Rancière]] in Paris. He completed his dissertation, 'Phenomenology of Ironic Spirit: Ethics, Poetics, and Politics in Modernity' , under the supervision of conservative theorist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] at the [[University of Bielefeld]]. For several years, he worked as a free-lance journalist, journal editor (Le Philosophoire, Paris), and in the publishing industry in London.

From 2007 to 2014, he taught in the Peter Szondi Institute for Comparative Literature at the Free University of Berlin. In 2011 he was a Visiting Fellow in the German Department at [[Columbia University]] and in 2012 in the German Department at [[Yale University]]. Since 2013, he has held visiting appointments at a number of art schools (in Nuremberg, Vienna, Basel, Copenhagen, California&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2015/10/06/aesthetics-politics-program-welcomes-armen-avanessian/|title=Aesthetics &amp; Politics Program Welcomes Armen Avanessian|website=24700|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2014, he became the chief editor at Merve Verlag, a Berlin publisher specializing in philosophy and political theory. In 2011, Armen Avanessian founded the bilingual research and publication platform Speculative Poetics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spekulative-poetik.de/|title=Programmatik des Projekts - Spekulative Poetik - Spekulative Poetik|website=www.spekulative-poetik.de|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that brings together philosophers, writers, and artists from across the world around the idea of a new theoretical discipline in the making.

== Career ==
Following his dissertation, which had already explored phenomena at the intersection of art, politics, and philosophy, Avanessian focused on developing a new approach in literary theory and philosophy of language. Collaborating with colleagues such as Anke Hennig, he began working in 2011 on connecting new speculative-ontological approaches with twentieth-century philosophies of language, which resulted most notably in two co-written books, 'Present Tense: A Poetics' (2012, English translation 2015) and 'Metanoia: A Speculative Ontology of Language, Thinking, and the Brain' (2014, English translation forthcoming 2016). Moreover, he played a central role in bringing accelerationism into German-language political philosophy. In 2015, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] named him an intellectual innovator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WIRED Germany|title=Armen Avanessian // Die Innovatoren und Vordenker 2015|date=2015-01-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmg87gmsAA|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting in particular his concern with post-capitalist ideas.

Avanessian’s work has come to be situated primarily outside the academy. It includes widely discussed statements on current affairs such as the [[European migrant crisis|refugee crisis]], numerous lectures in the international art and culture scene, as well as a large number of interviews and intellectual portraits. Beyond the classical academic mainstream, Avanessian has repeatedly managed to introduce new concepts and theoretical constellations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spikeartmagazine.com/de/artikel/armen-avanessian-theorien-fur-das-21-jahrhundert|title=Armen Avanessian: Theorien für das 21. Jahrhundert|date=2015-04-02|website=Spike Art Daily|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; into public discourse. These consist partly of neologisms, partly of concepts used in smaller circles, which Avanessian’s work as editor re-produces for the German-language context. Examples include “speculative realism,” “acceleration,” “Xenofeminism,” “hyperstition,” and, most recently, the concept of the “time complex: postcontemporary.” Hyperstition, moreover, is not just another concept, it also designates a method, namely the actualization in the present, from out of the future, of ideas or fictions.

Avanessian’s books have been translated into several languages, including English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, and French.

== Literary Studies ==
Avanessian’s early publications are mostly scholarly books and essays on linguistics, semantics, and literary studies. His philosophical breakthrough came with the edited volumes on 'Speculative Realism' (Realism Now) and the German edition of the reader, '#Acceleration'. His move to Merve has emphasized his focus on editing current, not yet established philosophy, treating, in particular, questions in feminism, finance theory, and technology. He has also published books discussing the possibility of poeticizing philosophy.

His book 'Overwrite: Ethics of Knowledge, Poetics of Existence' (2015, English translation forthcoming) confronts the deplorable state of academia in an explicitly accelerationist way. Not limiting himself to mere criticism, Avanessian is constantly at work constructing alternative platforms such as the summer school he organized with [[Reza Negarestani]] and Pete Wolfendale at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, on “Emancipation as Navigation: From the Space of Reasons to the Space of Freedoms.”

== Art ==
Avanessian’s recently intensified activity in the field of art can also be understood as that of a postcontemporary artist trying to combine speculative questions in philosophy and art and make them accessible to a larger public. To that end, he uses not only classical publication formats in print, film projects, and academic lectures but also art festivals and exhibitions. The 2015 gallery festival “Tomorrow Today / curated by_vienna”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/141988278|title=viennacontemporary 2015 {{!}} Talk: curated by_vienna: Tomorrow Today|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, was based on Avanessian’s homonymous essay and combined the work of twenty well-known curators with the idea of an actual post-capitalism. Within the framework of the ninth Berlin Biennale, Avanessian conducted a ten-day Young Curators Workshop on alternatives to the economic and political models of contemporary art.

An analogous sense of discontent with the state of political theory and practice and with the lack of efficacy of political art led to the idea of a democratic and transparent intelligence agency named DISCREET,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/165568437|title=discreet|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will be founded by Alexander Martos and Avanessian, as artist, in the course of  multi-week project at the 2016 Berlin Biennale. Armen Avanessian is a regular contributor to art journals such as Spike, Texte zur Kunst, and DIS Magazine. He also writes frequently about art in philosophical contexts. For several years now, Avanessian has collaborated with the graphic artist, Andreas Töpfer, which has led to publications in print (with Merve and Sternberg Press) and on film.

== Radio ==
With columnist Georg Diez, media theorist Paul Feigelfeld, and author Julia Zange, Armen Avanessian hosts “60 Hertz” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlincommunityradio.com/60hz|title=60HZ|date=2016-03-23|website=Berlin Community Radio|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a talk show airing every Monday on Berlin Community Radio. The show is conceived as an artistic rendering, in interviews and conversations, of everyday life in the 2010s. Episodes are usually broadcast in a mix of English and German language.

== Film ==
With Berlin director Christopher Roth, he has produced the film ''Hyperstition''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dismagazine.com/blog/77351/hyperstition-truth-is-science-is-fiction/|title=Hyperstition: Truth is Science is Fiction|last=Toro|first=Lauren Boyle, Solomon Chase, Marco Roso, Nick Scholl, David|website=DIS Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016), which draws on ontology, science fiction, and sociology to question the concept of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146435027|title=HYPERSTITION 15 minutes out of 102 about Time &amp; Narrative|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screened at several festivals in Europe and the United States, the film consists of conversations with established as well as younger philosophers such as [[Nick Srnicek]], Elie Ayache, [[Ray Brassier]] and others.

[[Image:Bisbuffalorace.jpg|thumb|300px|[[domestic buffalo|Water Buffalo]] racing at Babulang 2006]]
'''Babulang''' is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional [[Bisaya (Borneo)]] community of Limbang, [[Sarawak]]. It is a joyful occasion; involving many people; and incurs quite a substantial amount of expenditure to organize. The festival showcases various music, songs, and dances; displaying colourful traditional costumes; decorations and handicrafts. 

It is only during 'Babulang' that these Bisaya's dances, songs, handicrafts and hospitality to their guests are on display. 

Highlights are the [https://sarawaktourism.com/event/buffalo-race-festival-babulang/ Ratu Babulang] competition and the [[domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] races which can only be found in this town in [[Sarawak]].

{{Wiktionary|beauf}}
'''''Beauf''''' [pronounced /bof/] is a [[French language|French]] term describing a man perceived as vulgar, unintelligent, arrogant, uncaring, misogynistic and [[chauvinist]]ic, without any taste for etiquette or good manners. A "beauf" will typically be prompt to jump to conclusions and have strong views on complex social issues, based on an insufficient analysis of the facts, but presented as being plain common sense.

French [[cartoonist]] [[Cabu]] was responsible for popularising the term, which is an abbreviation of "beau-frère" ([[brother-in-law]]) by creating a cartoon character of that name in [[Charlie Hebdo]] in the mid-1970s.  Singer [[Renaud Séchan|Renaud]] also released a song titled "Mon Beauf"  in 1981.  Cabu updated the character later in ''[[Le Canard Enchainé]]'' under the title "Les nouveaux beaufs".  The new version is a more urban and trendy version, with a ponytail instead of a bushy moustache. Nouveaux beaufs drive four-by-fours/[[SUV]]s, and are fans of [[plastic surgery]].

[[Image:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] in a red fur-lined gown with split hanging sleeves, a men's fashion of the mid-16th century]]

Despite the constant introduction of new terms by [[fashion designer]]s, clothing manufacturers, and marketers, the names for several basic garment classes in English are very stable over time.  ''Gown'', ''shirt/skirt'', ''frock'', and ''coat'' are all attested back to the early [[medieval]] period.

''Gown'' (from [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] ''gunna'') was a basic clothing term for hundreds of years, referring to a garment that hangs from the shoulders.  In [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] England ''gown'' referred to a loose outer garment worn by both men and women, sometimes short, more often ankle length, with [[sleeve]]s.  By the 18th century ''gown'' had become a standard category term for a women's [[dress]], a meaning it retained until the mid-20th century.  Only in the last few decades has ''gown'' lost this general meaning in favor of ''dress''.  Today the term ''gown'' is rare except in specialized cases: [[academic dress]] or ''cap and gown'', [[evening gown]], [[nightgown]], [[hospital gown]], and so on (''see'' [[Gown]]).

''Shirt'' and ''skirt'' are originally the same word, the former being the southern and the latter the northern pronunciation in early [[Middle English]].

''Coat'' remains a term for an overgarment, its essential meaning for the last thousand years (''see'' [[Coat (clothing)|Coat]]).

== New sources ==

Names for new styles or fashions in clothing are frequently the deliberate inventions of fashion designers or clothing manufacturers; these include [[Chanel]]'s [[Little Black Dress]] (a term which has survived) and [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]]'s ''[[Robe|robe de style]]'' (which has not). Other terms are of more obscure origin.

=== Personal names ===

Clothing styles are frequently named after people—often with a military connection:
*The ''[[Jinnah Cap]]''  is a fur qaraqul hat named after the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali [[Jinnah]]. 
*The ''Garibaldi jacket'' or [[Garibaldi shirt]] were bright red woolen garments for women with black [[embroidery]] or braid and military details popular in the [[1860s in fashion|1860s]]; they are named after the Italian revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who visited England in 1863.
*The [[Eisenhower jacket]] or "Ike" jacket is a waist-length, military jacket of World War II origins.  Called the "Jacket, Field, Wool, M-1944", it was commissioned by then [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Dwight Eisenhower]] as a new field jacket for the US Forces in Northern Europe.  The jacket was based on the British Army 'Battle Dress' jacket of the same era.
*The ''[[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]'' is a [[knit]]ted jacket or button-front [[sweater]] created to keep British soldiers warm in Russian winters.  It is named for [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan]], who led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] in the [[Crimean War]] (1854).
*The ''[[Mao suit|Mao jacket]]'' is a very plain (often grey), high-collared, shirtlike jacket customarily worn by [[Mao Zedong]] and the people of China during his regime. Its drab design and uniformity was a reaction to pre-[[Revolution]] class distinctions of clothes, with elites dressing in elaborate silks, while poor laborers wore very rough clothes.
*The ''[[Nehru jacket]]'' is a uniform jacket without lapels or collars, popularized by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first Prime Minister of independent India.
*The ''[[Bloomer Costume]]'' was a type of women's clothing introduced in the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] period, that changed the style from dresses to a more male-type style, which was devised by [[Amelia Bloomer]].
*The ''[[Wellington boot]]'' was a cavalry boot devised by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], originally made from leather, but now normally rubber.
*The ''[[Stetson]] hat'' is named after the founder of the [[John B. Stetson Company]].
*The ''[[Mackintosh]]'' is a waterproof coat made from [[rubber]]ised [[textile|fabric]], named after its inventor [[Charles Macintosh]].
*The ''[[Gandhi cap]]'' is a white colored sidecap made from khadi. It was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement.

=== Place names ===

Another fertile source for clothing terms is place names, which usually reflect the origin (or supposed origin) of a fashion.  Modern terms such as Bermuda shorts, [[aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirts]], and [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle]] [[sweater]]s are the latest in a long line that stretches back to ''holland'' (linen), ''damask'' ("from [[Damascus]]"), ''[[polonaise (clothing)|polonaise]]'' ("in the fashion of [[Poland|Polish]] women"), ''[[Basque (clothing)|basque]]'', ''jersey'' (originally [[Jersey]] [[frock]]), ''[[Balaclava (clothing)|Balaclava]]'', ''[[Capri pants]]'', ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'',  and ''denim'' ("serge de [[Nîmes]]" after the city).

=== Costume historian's terms ===

Costume historians, with a "rearward-looking" view, require names for clothing styles that were not used (or needed) when the styles were actually worn. For example, the Van Dyke collar is so-called from its appearances in 17th century portraits by [[Anthony van Dyck]], and the Watteau pleats of the ''[[Sack-back gown|robe á la française]]'' are called after their appearance in the portraits of [[Antoine Watteau]].

Similarly, terms may be applied ahistorically to entire categories of garments, so that ''corset'' is applied to garments that were called ''stays'' or a ''pair of bodies'' until the introduction of the word ''corset'' in the late 18th century.  And ''dress'' is now applied to any women's garment consisting of a bodice and skirt, although for most of its history ''dress'' simply meant clothing, or a complete outfit of clothing with its appropriate accessories.

=== Short forms ===

A notable trend at the turn of the 21st century is "cute" short forms: [[camisole]] becomes ''cami'', hooded sweaters or [[sweatshirt]]s become ''hoodies'', and as of 2005, short or "shrunken" cardigans are ''cardies''.

The much-older term ''shimmy'' for "slip" is most likely a [[false singular]] from [[chemise]].

'''Coolhunting''' is a [[neologism]] coined in the early 1990s referring to a new kind of [[marketing]] professionals who make [[observation]]s and [[prediction]]s in changes of new or existing  [[Cool (aesthetic)|"cool"]] cultural [[fads and trends]]. Coolhunting is also referred to as "trend spotting," and is a subset of [[trend analysis]].

Coolhunters resemble the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] fashion magazine editors of the 1960s such as [[Nancy White (editor)|Nancy White]] (''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' 1958–1971).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Coolhunters operate mostly in the world of [[street fashion]] and [[design]], but their work also blurs into that of [[Futurology|futurists]] such as [[Faith Popcorn]].

==Business model==

A  coolhunting firm  is a [[marketing agency]] whose exclusive purpose is to conduct [[research]] of the youth demographic. They then compile their data and produce reports detailing emerging and declining trends in [[youth culture]] as well as predictions for future trends. These reports are then sold to various companies whose products target the youth demographic. They also offer [[Consultant|consulting]] services. Coolhunting firms often provide services for some of the largest [[corporation]]s in the world.

Rather than [[outsourcing]] their [[market research]], some companies opt for  in-house  youth culture marketing divisions. These divisions act in much the same way as a coolhunting firm but the reports and data collected remain within the company and are used solely to promote its products. A company will often prefer this form of coolhunting as a way to gain an advantage in the valuable youth market since the research conducted by coolhunting firms is available to anyone willing to pay for it.   [[Viacom]]'s [[MTV]] television network employs  in-house coolhunting.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

==Methods and practices==
Coolhunting is  more than simple [[market research]] because of the nature of the subjects. The teen and preteen market is often referred to as a "stubborn" demographic in that they do not respond as well to blatant [[advertising]] and marketing campaigns targeted at them. Coolhunters therefore must be more stealthy in their methods of gathering information and data.

[[Focus group]]s, though quite obvious in their attempts at gathering information, are very popular among coolhunters as they provide direct insight into the [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s of their target [[demographic]].  Coolhunters will typically gather a group of randomly selected individuals from their target demographic. While one or more market researchers interact with the group, they are often being monitored and [[Document|recorded]] by a non-visible group, because not only do coolhunters want to ''hear'' what their subjects have to say, they also want to ''observe'' their simple mannerisms.

Depending on the nature of the study, the methods of the [[information gathering|information-gathering]] during a focus group interview may be extremely broad, with questions relating to lifestyle and youth culture, or more specific, like comparing certain [[brand]]s and determining which brands the group is most responsive to.

Participants in focus groups are usually rewarded for their participation, whether it be a cash amount, free products, or other rewards.

Coolhunters will often seek out individuals from within their target demographic who are regarded as [[leader]]s or trendsetters. They will then hire these individuals to be ''Cool Narcs'', who gather information secretly among their peers and report their findings back to their employers. This is a popular method of coolhunting as it provides insight into their target demographic within their natural environment.

There are a wide variety of methods for conducting market research online. Popular examples are online [[statistical survey|survey]]s where upon completion, the participant will usually receive a prize or monetary compensation. Other times coolhunters will enter [[chatroom]]s and webgroups posing as an individual within the target demographic and gather information.

In the [[social science]]s, '''coordinated management of meaning''' ('''CMM''') provides understanding of how individuals create, coordinate and manage meanings in their process of communication. Generally, it refers to "how individuals establish rules for creating and interpreting meaning and how those rules are enmeshed in a conversation where meaning is constantly being coordinated".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application (3rd Edition)|last = West|first = Richard|publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year = |isbn = 978-0-07-313561-8|location = |pages = 111|last2 = Turner|first2 = Lynn H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People live in a world where there is constant communication. In communicating with others, people assign meanings in their messages based on past [[conversation]]al experiences from previous social realities. Through communication, an underlying process takes place in which individuals negotiate a common or conflicted meanings of the world around them, thereby creating a new social reality. CMM advocates that meanings can be managed in a productive way so as to improve the state of interactions by coordinating and managing the [[meaning-making]] process.

CMM  relies on three interdependent elements: coordination, management and meaning. These elements help to explain how social realities are created through conversation.

== History and orientation ==
The theory of CMM was developed in the mid-1970s by W. Barnett Pearce (1943 - 2011) and Vernon E. Cronen. Communication Action and Meaning was devoted to CMM, is thorough explication of CMM, which Pearce and Cronen introduced to the common scholarly vernacular of the discipline. Their scholarly collaboration at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts at Amherst]] offered a major contribution to the philosophy of communication as story-centered, applicable, and ever attentive to the importance of human meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronald C|first=Arnett|year=2013|title=Philosophy Of Communication As Carrier Of Meaning: Adieu To W. Barnett Pearce|url=|journal=Qualitative Research Reports In|volume=14.1|pages=1–9|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster of ideas in which CMM emerged has moved from the periphery toward greater acceptance and CMM has continued to evolve along a trajectory from an interpretive [[social science]] to one with a critical edge and then to what its founders call a "practical theory".

Aware that the intellectual footing for communication theory had shifted, the first phase of the CMM project involved developing concepts that met the twin criteria of (1) adequately expressing the richness of human communication and (2) guiding empirical investigation. Pearce describes the creation of CMM through the following story:&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|align=center|...I think that I am the first person ever to use the awkward phrase "coordinated management of meaning".  Of course, tones of voice are often more informative than the verbal content of what is said, and struggle and frustration were expressed in the tones of voice in which "CMM" was first said. For years, I had been trying to bring together what I was learning from social science research, rhetorical studies, philosophy, theology, and, in my father's term, the "School of Hard Knocks". I felt that most of the models of communication that I knew were useful but that all were limited and limiting in some important ways, and that I had to invent something that was better.

Communication is about ''meaning'',... but not just in a passive sense of perceiving messages. Rather, we live in lives filled with meanings and one of our life challenges is to ''manage'' those meanings so that we can make our social worlds coherent and live within them with honor and respect. But this process of managing our meanings is never done in isolation. We are always and necessarily ''coordinating'' the way we manage our meanings with other people. So, I concluded, communication is about the coordinated management of meaning.|''W. Barnett Pearce''}}

CMM is one of an increasing number of theories that see communication as "[[performative]]" (doing things, not just talking "about" them) and "constitutive" (the material substance of the social world, not just a means of transmitting information within it). In CMM-speak, "taking the communication perspective" means looking at communication rather than through it, and seeing communication as the means by which we make the objects and events of our social worlds.

The "communication perspective" entails a shift in focus from [[theory]] to [[wikt:praxis|praxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronen 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM concepts and models are best understood as providing tools for naming aspects of performance. To date, CMM has found greater acceptance among practitioners than among scholars. Taking the communication perspective confers something like "communication literacy"—the ability to inscribe and read the complex process of communication in real time. Among other things, CMM's concepts and models guide practitioners in helping clients become aware of the patterns of communication which make up aspects of the social world. They want to change and help both clients and practitioners identify openings or "[[bifurcation point]]s" in everyday lives. Many CMM practitioners have an explicit commitment not only to describe and understand, but to improve the conditions in which they and those around them live. They believe that the best way of making better social worlds is to improve the patterns of communication which generates them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that "CMM theory is a kind of [[multi-tool]] (like a '[[Swiss army knife]]') that is useful in any situation".&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a single theory, but rather a collection of ideas to understand how humans interact during communication. According to CMM, individuals construct their own social realities while engaged in conversation. To put it simply, communicators apply rules in order to understand what is going on during their social interaction. Based on the situation, different rules are applied in order to produce "better" patterns of communication.&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12"&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMM theory is a fairly complex study focusing on both the complexity in the micro-social processes and the aspects of daily interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it is concerned with how we coordinate and establish meaning during interactions. The theory can be complicated to teach and/or present to others, but it is best understood when it is broken down into the basics. The theory consists of three key concepts, which are further broken down into several different building blocks.

The fundamental building blocks of CMM theory focus specifically on the flow of communication between people. The three different concepts experienced either [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]], are coordination, management and meaning.

===1. Coordination.===
Coordination refers to "the degree to which persons perceive that their actions have fitted together into some mutually intelligible sequence or pattern of actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Watershed research traditions in human communication theory|last = Gerry|first = Phillipsen|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists "when two people attempt to make sense out of the sequencing of messages in their conversation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is, if people in the interaction can recognize what their partners are talking about, then we say the conversation come to a coordination. Scientists believes that people's desire for coordination in interaction arises from the subjectivity of meaning, which means the same message may have different meanings to different people. In order to avoid this pitfall in communication, people work together to share meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessing belief in coordinating meaning in romantic relationships|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that [[Sensemaking|sense making]] is the foundation of coordination. By tokens within the information connected by means of channel can the logic relationship emerges, then it contributes to the sense making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Progressive Ontology Alignment for Meaning Coordination: An Information-theoretic Foundation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1082473.1082586|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Fourth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|date = 2005-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-59593-093-0|pages = 737–744|series = AAMAS '05|doi = 10.1145/1082473.1082586|first = Marco|last = Schorlemmer|first2 = Yannis|last2 = Kalfoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense making helps people to establish common understanding then further develops coordination between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Common understanding as a basis for coordination|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13563280810869587|journal = Corporate Communications: An International Journal|date = 2008-05-09|issn = 1356-3289|pages = 147–167|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/13563280810869587 | last1 = Jaatinen | first1 = Miia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of coordination has to do with the fact that our actions do not stand alone with regard to communication. The words or actions that we use during a conversation come together to produce patterns. These patterns, also known as stories lived, influence the behavior used during each interaction as a way to collaborate. Pearce and Cronen are quick to point out that coordination does not imply a commitment to coordinate "smoothly", but rather the concept is meant to provide the basis for being mindful of the other side of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three possible outcome of coordination:

1. People in the interaction achieve coordination.

2. People in the interaction failed to achieve coordination.

3. People in the interaction achieve some degree of coordination.

If the interaction fail to achieve coordination or achieve partially coordination, the possible solution is to move the level of meaning to another level.

===2. Management===
Our interactions are guided and defined by rules. "Interactants must understand the social reality and then incorporate rules as they decide how to act in a given situation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the use of rules, individuals manage and coordinate meanings in the conversation. "Once rules are established in a [[dialogue]], interactants will have a sufficiently common symbolic framework for communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An approach to communication theory: Toward consensus on rules|date = 1972|journal = Journal of Communication|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1972.tb00149.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=22 |pages=217–238 | last1 = Cushman | first1 = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it would be ambiguous if a friend says "I hate you". Does the friend really hate whomever he/she is speaking to or he/she is just expressing his/her feelings at the moment? Rules will help clarify and explain this kind of meanings.
* '''Constitutive rules''': refer to "how behavior should be interpreted within a given context".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It tells us what the given behavior means and linking belief to one another and behaviors to beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerald W|first=Driskill|year=1995|title=Managing Cultural Differences: A Rules Analysis In A Bicultural Organization|url=|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=5.4|pages=353–379|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example above, "I hate you" in some contexts counts as an expression of slight dissatisfaction. 
* '''Regulative rules''': refer to "some sequence of action that an individual undertakes, and they communicate what happens next in a conversation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they are also referred as "cognitive reorganizations of constitutive rules" &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other word, it means the behavior that is requested in certain situation. Regulative rules link the meanings in the interaction with the consequences they result to. Our body reaction can reflect on the contents of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Keep meaning in conversational coordination|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397/abstract|journal = Cognitive Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4253663|pmid = 25520693|pages = 1397|volume = 5|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397|first = Elena C.|last = Cuffari}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"Unwanted repetitive patterns":''' It refers to "the sequential and recurring conflictual episodes that are considered unwanted by the individuals in the conflict."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phenomenon happens because "two people with particular rule systems follow a structure that obligates them to perform specific behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several reasons count for unwanted repetitive patterns. First, sometimes people can't find other options than being in conflict. Second, people may feel comfortable in the conflict situation because they have experience on what others will behave in this kind of situation. Third, people may be tired of finding resolution on the conflict situation.
* '''"Not everything within communication can be explained."''', which is called Mystery. It is the recognition that "the world and our experience of it is more than any of the particular stories that make it coherent or any of the activities in which we engage".&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12" /&gt; Mystery has to do with the sense of awe or wonder when communication leads to a surprising outcome. Put more simply, it is the feeling (anything from attraction to hate) one experiences when engaged in conversation that cannot be linked to the situation as a whole.

CMM theory sees each conversation as a complex interconnected series of events in which each individual affects and is affected by the other. Although the primary emphasis of CMM theory has to do with the concept of first person communication, known as a [[participatory]] view, once the concepts are understood they are more readily visible during other interactions. Furthermore, this knowledge can be applied to similar situations which will in turn lead to more effective communication.

=== 3. Meaning ===
Coordinated management of meaning states that people "organize meaning in a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] manner." Theorists on CMM was in agreement on two points regarding hierarchical meaning. "First, the hierarchical of meaning defines the context in which regulative and constitutive rules are to be understood. Second, these contexts are arranged in a hierarchical af abstractness, such that higher levels of the hierarchy help to define – and may subsume – lower level."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Theories, Perspectives, Processes, and contexts|publisher = |year = |isbn = 0-07-293794-7|location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interpreted  to each of the contexts in the "hierarchical can be understood by looking at the other contexts, and each contexts is always contextualizing other contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eerika|first=Hedman|last2=Gesch-Karamanlidis|first2=Eleni|date=|year=2015|title=Facilitating Conversations That Matter Using Coordinated Management Of Meaning Theory|url=|journal=OD Practitioner|volume=47.2|pages=|via=1. Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six levels of meaning. ''Levels below are illustrated from lower level to higher level.''

====(1) Content====
The content or [[message]] according to CMM theory relates to the raw data and information spoken aloud during communication.To put it simply, content is the words used to communicate. The content is essentially the basic building blocks of any [[language]]; however, it is important to note that the content by itself is not sufficient to establish the meaning of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;HFCL Tutorial 2008, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====(2) Speech act====
Another integral part of the CMM theory includes the [[speech act]].  "Speech acts communicate the intention of the speaker and indicate how a particular communication should be taken."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The simplest explanation of a speech act is "actions that you perform by speaking. They include compliments, insults, promises, [[wikt:threat|threats]], assertions, and questions".&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 1994, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM theory draws upon the [[speech act theory]], which further breaks down speech acts into separate categories of sounds or utterances. Though the speech act theory is much more detailed, it is important to have an understanding of both [[illocutionary]] and [[perlocutionary]] utterances.

* An ''illocutionary utterance'' is speech that intends to make contact with a receiver.
* A ''perlocutionary utterance'' includes speech that intends to alter the behavior of the receiver.

There are many different utterances or speech acts including questions, answers, commands, promises and statements. Having knowledge of each of these plays a large part in an individual being able to participate in a communications exchange.

====(3) Episodes====
An episode is a situation created by persons in a conversation. The same content can take on different meaning when the situation is different. For example, a phrase used among close family or friends may take on an entirely different meaning in a job interview. In the interactions, people may punctuate differently on a same episode. This will result to people deal with the differences on their punctuations on subsequent episodes. Especially when people situated the bi-cultural or multi-cultural situation has identified a number of specific acts which occurred in an equivalent situation in the other culture, would have totally disrupted the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Wolfson|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|year=1983|title=A Cross-Cultural Comparison Of The Implications Of Self-Disclosure On Conversational Logics|url=|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=31.3|pages=249–256|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.|doi=10.1080/01463378309369511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====(4) Relationship====
Relationship is the higher level of the meaning, where "relational boundaries in that parameters are established for attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This building block is fairly easy to understand as it is the dynamic of what connects two (or more) individuals during an exchange of information. Examples of a [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] could be defined as a parent/child, teacher/student, strangers, etc. Communication between strangers would likely be different from conversations amongst family members.

====(5) Life scripts====

Life scripts can be understood as the patterns of episodes. On this level, "every individual's history of relationships and interactions will influence rules and interaction patterns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Life scripts are similar to the [[autobiography]] of individuals. It comprises the person's exceptions for variety communicative events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron E|first=Cronen|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|last3=Harris|first3=Linda M|year=1979|title=The Logic Of The Coordinated Management Of Meaning: A Rules-Based Approach To The First Course In Interpersonal Communication.|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=28.1|pages=22–38|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several CMM texts describe this building block as a "script for who we are" as the role an individual plays in the movie of life. For example, an individual may believe they are funny, and therefore may act according to that perspective while engaged in different conversations.

====(6) Cultural patterns====
The concept of culture in CMM theory relates to a set of rules for acting and speaking which govern what we understand to be normal in a given episode. There are different rules for [[social interaction]] depending on the culture. To some extent, during communication individuals act in accordance with their cultural values. While we often don't even realize that culture impacts communication during day to day interactions, people must learn to be compatible with individuals from different cultures in order to have effective communication.

==Models and applications==
Pearce is adamant that CMM is not just an interpretive theory but is meant to be a practical theory as well.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive literature involving the use of CMM to address [[family violence]], intra-community relations, [[workplace conflict]] and many other [[social issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, et al. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sundarajan and Spano 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce and Pearce 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A research employs CMM to understand the "perceived acts of discrimination manifested within the context of everyday interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defining discrimination across cultural groups: Exploring the [un-]coordinated management of meaning|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176710000088|journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date = 2010-05-01|pages = 283–293|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004|first = Mark P.|last = Orbe|first2 = Sakile K.|last2 = Camara}}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying CMM into research, the researchers are able to explicate the rules of meaning-making that majority and minority groups followed in understanding the discrimination act. Another application example was done in 1994 when CMM was initially recognized by people. It believes that the framework of CMM provides an understanding of "the structure and process of consumer decision making by placing those decisions within the context of a family's social reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Co‐ordinated Management of Meaning: A Case Exemplar of a New Consumer Research Technologynull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090569410067640|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = 1994-08-01|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 76–99|volume = 28|issue = 8/9|doi = 10.1108/03090569410067640 | last1 = Buttle | first1 = Francis A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along this line, CMM theorists have used or developed several [[analysis]] [[scientific modelling|models]] to help understand and improve communication. The models addressed here are the hierarchy model, the serpentine model, charmed and strange loops. Examples for the first model have been adapted from ones Pearce uses in one of his writings where he analyzes the courtroom conversation between [[Ramzi Yousef]], the individual convicted of bombing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 1994, and Kevin T. Duffy, the [[federal judge]] who presided over his trial. In Yousef's statement before sentencing, he criticizes the US for its hypocrisy; he accuses the US of being the premier [[terrorist]], and reasserts his pride in his fight against the US. At the sentencing, Duffy accuses Yousef of being a virus, evil, perverting the principles of [[Islam]], and interested only in death. Neither individual really talks to the other, but rather at them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1. Hierarchy model===
The hierarchy model is the hierarchy of organized meanings as illustrated in the "[[#3. Meaning|Meaning]]" section. The hierarchy model is a tool for an individual to explore the perspectives of their conversational partners while also enabling them to take a more thorough look at their own personal [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. The elements at the top of each list form the overall context in which each story takes place and have an influence on the elements below them. The levels of meaning from lowest to highest are: content, speech act, episodes, relationship, life scripts, and cultural patterns.

Stephen W. Littlejohn and Karen A. Foss in their book ''Theories of Human Communication'' (Tenth Edition)&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W., and Karen A. Foss. "Chapter 6: The Conversation." Theories of Human Communication. Long Grove, IL: Waveland, 2017. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a type of logical force called contextual force. Contextual force causes a person to follow a form of logic that leads one to believe that an action or interpretation is a direct result of, and is appropriate to, the context. For example, "How else could I have reacted?" or "Naturally I acted that way, it was appropriate to the situation," leads to the mentality of "I did what I had to do." Secondly, in CMM contexts are extremely important and they are not static and unchanging. For example, a relationship that is longstanding can contextualize the episode of an ugly argument as something unpleasant, but unavoidable. The couple will most likely worth though this ugly argument because of their relationship contextualizing the episode. However, an episode of an ugly argument can contextualize a relationship if a couple is on their first date. Therefore the argument is more likely to contextualize the relationship is over or not worth pursuing. What contextualizes what in the hierarchy of organized meanings overlaps and is interlinked in a complicated hierarchy of meanings which can shift at any moment.

===2. Serpentine model===
The CMM theorists take the hierarchy model a step further by reinforcing the importance of interaction and adding the aspect of time. Pearce stresses that communication cannot be done alone and that furthermore this usually occurs before or after another's actions. Therefore, understanding past events and their impact on individuals is essential to improving communication. This new model is called the serpentine model and visually demonstrates how communication is a back and forth interaction between participants rather than just a simple transmission of information.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. Charmed and strange loop===
The embedded contexts illustrated in the hierarchy model represent a stable [[hierarchy]]. It suggests that higher levels subsume lower levels. Meanwhile, sometimes "lower levels can reflect back and affect the meaning of higher levels."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is termed "loop". CMM believes that there is a stronger "contextual effect", which works from higher levels to the lower levels, and a weaker "implicative effect", which works the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tortured Families: A Coordinated Management of Meaning Analysis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x/abstract|journal = Family Process|date = 2004-09-01|issn = 1545-5300|pages = 349–371|volume = 43|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x|first = Edith|last = Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt; When loops are consistent with the hierarchy, it is identified as a "charmed loop".  In this kind of interaction, each person's perceptions and actions help to reinforce the other's perceptions and actions.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2004, p.9"&gt;Kearney 2004, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower levels are inconsistent with the higher levels, it is called a "strange loop". Essentially, "a 'strange' loop is a repetitive interactional pattern that alternates between [[contradictory]] meanings".&lt;ref&gt;Craig 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the alcoholic identifies that he is an alcoholic and then quits drinking. Since he has quit drinking, he convinces himself that he is not really an alcoholic and so he starts drinking again, which makes him an alcoholic. He alternates between contradictory [[perceptions]] of being an alcoholic and not being an alcoholic. The charmed and strange loop model also has its applications. In a research regarding the social construction of male college student logical forces, the charmed and strange loop model was utilized in studying male college students' narratives in describing their memorable sexual experiences.

Less commonly, there is a third variation called "subversive" loop. Texts and contexts within a subversive loop are mutually invalidating and can prevent coherence and coordination. It may result in intentionally outrageous behavior, efforts to act in uninterruptible ways, or refusal to recognize the possibility that the outsider can understand the situation of the insider.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4. Applications ===
CMM theory is regarding as kind of multi-tool by providing a framework to structure different themes. In this regard, there are lots of qualitative study using CMM to illustrate its utility for framing their findings. Because people interpret messages and know the rules or guide which can follow and have actions constitute appropriate responses. Now, its focus on cultural influence to get insights into how individuals negotiate complex messages occurring at different levels of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozhdeh B|first=Truss|year=2005|title=Food, Culture, And Family: Exploring The Coordinated Management Of Meaning Regarding Childhood Obesity|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=18.2|pages=155–175|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since CMM attempts to explain the process by group member to make sense out of the regular path of messages and carried out into a group conversation. So according to CMM, individual perspective with group approach conversation need to combine and create a better meaning-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Moore|last2=Laters|first2=Amy|year=2008|title=Coordinated Management Of Meaning In Chat Rooms|url=|journal=International Communication Association|volume=|pages=1–46|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Qualitative experiment framework tool  
* Online chat room user experience by applying CMM theory, conduct a textual analysis.
* Data analysis tool though on how people use complex, multilevel systems of reference to derive meaning and guide behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark P|first=Orbe|last2=Camara|first2=Skile K|year=2012|title=Defining Discrimination Across Cultural Groups: Exploring The [Un-]Coordinated Management Of Meaning.|url=|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=34.3|pages=283–293|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory criticism==
In order to provide criticism of the CMM theory, it is important to establish a baseline for what accounts for a "good" study. Many scholars use different criteria for determining what makes a theory relevant, but they most often surround the following six concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2001, p.4-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1: Theories should be evaluated on their ability to produce [[hypotheses]] that are consistent with relevant evidence. CMM theory falls short under the criteria of rule 1 as it does not set out to provide measureable hypotheses that can be compared to any other situation. While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different. 
* 2: General theories are preferred to less general theories. From the perspective of this rule, CMM theory is very general; however it is also very vague. The theory has difficulty focusing on exactly what is important in each interaction thereby not allowing those who study the theory to understand what is considered critical in a communicative interaction. 
* 3: Theories that produce several hypotheses are preferred to those that produce few. From this perspective, CMM theory fails as it neglects to have even a single hypothesis that is testable.
* 4: It is more beneficial to evaluate research programs rather than individual theories. As CMM theory focuses on levels of contact between two (or more) persons engaged in communication, these findings from CMM research contribute beyond mere observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danielle|first=Wiese|last2=Farrugia|first2=Rebekah|year=2009|title=Coordinating Communication On Facebook: An Analysis Of Meaning Development Through Close Relationships|url=|journal=Conference Papers -- National Communication Association|volume=|pages=|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unsuccessful as a way to evaluate anything other than individual interactions.
* 5: The overall implications of a theory mean that those with several are preferred over those with few. CMM theory focuses on how we create our social environments in the present, however it fails to predict how the theory can affect future events. 
* 6: Simplicity is considered a virtue. In accordance with this rule, CMM theory falls short. CMM is an extremely broad theory with many different terms, views and loopholes which makes a multifaceted study of communication even more complex
CMM has been criticized for too broad in its scope and highly abstract in its nature. "Poole wrote 'It is difficult ... to paint with broad strokes and at the same time give difficult areas the attention they deserve'.".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1987, Brenders also stated that "in its broad - stroked approach to human interaction, CMM has missed many of the linguistic, international, and theoretical nuances necessary for an understanding of communicative meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fallacies in the coordinated management of meaning: A philosophy of language critique of the hierarchical organization of coherent conversation and related theory.|date = 1987|journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech|doi = 10.1080/00335638709383812|pmid = |access-date = |volume=73 |pages=329–348 | last1 = Brenders | first1 = David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also criticized for its conceptual apparatus as "incomplete with regard to a full examination of the material layering of practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Proposal for Integrating Structuration Theory With Coordinated Management of Meaning Theory|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510970600666867|journal = Communication Studies|date = 2006-07-01|issn = 1051-0974|pages = 173–196|volume = 57|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10510970600666867|first = Randall A.|last = Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a humanistic perspective, CMM theory is seen as valuable as it seeks to provide a way to clarify communication for better interaction and understanding. Its utility lies in "how people achieve meaning, their potential recurring conflicts, and the influence of the self on the communication process is admirable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It promotes [[reform]] by encouraging individuals to explain particular viewpoints in order to reach understanding.

The final point can be seen as both a criticism and positive [[critique]]. Pearce and Cronen are constantly building upon the CMM theory which was originally outlined in the 1970s. By constant corrections and revisions, the theorists are working toward improving the examination of communication interactions; however, with each new update, minor course corrections alter the terms and meanings which increase the complexity of the overall theory.

CMM has guided research in an array of context and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004"&gt;Barge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Further discussion of CMM concepts and applications for research can be found at the following location: [http://www.pearceassociates.com/essays/research_menu.htm CMM Research]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">'''Cultural contracts''' refer to the degree that cultural values are exchanged between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67.&lt;/ref&gt; It extends [[identity negotiation]] theory and [[uncertainty reduction theory]] by focusing defining the negotiation experience from the perspective of minority groups when dealing with majority cultural norms. Cultural contracts theory was developed in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (1999). The Negotiation of Cultural Identity. Westport, CT: Praeger Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Ronald L. Jackson, an identity scholar and a professor in media and cinema studies at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

== Background ==
Cultural contracts first appeared in Communication Quarterly in 1999. The theory is inspired by Ting-Toomey's (1986) identity validation model (IDM) that emerged from a study of European American and African American communication experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, S. (1986). Conflict communication styles in black and white subjective cultures. International and Intercultural Communication Annual, 10, 75-88 here&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories are rooted in the exchanges between strangers as described in Berger and Calabrese's (1975) uncertainty reduction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, C. R., Calabrese, R. J. (1975). Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication. Human Communication Research, 1, 99–112&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural contracts focuses specifically on the exchanges between traditionally marginalized groups and majority groups in power in American society from the standpoint of the minority member. The theory is not limited to oral communication. Any value that makes up an individual's [[worldview]], including behavior and other cultural norms, can be negotiated and subjected to a cultural contract.

Cultural contracts suggests that [[mainstream]] and [[marginalized]] identities are in natural conflict. In order to achieve [[communication]], individuals must decide how much of their values will be negotiated. This results in one of three contracts by the minority identity: ready-to-sign contracts (assimilating to mainstream values); quasi-completed contracts (adapting marginalized values to accommodate mainstream values); and co-completed contracts (validating both mainstream and marginalized values).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson. R. L. (2004). Cultural contracts theory: Toward a critical rhetorical identity. In New approaches to rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals are not aware that they create or sign cultural contracts.

Each contract is a “result of how identities have been personally and socially constructed and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. &amp; Crawley, R. (2003).  White Student Confessions about an African American male professor: A Cultural Contracts Theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview.  Journal of Men's Studies, 12(1), 25-42&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is a [[ready-to-sign contract]], or assimilation, which occurs when individuals replace their culture identity for the dominant culture. This contract can be temporary or long-term and benefits the majority. There is no room for negotiating marginalized identity with [[mainstream]] ideals in this contract with no perceived benefit to the marginalized group.[[Quasi-completed contracts]] (adaptation) result in temporarily incorporating a small part of an individual's value to the mainstream value, and vice versa. This is usually a short-term contract since neither identity is dominant in this interaction. Lastly, [[co-completed contracts]] (mutual validation) result in blending values together. Cultural differences are acknowledged and valued in this contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, M. L., Jackson, R. L., &amp; Ribeau, S. A. (2003). African American communication: Exploring ethnic identity and culture, p. 248. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain instance, values are deeply penetrated and are not up for exchange. Others are more surface and the perceived benefits of the contract do not conflict with our core identity. This will determine if an individual is willing to sign a cultural contract or remain in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts are not unique and can either be short-term or long-term. This depends on the level of confidence a person has in her worldview. Although negotiation of cultural differences is expected, mutual validation is not always the goal or intent of human interaction. Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts can be signed one or two ways: the signee perceives a benefit in accommodating or assimilating, or the signee is forced to accommodate or assimilate.

Applications. In addition to identity research, cultural contracts theory has been used in higher education scholarship to explore the relationships between [[White people|White]] students and [[African America]]n faculty&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L., &amp; Crawley, R. L. (2003). White student confessions about a Black male professor: A cultural contracts theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview. The Journal of Men’s Studies, 12, 25-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, T. M. (2007). Black feminist thought and cultural contracts: Understanding the intersection and negotiation of racial, gendered, and professional identities in the academy. New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 110, 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2003, April). “Intercultural relationships work best when both sides treat each other as equals.” Science Blog. &lt;http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/G/20035017.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has also been used to explore the cultural contracts African American women sign in their beauty and hair choices.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson-Moore, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">A '''cultural footprint''' is the impact that a group or individual has on the cultural environment.

== Definition ==
“Cultural footprint”&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used in work launched by the association Diversum (“Mesurer et améliorer son empreinte culturelle : nouvelle thématique du développement durable” [“Measuring and Improving One’s Cultural Footprint: The New Topic in Sustainable Development”], Jérôme Gouadain’s contribution to the [https://www.observatoireplurilinguisme.eu/fr/les-actions/assises-berlin-juin-2009-fr-fr-6-1/88888966--sp-161/2207-programme-et-contributions 2nd European Conference on Plurilingualism], Berlin, 19 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was defined in June 2013, at the initiative of a group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society.

They explained it as “all of the externalities, both positive and negative, generated in the cultural environment by agents’ actions”. It is considered to be positive when it enriches [[cultural diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt; or fosters cultural intensity.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;[http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 24 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reference document published in 2017 specified that “all actors have the possibility of activating (i.e. exploring and utilizing) available cultural resources. At the same time, it is their responsibility to make a positive contribution” to that sub-stratum, to that creative atmosphere. This means that groups and individuals must “set requirements for themselves, engage based on their own singularities, and be culturally involved and invested”.

== Applications ==
“The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; is a document to which Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé and Nicole Rouvet contributed. It suggests several aspects of the cultural environment where economics might be able to make a contribution: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

'''Cultural identity''' is the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and [[self-perception]] and is related to [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], [[generation]], [[locality (settlement)|locality]] or any kind of social group that has its own distinct [[culture]]. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the [[individual]] but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Moha Ennaji, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXsF7fT318QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22cultural%20identity%22&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco]'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2005, pp.19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Child With Flag.jpg|thumb|Child with flag and a gun]]
Various modern [[cultural studies]] and [[social theories]] have investigated cultural identity and understanding . In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged which breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: [[Location (geography)|location]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[history]], [[nationality]], [[language]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious beliefs]], [[ethnicity]], [[aesthetics]], and even [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing Taste: TheWalrus.ca&lt;/ref&gt; As one author writes, recognizing both coherence and fragmentation:

{{cquote|categorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url=https://www.academia.edu/11768378 | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195 | doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.993332}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.

As a "historical reservoir," culture is an important factor in shaping identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicola |last=Pratt |title=Identity, Culture and Democratization: The Case of Egypt |journal=New Political Science |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=69–86 |doi=10.1080/07393140500030832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its "historical reservoir," many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society, and that [[cosmopolitanism]] gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_A6qIkbYB_kC ''The Limits of Nationalism''] by Chaim Gans. {{ISBN|978-0-521-00467-1}} {{ISBN|0521004675}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their 'make up' that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other.&lt;ref&gt;C Brown (2001) ''Understanding International Relations''. Hampshire, Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; Nations provide the framework for culture identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence N TiceTHE EDUCATION DIGEST, V. 64 (9), 05/1999, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of interest is the interplay between cultural identity and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = C. L. | year = 2010 | title = New media and cultural identity | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+media+and+cultural+identity.-a0219656567 | journal = China Media Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than necessarily representing an individual's interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the [[agenda setting|social norms as presented by the media]]. Accordingly, instead of learning [[behaviour]] and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insanbilimleri.com/ojs/index.php/uib/article/view/406|title=Media and cultural identity - Mora - International Journal of Human Sciences|website=insanbilimleri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of cultural complexities structure the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. [[Nation]] is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for individual's identity but it may contrast with ones cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones [[religion]], ancestry, skin colour, language, [[Class (social)|class]], education, profession, skill, family and political [[Propositional attitude|attitudes]]. These factors contribute to the development of one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Adrian|title=Complexity in cultural identity|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|date=May 2010|volume=10|issue=2|page=177|doi=10.1080/14708470903267384-2196217058202341170.pdf|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural identity is essentially how we as individuals cater to all positions of our lives. We may be teachers, students, friends, bosses, employees, etc. How we act and how our schemas contribute to our positions are the building blocks of your overall cultural identity.

It is also noted that an individual's "[[Social environment|cultural arena]]", or place where one lives, impacts the culture that that person chooses to abide by. The surroundings, the environment, the people in these places play a factor in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to [[Acculturation|fit into the culture]] of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant's current [[World view|belief in their culture]] and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.

Some might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by [[Biculturalism|committing to two or more cultures]]. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The nature of the impact of cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real world cultural arena. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holliday | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity in cultural identity | url = | journal = Language and Intercultural Communication | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 165–177 | doi = 10.1080/14708470903267384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Language develops from the wants of the people who tend to disperse themselves in a common given location over a particular period of time. This tends to allow people to share a way of life that generally links individuals in a certain culture that is identified by the people of that group. The affluence of communication that comes along with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Language can function as a fluid and ever changing identifier, and can be developed in response or rebellion of another cultural code, such as creole languages in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Stuart|last2=Ghazoul|first2=Ferial|date=2012-01-01|title=Cultural identity and diaspora|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA302403835&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=fulltext&amp;issn=11108673&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1&amp;isAnonymousEntry=true|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|language=English|issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Language also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language.

Language learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a [[Multilingualism|second language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Bok-Myung|title=Cultural Identity in Korean English|journal=Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics|year=2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=131–145|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ920507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many aspects of a person's cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures can change cultural traditions, language is a main component of cultural identity.

==Education==
Kevin McDonough pointed out, in his article, several factors concerning support or rejection of the government for different cultural identity education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDonough | first1 = Kevin | year = 1998 | title = Can the Liberal State Support Cultural Identity Schools? | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 463–499 | doi=10.1086/444195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have also shown concern for the state support regarding equity for children, school transitions and multicultural education. During March 1998, the two authors, Linda D. Labbo and Sherry L. Field collected several useful books and resources to promote multicultural education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tice, Terrence N. [http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cultural+identity&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Education+Digest&amp;rft.au=Terrence+N+Tice&amp;rft.date=1999-05-31&amp;rft.issn=0013-127X&amp;rft.eissn=1949-0275&amp;rft.volume=64&amp;rft.issue=9&amp;rft.spage=43&amp;rft.externalDBID=GTED&amp;rft.externalDocID=40876855 "Cultural Identity"], ''The Education Digest'', May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigrant identity development ==
Identity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of [[acculturation]].  Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a [[qualitative study]] through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish Refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity.  The results indicated that, “…[[acculturation]] appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing.  However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country” (Birman &amp; Trickett, 2001).

In a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society in order to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, having a combination of having a strong ethnic and national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence.  An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural.  It is shown that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one’s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990).  Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, classes, after–school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures.  It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants’ identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the study cited, a combination of family workshops and teacher professional development aimed to improve the language learning and emotional development of these youths and families &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==School transitions==
How great is "Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School"? John W. Alspaugh's research is in the September/October 1998 ''Journal of Educational Research'' (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.&lt;ref name="Copyright Prakken Publications, Inc. May 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrence N|first=Tice|title=Cultural Identity|year=1999|publisher=Prakken Publications, Inc.|pages=43–44|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218180019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.

Unexamined cultural identity: "a stage where one's cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues." This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn't distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.

An example of thought in this stage: "I don't have a culture I'm just an American." "My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I've never lived there."

Cultural identity search: "is the process of exploration and questioning about one's culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture." During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.

An example of thought in this stage: "I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others." "There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am."

Cultural identity achievement: "is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one's cultural identity." In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination, and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment

== The role of the internet ==
There is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between [[Cyberculture|virtual culture]] – understood as the modes and norms of behaviour associated with the [[internet]] and the [[online world]] – and [[youth culture]]. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and [[Reality|real]] sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a [[Moebius Strip|Moebius strip]] where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of [[active learning]], of [[googling]] 'when you don’t know', of recourse to tutorials for 'learning' a programme or a game, or the expression 'I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing' are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Políticas TIC en los Sistemas Educativos de América Latina. Informe sobre tendencias sociales y educativas en América Latina|last=SITEAL, IIPE-UNESCO y OEI|first=|publisher=Buenos Aires, IIEP-UNESCO Regional Office in Buenos Aires.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today's youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependency for peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of [[Identity formation|identity construction]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Youth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the ‘real’ world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Los adolescentes y las redes sociales|last=Morduchowicz|first=R.|last2=Marcon|first2=A.|last3=Sylvestre|first3=A.|last4=Ballestrini|first4=F.|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

From other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of ‘identity laboratory’ and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet|last=Turkle|first=S.|publisher=New York, Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of the Internet|last=Wallace|first=P.|publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. [[video game]]s or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zegers|first=B.|last2=Larraín|first2=M.E.|year=2011|title=El impacto de la Internet en la definición de la identidad juvenil: una revisión|url=http://www.psykhe.cl/index.php/psykhe/article/view/469/448|journal=Psykhe|volume= 11| issue =  1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The '''culture of capitalism''' or '''capitalist culture''' is the set of social practices, social norms, values and patterns of behavior that are attributed to the capitalist economic system in a capitalist society. Capitalist culture promotes the [[accumulation of capital]] and the sale of commodities, where individuals are primarily defined by their relationship to business and the market. The culture is composed of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act in order to survive in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= The culture of capitalism is devoted to encouraging the production and sale of commodities. For capitalists, the culture encourages the accumulation of profit; for laborers, it encourages the accumulation of wages; for consumers, it encourages the accumulation of goods. In other words, capitalism defines sets of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of capitalist culture include the mindset of [[business]] and corporate culture, [[consumerism]] and working class culture.

==Capitalist culture and ideology==
While certain political ideologies, such as [[neoliberalism]], assume and promote the view that the behavior that capitalism fosters in individuals is natural to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/human-nature-politics-left-right |title=Who's correct about human nature, the left or the right? |author=Ed Rooksby |date=2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/261927/two-cheers-capitalism-bruce-thornton |title=Two sheers for capitalism |author=Bruce Thornton |date=2016 |publisher=Frontpage Magazine |accessdate=24 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologists like [[Richard Robbins (anthropologist)|Richard Robbins]] point out that there is nothing natural about this behavior - people are not naturally dispossessed to accumulate wealth and driven by wage-labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= There is nothing natural about this behavior. People are not naturally driven to accumulate wealth. There are societies in which such accumulation is discouraged...People are not driven to work; in fact, contrary to popular notions, members of capitalist culture work far more than, say, people who live by gathering and hunting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ideologies such as neoliberalism abstract the economic sphere from other aspects of society (politics, culture, family etc., with any political activity constituting an [[Economic interventionism|intervention]] into the natural process of the market, for example) and assume that people make rational exchanges in the sphere of market transactions. However, applying the concept of embeddedness to market societies, the sociologist Granovetter demonstrates that rational economic exchanges are actually heavily influenced by pre-existing social ties and other factors.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a capitalist system, society and culture revolve around business activity (the accumulation of capital). As such, business activity and the market exchange are often viewed as being absolute or "natural" in that all other human social relations revolve around these processes (or should exist to facilitate one's ability to perform these processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/market_mystification.php |title=Market Mystification in Capitalist and Market Socialist Societies |author=[[Bertell Ollman]] |date= |publisher=[[New York University]] |accessdate=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Richard|title=Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

'''Dream sharing''' is the process of  documenting or discussing both night and day dreams with others. One of the primary purposes of sharing dreams is [[dream interpretation]].

The sharing of dreams dates back at least as far as 4000-3000 BC in permanent form on clay tablets. In ancient Egypt, dreams were among the items recorded in the form of hieroglyphics. In ancient Egyptian culture dream sharing had a religious context as priests doubled as dream interpreters.

Those whose dreams were especially vivid or significant were thought to be blessed and were given special status in these ancient societies.  Likewise, people who were able to interpret dreams were thought to receive these gifts directly from the gods, and they enjoyed a special status in society as well.

The respect for dreams changed radically early in the 19th century, and dreams in that era were often dismissed as reactions to anxiety, outside noises or even bad food and indigestion. During this period of time, dreams were thought to have no meaning at all, and interest in dream interpretation all but evaporated. This all changed, however, with the arrival of [[Sigmund Freud]] later in the 19th century. Freud stunned the world of psychiatry by stressing the importance of dreams, and he revived the once dead art of dream interpretation.

'''Ear stapling''' is a form of [[acupuncture]] that involves inserting a thin staple through a portion of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]]&amp;mdash;the visible part of the ear.  Ear stapling has been suggested as an [[Alternative medicine|alternative]] weight-loss treatment, and there is recent evidence to support its efficacy but none from reputable scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S.

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the

== Identity politics ==

=== Asian concepts ===
{{cleanup|reason=The first paragraph in this section uses English words, but does not manage to make coherent English sentences. The second paragraph is mostly one run-on sentence.|date=April 2018}}
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An image of the "Eastern world" defined as [[Asia]]]]
Although the concept of a united Asian people and not mean [[Asian people|Asian race]] is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like [[Western Asia]] that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of Western Asia, [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] — the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] — the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] — a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] — the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.

'''Extant literature''' and '''extant music''' refers to texts or music that has survived from the past to the present time, as opposed to [[lost work]]. Extant literature can be divided into extant original [[manuscript]]s, copies of original manuscripts, quotations and paraphrases of passages of non-extant texts contained in other works, translations of non-extant texts into other languages, or, more recently, photocopies or digital copies of texts.

{{About||fandom generally|Fandom|animal fancier clubs|Animal fancy}}
{{One source|date=January 2016}}

A '''fan club''' is a group that is dedicated to celebrities group, or idea (such as an inanimate object, such as a famous building). Most fan clubs are run by [[Fan (person)|fans]] who devote considerable time and resources to supporting them. There are also "official" fan clubs that are run by someone associated with the person or organization the club is centered on. This is the case for many [[musician]]s, [[sport]]s teams, etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a Fan Club? (with pictures)|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-fan-club.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in a fan club usually have either a T-shirt or a pin to indicate which fan club they are a part of. All fan clubs have unique paraphernalia that are given or sold to fans to use as an indication. Hollanders, who support [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], are an example of a fan club.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the
term fan in reference to a dedicated zealot is unclear. The word may have
emerged in the 1800s when boxing supporters were said to take a “fancy” to pugilistic
sports. Amongst modern sports fans, however, the title is considered a
shortened version of the word fanatic, as in “baseball fanatic,” an indication
of the dedication of fan club members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Functions==
Larger fan clubs may organize events and [[fundraising]] relating to what they are based on. In some cases the money that is raised goes directly to fan club members or to fund the club itself.

There are two main kinds of fan clubs, there are fan clubs that do not require an official registration process and others that do. Fan clubs that do require a formal registration usually require a membership fee. Different fan clubs have different systems, however most clubs have an annual membership fee. These fees will be used to run the foundation. If the fan clubs are for certain fashion brands they may use those fees for advertisement.

== Groupies vs Fan Clubs ==
The term '''[[groupie]]''' is a slang that is commonly used in reference to fans of a particular musician, band, or celebrity who follow the group- or individual- while they are touring, or who attend as many of their public appearances as possible. The word is often used to describe female fans seeking sexual relationships with musicians. They often value musicians themselves over their music.

Groupies are more personally affiliated with the band or celebrity they follow, however fans are not affiliated as they are more reserved than groupies would be. Most fan clubs are online and fans who are a part of these clubs, do not usually get to have personal connections with whom they are fans of. 

==Internet==
{{Main|Fansite}}
Today, many fan clubs have [[web site]]s to support their efforts. These sites usually have photos and information on the object of their affection. For example, a fan site dedicated to [[musician]]s might have photos, videos, [[Bulletin board system|discussion boards]], and information on upcoming [[concert]]s.

Fan clubs are growing in number thanks to technological advances and influences on social media.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] activism and feminist authorship stemming from [[second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]] in the 1960s and 70s began to draw attention to [[gender bias]] in [[language]], including "the uncovering of the gendered nature of many linguistic rules and norms".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Linguistic Sexism and Feminist Linguistic Activism|last = Pauwels|first = Anne|date = 2003|journal = The Handbook and Language of Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship such as [[Dennis Baron|Dennis Baron's]] "Grammar and Gender" and Anne Bodine's "Androcentrism in Prescriptive Grammar" uncovered historical [[male]] regulation to promote [[Patriarchy|male-centric]] language such as the use of "[[he]]" as a generic pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammar and Gender|last = Baron|first = Dennis|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = New Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Androcentrism in prescriptive [[grammar]]: singular ‘they’, sex-indefinite ‘he’, and ‘he or she’|last = Bodine|first = Anne|date = 1975|journal = Language in Society|doi = 10.1017/s0047404500004607|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposition and analysis of [[sexism]] in language through a [[grassroots]] feminist linguistics movement continued throughout the 80's and 90's, including study across languages and [[Speech community|speech communities]] such as Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender and Language in Germany|last = Leue|first = Elisabeth|date = 2000|journal = Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The [[battle]] of [[feminism]] and bon usage: instituting nonsexist usage in French|last = Fleischman|first = S.|date = 1997|journal = French Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study and documentation of gendered language has since spread to cover over 30 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender across languages The linguistic representation of women and men|last = Hellinger|first = M.|publisher = John Benjamin's Publishing Company|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages = Preface|last2 = Bußmann|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist language planning has more recently been instituted centrally in countries such as [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]], with mixed results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sweden have made strides towards shifting their language to fit a less misogynistic society. In the Swedish language, there has never been a word for the female genitalia or even a translation of the word “vagina”, even though the word ''snopp'' translates to “penis” and has been used as such since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through history, there have been many slang terms used for the woman’s genitalia, including words such as ''fitta'' translated to “cunt”, ''där nere'' translated to “down-there”, and even ''mus'' translated to “mouse”. In the 1990s, Swedish media started to bring the absence of such a word to light. It wasn’t until the early 2000s did the feminists and activists start using the word ''snippa'' to be identified with the female genitalia. ''Snippa''’s origins can be traced back to many different Swedish dialects. It’s popular definition “refers to something small and/or narrow, for example a small pike or a narrow boat”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In regards to genitalia, “it might have been used to refer to female genitalia of cows and pigs in the early twentieth century”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the popularization of using the word ''Snippa,'' the Swedish Academy added the word to the 2006 Swedish Language Dictionary.

Some language reformers directly work with identifying and changing sexist undertones and patriarchal vocabulary through a method called “linguistic disruption”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example: In the United States, the word “herstory” became popularized “to refer to history which is not only about men”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sweden has also showed efforts in language planning regarding changing misogynistic undertones in their vocabulary. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education has promoted the word ''slidkrans'' to replace the word for “hymen”, ''mödomshinna.'' “The new word, ''slidkrans'', is made up of the two parts ''slid'', translating to “vaginal” and ''krans'', translating to “garland”. It lacks the connotations of the ideology of virginity and honour attached to mödomshinna.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, Sweden has also shown efforts in accepting more of a non-gender binary identity by creating the gender-neutral pronoun ''hen,'' which has been used by feminists and the LGBT community. Feminist language reform regarding gender is not of recent efforts. Early feminist language reformists have been fighting the male-dominant approach to language and raising awareness to the public about the gendered structure of the society’s language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An interdisciplinary bibliography on language, gender, and sexuality|last=Motschenbacher|first=Heiko|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9789027273154|location=|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has been identified as a nation that officially promotes the feminist influence to its public bureaucracy by implementing feminist language reform across many institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Jo|date=December 23, 2010|title='Trajectories of Agency' and Discursive Identities in Education: A Critical Site in Feminist Language Planning|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.2167/cilp093.0#tabModule|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=|pages=171–198|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this planned social shift, Australia has seen changes in political and government leadership that aim to interfere with this reform, such as a shift towards a conservative-leaning government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are shifts that come from such movements that support them as well, such as the gender-neutral pronoun “they” being more widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The ongoing feminist movement acknowledges language as a “powerful instrument of patriarchy”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Anne|date=1999-11-14|title=Feminist Language Planning: Has it been worthwhile?|url=https://bop.unibe.ch/linguistik-online/article/view/1043|journal=Linguistik Online|language=de-DE|volume=2|issue=1|issn=1615-3014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals set for linguistic reform aim to achieve linguistic equality of the sexes. A study of Australian newspapers from 1992 and 1996 found that the word “chairman” was used to describe all people holding the position, including women.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This is an example of a linguistic issue that feminist’s seek to reform. Occupational nomenclature reflects gender bias when “professional nomenclature used in employment-related contexts displays bias in favour of men leading to women’s invisibility in this area.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; The invisibility of women is a linguistic feminist issue because when encountering sentences predominantly using male pronouns, listeners are more likely to think of men before women and therefore women get overlooked.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Positions are gendered to be male and the “continuing, frequent use reflects the fact that far more men than women continue to occupy this position.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This study further investigated and found instances of female professionals being specified as women while men would just be titled with the profession itself, for example “female judge,” “woman engineer,” and “woman politician.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland has attempted to implement feminist language reform both formally and informally. However, changes in Switzerland have proven to be complicated due to the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country (with the major languages being German, French, and Italian). The Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée (Swiss Bulletin of Applied Linguistics) addressed this issue in 2000 when it created a special issue dedicated to the feminization of language in Switzerland. The bulletin attempted to critique language in Switzerland by creating a composite image of all the languages in Switzerland and how they interact with gender.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucchi-Faina|first=Angelica|date=March 1, 2005|title=Visible or influential? Language reforms and gender (in)equality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0539018405050466|journal=Social Science Information|volume=44|pages=10|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is German. German is a gendered language. This has concerned some language activists due to the fact that many important societal position such as judge and professor possess the gender of male and are often referred to as he/him. Activists worry that the gendering of those words discourage women from entering those fields. This facet of the German language is particularly important in Switzerland because it was historically used as a justification to restrict women’s right to vote and pass the bar.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zzW5dqN8NiUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=switzerland+feminist+language+reform&amp;ots=fyNietMHbk&amp;sig=JVv4_W11OgUfYCSM5trQ16-Ky5g#v=onepage&amp;q=switzerland&amp;f=false|title=Social Communication|last=Fiedler|first=Klaus|date=2011-03-15|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781136872426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts to implement feminist language reform have been undertaken in German speaking Switzerland. The government and other organizations have attempted to implement language feminization in the realms of policy making, teaching, advertising, etc.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Language feminization refers to when in writing or talking traditional male words are feminized by either using the feminine variant of the word or adding a feminine suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mINlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2635&amp;lpg=PA2635&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p4RDWcmlbX&amp;sig=Q4QgBWuZOuhR6JYYfRCgYWhJKRw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_t6AiPPPAhXCLMAKHYZrCoUQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22&amp;f=false|title=Word-Formation: An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe|date=2016-01-15|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110379082|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts have had only limited success. For example, private Swiss radio and television broadcasts still generally use the generic-masculine form of words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is French which is also a gendered language. The French language raises similar concerns to that of the German language. This is because many nouns (especially those of professions) are gendered. To address these concerns, the Swiss government has created a guide on the non-sexist use of the French language. However, these attempts at change have been met with little success. This is due to the fact that Switzerland has limited influence over the French language. Meanwhile, France and specifically the government backed Académie Française (French Academy) (the French council for matters relating to the French language) has resisted feminist language reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischman|first=Suzanne|date=1997|title=The Battle of Feminism and Bon Usage: Instituting Nonsexist Usage in French|jstor=398544|journal=The French Review|volume=70|issue=6|pages=834–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The main focus of Feminist Language Reform is to acknowledge the often unconscious ways that language both silences and emphasizes gender in negative ways. In some languages it is clear with gendered nouns how some words are gendered to associate those words with maleness of femaleness. [[Feminist philosophy|Feminist Philosophers]] argue that English, a non gendered language, still has the need for Language Reform.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/feminism-language/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|last2=Diaz-Leon|first2=Esa|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous [[language reform]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; attempts to avoid [[Sexism|sexist]] words or phrases were addressed in a [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] manner. Often in the workplace, employees were given pamphlets with lists of words to avoid or preferred words to use. Many [[Fourth-wave feminism|modern day feminists]] argue that this is ineffective because it does not address the root of the problem or make the large scale changes to the language that they feel are necessary.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=553f6fea-4b9e-4fff-af20-4d1bbc51bb3c@sessionmgr102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsgcl.16476233&amp;db=edsglr|title=Nonsexist language reform and 'political correctness.': Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of the theory focuses on when words or phrases make one gender, typically women, subjugated or invisible compared to the other. The most popular examples are the pronoun “he” or the word “man”. Feminist Language Philosophers argue that these words participate in making women invisible by having them being used to refer to men and also women. The fact that the pronouns or words for the male [[gender]] can be also used to refer to the female [[gender]] shows how maleness is dominant and femaleness is subjugated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist Language Theory also focuses on when words or phrases emphasize a break in [[Gender role|gender norms]]. Clear examples of this are words like Lady Doctor or Manageress. These are positions of power that are typically held by men. Therefore, when a woman holds them, they need a new title to emphasize their break of social norm.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also goes both ways, with terms like male nurse referring to a man in a typically feminine role. Feminist Language Reform seeks to remove words like this because they help to sustain unhealthy gender norms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Some modern [[Feminism|feminists]], like Sergio Bolaños Cuellar, argue that feminist language reforms needs to reverse the generic masculine forms and create a generic feminine form with words like he or man being replaced with she or woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolaños Cuéllar|first=Sergio|date=2006-06-01|title=Women's language: a struggle to overcome inequality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238766777_Women's_language_a_struggle_to_overcome_inequality|journal=Forma y Función}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Cases of feminist language [[plan]]ning have taken a largely [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] approach in which the goal is to enact [[social change]] through the reform of language and language use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This approach to [[language planning]] is divided into four stages:

# '''Fact-finding''' in which language [[:wikt:issue|issues]] are identified and [[report]]ed.
# '''Planning''' in which [[solution]]s to the issue are proposed.
# '''Implementation''' in which agreed upon methods are [[test (assessment)|tested]] and the final solution implemented.
# '''Evaluation and Feedback''' in which the results of the [[plan]] are assessed for effectiveness and the overall affects of the plan are evaluated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Living with Patriarchy : Discursive Constructions of Gendered Subjects across Cultures|last = Majstorovic|first = Danijela|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company|year = 2011|isbn = 9789027206367|location = |pages = 74|last2 = Lassen|first2 = Inger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Folklore and Ethnography Collection''' ({{lang-bg|Сборник за народни умотворения и народопис}}, ''Sbornik za narodni umotvoreniia i narodopis'') is 
a serial publication covering various aspects of Bulgarian folklore and cultural anthropology. It has been published in [[Sofia]] since 1889; Volume 63 appeared in 2007, and Volume 64 appeared in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nauka.bg/a/%D1%81%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81-%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0-64 |title=Сборник за народни умотворения и народопис.

The title of this serial is commonly abbreviated as SbNU (СбНУ). It is fairly difficult to translate precisely, as the words "народни умотворения" literally means "creations of the folk mind". The title has been translated into English in various ways, including ''Collection of folklore and folk studies'',  ''Collection of works of the popular spirit'', etc.

This is a publication in which a great amount of Bulgarian (including from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bessarabia]] etc.) folk songs, tales, etc. have been first published.

==Not to confuse with==
The Folklore and Ethnography Collection should be distinguished from another publication with a fairly similar name, the  ''Bulgarian Folklore Collection''({{lang-bg|Сборник от български народни умотворения}}, ''Sbornik ot bâlgarski narodni umotvoreniia''). Edited by [[Kuzman Shapkarev]], that collection, in several volumes, appeared in 1891.

In 2006, Niedzviecki hosted a summer replacement series, ''Subcultures'', on [[CBC Radio One]].

In 2017, Niedzviecki wrote a piece for ''Write'', the Writers' Union of Canada magazine, where he wrote: "In my opinion, anyone, anywhere, should be encouraged to imagine other peoples, other cultures, other identities" and told writers to try to "Win the Appropriation Prize". After controversy arose over the piece he resigned from the editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dundas|first1=Deborah|title=Editor quits amid outrage after call for ‘Appropriation Prize’ in writers' magazine|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2017/05/10/editor-quits-amid-outrage-after-call-for-appropriation-prize-in-writers-magazine.html|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5511">'''Anorexia athletica''' ('''sports anorexia'''), also referred to as '''hypergymnasia''', is an [[eating disorder]] characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise. An athlete suffering from sports anorexia tends to over exercise to give themselves a sense of having control over their body. Most often, people with the disorder tend to feel they have no control over their lives other than their control of food and exercise. In actuality, they have no control; they cannot stop exercising or regulating food intake without feeling guilty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Eating Disorder Information Centre|url=http://www.nedic.ca/knowthefacts/definitions.shtml|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, once the activity is started, it is difficult to stop because the person is seen as being addicted to the method adopted. 

Anorexia athletica is used to refer to "a disorder for athletes who engage in at least one unhealthy method of weight control".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/content/article/83/97765.htm "Activity Disorder: Too Much Little Of A Good Thing"] from WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[anorexia nervosa]], anorexia athletica does not have as much to do with body image as it does with performance. Athletes usually begin by eating more 'healthy' foods, as well as increasing their training, but when people feel like that is not enough and start working out excessively and cutting back their caloric intake until it becomes a [[psychological disorder]].
 
Hypergymnasia and anorexia athletica are not recognized as [[mental disorders]] in any of the medical manuals, such as the [[ICD-10]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm|title=ICD 10|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[DSM-IV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm|title=APA Diagnostic Classification DSM-IV-TR - BehaveNet|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026155340/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm|archivedate=2011-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is it part of the proposed revision of this manual, the [[DSM-5]]. If this were the case, there would be a 10–15% increase in mental disorders in sports.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Disorder Research in Sweden|url=http://www.gborienteering.org.uk/images/uploaded/downloads/international_squadtrainingbook7_sportsanorexia.pdf|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study at the Anorexia Centre at Huddinge Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden showed that sports anorexia can result in mental disorders. The anxiety, stress, and pressure people with sports anorexia put on themselves (as well as the pressure parents and coaches can put on the athlete) can cause mental disorders.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Someone with anorexia athletica can experience numerous signs and symptoms, a few of which are listed below. The seriousness of the symptoms is dependent on the individual, and more symptoms come with the length the athlete excessively exercises. If anorexia athletica persists for long enough, the individual can become [[malnourished]], which eventually leads to further complications in major organs such as the liver, kidney, heart and brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mayo-clinic research|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/anorexia/DS00606/DSECTION=complications|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Excessive exercise 
* Obsessive behavior with [[calories]], fat, and weight 
* Self-worth is based on physical performance 
* Enjoyment of sports is diminished or gone
* Denying the over exercising is a problem

==Causes==
There is not one single cause of anorexia athletica, but many factors that are involved in the disorder. Research has shown that an area on chromosome 1 is linked to anorexia nervosa-sports anorexia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Thus, a person is more likely to have anorexia athletica if someone in their immediate family has had the disorder. Not only genetics, but also the environment a person is in, has a major impact on the disorder. Coaches and parents often suggest to their athlete/child to lose weight in order to perform better. Sports such as figure skating, ballet, and gymnastics promote both male and female athletes to have a thin figure. Females who partake in sports can suffer from a syndrome known as the [[Female athlete triad|triad]].  The media play a very significant role in pressuring athletes to have the ‘perfect’ body and to be thin, which can also trigger sports anorexia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Treatment==
According to the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC), the first step for someone going through anorexia athletica is to realize their eating and exercise habits are hurting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Eating Disorder Information Centre|url=http://www.nedic.ca/knowthefacts/treatmentcare.shtml|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an individual has realized they have a disorder, an appointment should be made with the family doctor. A family doctor can advise further medical attention if needed. With sports anorexia, it is important to go to a dietitian as well as a personal trainer. People with sports anorexia need to learn the balance between exercise and caloric intake.

[[File:US Debt Trend.svg|thumb|The U.S. National Debt is often cited as an example of intergenerational inequity, as future generations will have the responsibility of paying it off. The U.S. National Debt has grown substantially over the past several decades. Relative to total GDP, the debt burden has worsened in the past several years.]]
'''Intergenerational equity''' in economic, psychological, and sociological contexts, is the concept or idea of fairness or [[justice]] between generations. The concept can be applied to fairness in dynamics between [[children]], [[youth]], [[adults]] and [[Old age|seniors]], in terms of treatment and interactions. It can also be applied to fairness between generations currently living and generations yet to be born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Read: Generation wars|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15456374.The_Big_Read__Generation_wars/|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversations about intergenerational equity occur across several fields.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.globalepe.org/values_ie.html EPE Values: Intergenerational Ethics] Earth and Peace Education Associates International website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often discussed in public economics, especially with regard to [[transition economics]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/pie/Japanese/seminar/A6-workshop0503/index.html "Economics of Intergenerational Equity in Transition Economies"] 10–11 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social policy]], and [[Government budget|government budget-making]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. (2003) [http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/2002-03/03RP07.htm Research Paper no. 7 2002-03 Intergenerational Equity: Issues of Principle in the Allocation of Social Resources Between this Generation and the Next]. Social Policy Group for the Parliament of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Many cite the growing U.S. national debt as an example of intergenerational inequity, as future generations will shoulder the consequences. Intergenerational equity is also explored in [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index165.html Gosseries, A. (2008) "Theories of intergenerational justice: a synopsis". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.fathom.com/course/21701763/session3.html Understanding Sustainable Development] Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[global warming]] and [[climate change]]. The continued depletion of natural resources that has occurred in the past century will likely be a significant burden for future generations. Intergenerational equity is also discussed with regard to [[Standard of living|standards of living]], with the focus falling on inequities in the living standards experienced by people of different ages and generations.&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadji"&gt;d'Albis, Hippolyte and Ikpidi Badji (2017) [http://www.ntaccounts.org/doc/repository/Albis_Badji_2017.pdf "Intergenerational Inequalities in Standards of Living in France"], ''Economie et Statistique / Economics and Statistics'', 491-492: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadjiElMekkaouiNavaux"&gt;d'Albis, Hippolyte, Ikpidi Badji, Najat El Mekkaoui and Julien Navaux (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeoa.2017.11.002 "Private Asset Income in France: Is There a Breakdown of Intergenerational Equity between 1979 and 2011?"], ''Journal of the Economics of Ageing''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald"&gt;Rice, James M, Jeromey B Temple and Peter F McDonald (2017) [http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Consumption.pdf "Private and Public Consumption across Generations in Australia"], ''Australasian Journal on Ageing'', 36(4): 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Intergenerational equity issues also arise in the arenas of [[elderly care]] and [[social justice]].

== Public economics usage ==

=== History ===
Since the first recorded debt issuance in Sumaria in 1796 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/finciv/chapter1.htm|title=Financing Civilization|first=William|last=Goetzmann|date=|website=viking.som.yale.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the penalties for failure to repay a loan has been [[debt bondage]]. In some instances, this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtor's children, essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery. About one millennium after written debt contracts were created, the concept of [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]] appears in the Old Testament, called [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] ([[Leviticus]] 25), and in Greek law when Solon introduces [[Seisachtheia]].  Both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents' debt.

While [[slavery]] is illegal in all countries today, North Korea has a policy called, "Three Generations of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaechon internment camp]]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been documented by [[Shin Dong-hyuk]] and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents' mistakes. Stanley Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada have applied this concept (calling it "Generational Theft"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323485704578257753243530078|title=WSJ|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the large increase in government debt being left by the Baby Boomers to their children.

=== Investment management ===
In the context of institutional [[investment management]], intergenerational equity is the principle that an endowed institution's spending rate must not exceed its after-inflation rate of compound return, so that investment gains are spent equally on current and future constituents of the endowed assets. This concept was originally set out in 1974 by [[economist]] [[James Tobin]], who wrote that, "The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, James.  (1974) "[http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i2p427-32.html What is Permanent Endowment Income?]"&lt;/ref&gt;
in terms of an economical context. ''Intergenerational equity'' refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources. An example is the forest-dwelling civilians in Papua New Guinea, who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest which thus becomes their land. The adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money. If they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources, their next or future generations will lose this resource.

=== U.S. national debt ===
{{See also|National debt of the United States}}
One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:
*For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them, which by definition must correspond to the level of debt passed on.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/debt-is-mostly-money-we-owe-to-ourselves/|title=Debt Is (Mostly) Money We Owe to Ourselves|author=|date=28 December 2011|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html|title=Who Rules America: Wealth, Income, and Power|author=|date=|website=www2.ucsc.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today. 
*To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the "debt held by the public" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; 
*Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010). [http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11659 "Federal debt and the risk of a fiscal crisis"].  Congressional Budget Office:  Macroeconomic Analysis Division. Retrieved February 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via useful infrastructure projects, future generations may benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/david-brooks-is-projecting-his-self-indulgence-again|title=David Brooks Is Projecting His Self Indulgence Again|first=Dean|last=Baker|date=|website=cepr.net|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: "Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we’re doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/opinion/krugman-cheating-our-children.html|title=Opinion - Cheating Our Children|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=28 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian politician [[Christine Milne]] made similar statements in the lead up to the 2014 Carbon Price Repeal Bill, naming the Liberal National Party (elected to parliament in 2013) and inherently its ministers, as intergenerational thieves; her statement was based on the party's attempts to roll back progressive carbon tax policy and the impact this would have on the intergenerational equity of future generations.

=== U.S. Social Security ===
{{See also|Social Security (United States)}}The U.S. Social Security system has provided a greater net benefit to those who reached retirement closest to the first implementation of the system. The system is unfunded, meaning the elderly who retired right after the implementation of the system did not pay any taxes into the social security system, but reaped the benefits. Professor Michael Doran estimates that cohorts born previous to 1938 will receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, while the reverse is true to cohorts born after. Further, he admits that the long-term insolvency of Social Security will likely lead to be further unintentional intergenerational transfers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Michael Doran (2008). “Intergenerational Equity in Fiscal Policy Reform”. Tax law Rewiew. 61: 241-293&lt;/ref&gt; However, Broad concedes that other benefits have been introduced into U.S. society via the welfare system, like Medicare and government-financed medical research, that benefit current and future elderly cohorts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Environmental usage ==

Intergenerational equity is often referred to in environmental contexts, as younger age cohorts will disproportionately experience the negative consequences of environmental damage. Two perspectives can be taken on what should be done to ameliorate environmental intergenerational equity: the "[[Weak and strong sustainability|weak sustainability]]" perspective and the "strong sustainability" perspective. From the "weak" perspective, intergenerational equity would be achieved if losses to the environment that future generations face were offset by gains in economic progress. From the "strong" perspective, no amount of economic progress can justify leaving future generations with a degraded environment. According to Professor Sharon Beder, the "weak" perspective is undermined by a lack of knowledge of the future, as we do not know which intrinsically valuable resources will not be able to be replaced by technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sharon Beder, 'Costing the Earth: Equity, Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law, 4, 2000, pp. 227-243.&lt;/ref&gt; We also do not know to what extent environmental damage is irreversible. Further, more harm cannot be avoided to many species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars contest Beder's point of view. Professor Wilfred Beckerman insists that "strong sustainability" is "morally repugnant", particularly when it overrides other moral concerns about those alive today.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beckerman, Wilfred. "'Sustainable Development': Is it a Useful Concept?" Environmental Values 3, no. 3, (1994): 191–209. doi:10.3197/096327194776679700.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckerman insists that the optimal choice for society is to prioritize the welfare of current generations above future generations. He suggests placing a discount rate on outcomes for future generations when accounting for generational equity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Juliana vs. United States ===

In September 2015, a group of youth environmental activists filed to sue the U.S. federal government for insufficiently protecting against climate change. Their statement emphasized the disproportionate cost of climate-related damage younger generations would bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/23/can-citizens-sue-the-government-over-climate-change/citizens-have-a-right-to-sue-for-climate-change-action|title=Citizens Have a Right to Sue for Climate Change Action|last=Chemerinsky|first=Erwin|date=July 11, 2016|work=New York Times|access-date=April 28, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated “Youth Plaintiffs represent the youngest living generation, beneficiaries of the public trust. Youth Plaintiffs have a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in protecting the atmosphere, other vital natural resources, their quality of life, their property interests, and their liberties. They also have an interest in ensuring that the climate system remains stable enough to secure their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, rights that depend on a livable Future.”&lt;ref&gt;Juliana V. United States, First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief United States District Court, District of Oregon - Eugene Division

Filed 9/10/15 
&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the case was allowed to go to trial after US District Court Judge Ann Aiken denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss the case. In her opinion and order, she said, “Exercising my ‘reasoned judgment,’ I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society."&lt;ref&gt;Juliana V United States, Opinion and Order In the United States District Court for the District of Oregon Eugene Division

Issued 11/10/16
&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, the trial was put on hold with a stay. The Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments on the stay in November of 2017 and a ruling is expected in February of 2018.

== Standards of living usage ==

Discussions of intergenerational equity in standards of living have referenced differences between people of different ages as well as differences between people of different generations. Two perspectives on intergenerational equity in living standards have been distinguished by Rice, Temple and McDonald. The first perspective – a "cross-sectional" perspective – focuses on living standards at a particular point in time and how these living standards vary between people of different ages. The relevant issue is the degree to which, at a particular point in time, people of different ages enjoy equal living standards. The second perspective – a "cohort" perspective – focuses on living standards over a lifetime and how these living standards vary between people of different generations. For intergenerational equity, the relevant issue becomes the degree to which people of different generations enjoy equal living standards over their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald" /&gt; Three indicators of intergenerational equity in economic flows, such as income, have been proposed by D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux. Their first indicator originates from a cross-sectional perspective and describes the relative situation of an age group (retirees) with respect to the situation of another age group (younger people). Their second indicator originates from a cohort perspective and compares the standards of living of successive generations at the same age. D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux's third indicator is a combination of the two previous criteria and is both an inter-age indicator and an intergenerational indicator.&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadjiElMekkaouiNavaux" /&gt;

In Australia, notable equality has been achieved in living standards, as measured by consumption, among people between the ages of 20 and 75 years. Substantial inequalities exist, however, between different generations, with older generations experiencing lower living standards in real terms at particular ages than younger generations. One way to illustrate these inequalities is to look at how long different generations took to achieve a level of consumption of $30,000 per year (2009-10 Australian dollars). At one extreme, people born in 1935 achieved this level of consumption when they were roughly 50 years of age, on average. At the other extreme, Millennials born in 1995 had achieved this level of consumption by the time they were around 10 years of age.&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald" /&gt;

Considerations such as this have led some scholars to argue that standards of living have tended to increase generation over generation in most countries, as development and technology have progressed. When taking this into account, younger generations may have inherent privileges over older generations, which may offset the redistribution of wealth towards older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy Fifth Edition (c) 2016|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=2016|isbn=978-0716786559|location=Massachusetts, United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elderly care usage ==

Some scholars consider the changing cultural trends that move society away from the norm of adult children caring for elderly parents to be an intergenerational equity issue. The older generation had to care for their parents, as well as their own children, while the younger generation must only care for their children. This is especially true in countries with weak social security systems. Professor Sang-Hyop Lee describes the presence of this phenomenon in South Korea, explaining that the current elderly now have the highest poverty rate among any developed country. He notes that it is particularly frustrating because the elderly usually invest a lot in their children's education, and they now feel betrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sang-Hyop Lee on the middle-income trap and demographic crisis in East Asia|last=Willian|first=Caroline|date=March 27, 2017|work=Asia Experts Forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars express different opinions on which generation is truly disadvantaged by elderly care. Professor Steven Wisensale describes the burden on current working age adults in developed economies, who must care for more elderly parents and relatives for a longer period of time. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing involvement of women in the workforce, and by the dropping fertility rate, leaving the burden for caring for parents, as well as aunts, uncles, and grandparents, on fewer children.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Wisensale PhD (2005) Aging Societies and Intergenerational Equity Issues, Journal of Feminist Family Therapy, 17:3-4, 79-103, DOI: 10.1300/J086v17n03_05 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Social justice usage ==

Conversations about intergenerational equity are also relevant to [[social justice]] arenas as well, where issues such as [[health care]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A. (1997) "Intergenerational equity: An exploration of the 'fair innings' argument." ''Health Economics. 6''(2):117-32.&lt;/ref&gt; are equal in importance to [[youth rights]] and [[youth voice]] are pressing and urgent. There is a strong interest within the legal community towards the application of intergenerational equity in law.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brein, M. (n.d.) ''Not, 'Is it Irreparable?' But, 'Is it Unnecessary?' Thoughts on a Practical Limit for Intergenerational Equity Suits.'' Eugene, OR: Constitutional Law Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Korean nationalist historiography}}

===Early usage and origins===
Contrary to popular belief in the Koreas, the contemporary Korean ideology of a "pure Korean race" began only in the early 20th century when the Japanese annexed Korea&lt;ref name=myers /&gt; and launched a campaign to persuade them that they were of the same pure racial stock as the Japanese themselves.&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt;

In the colonial period, the Imperial Japanese's assimilation policy claimed that Koreans and Japanese were of common origin but the former always subordinate. The pure blood theory was used to justify colonialist policies to replace Korean cultural traditions with Japanese ones in order to supposedly get rid of all distinctions and achieve equality between Koreans and inlanders.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Ethnic pride source of prejudice, discrimination] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053258/http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802 |date=2011-07-20 }}, Gi-Wook Shin, Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The policy included changing Korean names into Japanese, exclusive use of Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese ethical system, and Shinto worship.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt; [[Brian Reynolds Myers]], a professor at [[Dongseo University]], argues that seeing the failure of the pure [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] policy, Japanese imperial ideologues changed their policy into creating a Korean ethnic-patriotism on par with the Japanese one. They encouraged Koreans to take pride in their Koreanness, in their history, heritage, culture and "dialect" as a brother nation going back to a common ancestry with the Japanese. Thus, Korean race nationalism can be seen as a deliberate and direct creation of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].&lt;ref name="myers"/&gt;{{page number needed|date=December 2016}}

===Independence===
[[File:Baitou Mountain Tianchi.jpg|thumb|right|Heaven Lake of [[Baekdu Mountain]] where [[Hwanung]], [[Dangun]]'s father, is said to have descended from heaven, constitutes a foundation for the legend of blood purity in Korean]]

[[Shin Chaeho]] (1880–1936), the founder of the nationalistic historiography of modern Korea and a [[Korean independence movement]] activist, published his influential book of reconstructed history ''[[Joseon Sanggosa]]'' (''The Early History of Joseon'') in 1924–25, proclaiming that Koreans are descendants of [[Dangun]], the legendary ancestor of Korean people, who merged with Buyo of [[Manchuria]] to form the [[Goguryeo]] people.&lt;ref name=gries&gt;The Koguryo Controversy,
National Identity, and Sino-Korean Relations Today [http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf], Peter Hays Gries, Institute for US-China Issues, The University of Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing from the Japanese theory of nation, Shin Chaeho located the martial roots of the Korean in Goguryeo, which he depicted as [[militarist]] and expansionist which turned out to inspire pride and confidence in the resistance against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt; In order to establish Korean uniqueness, he also replaced the story of [[Gija Joseon]], whose founder ([[Jizi|Gija]]) was the paternal uncle or brother of the Chinese [[Shang]] emperor [[King Zhou of Shang|Zhou]], with the Dangun legend&lt;ref&gt;Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria: Som Cj’aeho and the Politics of Territorial History in Korea," in The Journal of Asian Studies, 56, no. 1 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that it was an important way to establish Korea’s uniqueness.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt;

After independence in the late 1940s, despite the split between North and South Korea, neither side disputed the ethnic homogeneity of the Korean nation based on a firm conviction that they are purest descendant of a legendary genitor and half-god figure called Dangun who founded [[Gojoseon]] in 2333 BCE based on the description of the ''[[Dongguk Tonggam]]'' (1485).&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=694&amp;isid=30674&amp;arid=657709&amp;topMenu=&amp;topMenu1= Old Choson and the Culture of the Mandolin-shaped Bronze Dagger], Kim Jung-bae&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In both Koreas, pure blood theory is a common belief,&lt;ref name=soksoo&gt;Kim Sok-soo, professor at Kyungpook National University, cited in Park Chung-a, "[http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html Myth of Pure-Blood Nationalism Blocks Multi-Ethnic Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232752/http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html |date=2011-07-25 }}," ''The Korea Times'', August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with even some South Korean presidents subscribing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|title=What the West gets wrong about North Korea's motives, and why some South Koreans admire the North|first=B.R.|last=Myers|publisher=The Conversation|date=September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916082701/http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates on this topic can be found sporadic in the South, whereas the public opinion in the North is hard to access. In a nationalistic view, to impugn or challenge the theory would have been tantamount to betraying Koreanness in the face of the challenge of an alien ethnic nation.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;

Some Korean scholars observed that the pure blood theory served as a useful tool for the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt; It was especially true in the dictatorial leaderships by former presidents [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] when nationalism was incorporated into anti-Communism.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt;

===Role in contemporary South Korean society===
In South Korea, the notion of "pure blood" results in discrimination toward people of both "foreign-blood" and "mixed blood".&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; Those with this "mixed blood" or "foreign blood" are sometimes referred to as ''Honhyeol'' ({{Korean|혼혈|{{lang|ko|[[wikt:混#Korean|混]][[wikt:血#Korean|血]]}}}}) in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Timothy|title=Rethinking Belongingness in Korea: Transnational Migration, ‘Migrant Marriages,’ and the Politics of Multiculturalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/3605631/Rethinking_Belongingness_in_Korea_Transnational_Migration_Migrant_Marriages_and_the_Politics_of_Multiculturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]]&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; instead of [[jus solis]], which is a territorial principle that takes into account the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; In 2005, the opposition [[Grand National Party]] suggested a revision of the current South Korean nationality law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt;


According to Jon Huer, a columnist for the ''Korea Times'': {{quote|In trying to understand [South] Korea and [South] Koreans, we must recognize how important blood is to [South] Korea. [South] Koreans love blood, both in the real sense and metaphorically. They like to shed blood, sometimes their own in cut fingers and sometimes animal blood, in protest. They hold "blood relations" as supreme, above other links and connections. They often add "flesh" and "bone" to their rhetorical statements and preferences. In short, [South] Korea is quite fond of thinking of itself and its people in terms of blood...&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/06/272_47907.html|title=Korean Blood, Real and Imagined|date=3 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Challenges and the future====
Emma Campbell from the [[Australian National University]] argues that the conceptions of South Korean nationalism is evolving among young people and that a new form is emerging that has globalised cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Emma |date=22 June 2015 |title=The end of ethnic nationalism? Changing conceptions of national identity and belonging among young South Koreans |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nana.12120/full |journal=[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=483–502 |doi=10.1111/nana.12120 |access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics challenge the role of ethnicity in South Korean nationalism.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; According to Campbell’s study for which she interviewed 150 South Koreans in their twenties, the desire for reunification is declining. However, these who are in favor of a [[Korean unification]] state reasons different from [[ethnic nationalism]]. The respondents stated that they only wanted unification if it would not disrupt the life in the South or if North Korea achieves economic parity with the South. A small number of respondents further mentioned that they support a "unification on the condition that it did not take place in their lifetime."&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; Another reason stated for the wish for unification was the access to North Korea’s natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; This notion of evolving nationalism has been further elaborated by the meaning of ''uri nara'' ({{lang-ko|우리나라}} ''my country'' [sic!]) for young South Koreans, which only refers to South Korea for them instead to the whole Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 488-489 --&gt; Campbell’s interviews further showed that many young South Koreans have no problems to accepting foreigners as part of ''uri nara''.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 492 --&gt;

====Criticism====
B. R. Myers noted in a 2010 ''New York Times'' editorial that there was relatively little public outrage in South Korea over the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ROKS ''Cheonan'']] earlier that year, which he attributed partly to a feeling of sympathy towards North Korea among South Koreans, resulting from a closer identification with the Korean race than with the South Korean state.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |title=South Korea's Collective Shrug |date=27 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024409/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |archivedate=April 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers also stated that race nationalism in South Korea undermines the South Korean citizenry's patriotism towards South Korea by increasing sympathy towards North Korea, thus threatening the country's national security in the face of North Korean aggression, a sentiment shared by ''Korea Times'' columnist Jon Huer.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt; He stated that South Koreans' race nationalism "is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/08/01/51/0302000000AEN20110801002700315F.HTML|title=(Yonhap Feature) Brian Myers: Korea's most dangerous writer? - YONHAP NEWS|website=english.yonhapnews.co.kr|quote=This is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers has also stated that conversely, North Korea does not suffer from this dilemma as by and large the North Korean people tend to equate the "Korean race" and the country of North Korea as being one and the same, unlike in South Korea where the "Korean race" and South Korea are largely seen as different entities, the former positively, the latter negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freekorea.us/2017/08/01/propaganda-in-the-age-of-kim-jong-un-a-discussion-with-professor-b-r-myers/#sthash.eScL76im.dpbs|title=Propaganda in the age of Kim Jong-Un: A discussion with Professor B.R.

== Social issues ==
[[File:Hines Ward vs. Chiefs.jpg|thumb|upright|American football player [[Hines Ward]]'s visit to South Korea in 2006 has stirred debate if the country's society should be more accepting of "mixed blood" people.]]

As part of the deterioration of relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, North Korea  forced its male citizens who had married Soviet and Eastern European women to divorce, whereupon the women, a few hundred, were expelled from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Lankov, The Real North Korea. Life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia (Oxford 2015) page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  North Korea is alleged to have abducted foreign women in the 1970s to marry to foreign men that immigrated to North Korea in order to keep these men from having children with North Korean women.&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt; North Korea is accused of killing babies born to North Korean mothers and Chinese fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3204509.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - N Korea 'kills detainees' babies'|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, American football player [[Hines Ward]], who was born in Seoul to a South Korean mother and a [[African American|black American]] father, became the first South Korean-born American to win the NFL Super Bowl's MVP award. This achievement threw him into the media spotlight in South Korea.&lt;ref name=finder&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06099/680735-195.stm| title=Hines Ward scores big for social change| author=Chuck Finder| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he travelled to South Korea for the first time, he raised unprecedented attention to the acceptance of "mixed-blood" children.

However, while some South Koreans are fascinated by the bi-racial sportsman, the majority of ordinary mixed-race people and migrant workers face various forms of discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; In 2007, the "Korean pure blood theory" became an international issue when the U.N.

In 2007 the South Korean government passed the [[Act on Treatment of Foreigners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=47580|title=Korean Laws in English - Act on the Treatment of Foreigners in Korea|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|title=Minority Rights Group International : South Korea : South Korea Overview|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613001710/http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hurights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2008/10/south-korea-support-for-multicultural-families-act-enacted.html|title=South Korea; Support for Multicultural Families Act Enacted - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] praised the Act on Treatment of Foreigners, but also expressed a number of concerns. The Committee was concerned "about the persistence of widespread societal discrimination against foreigners, including migrant workers and children born from inter-ethnic unions, in all areas of life, including employment, marriage, housing, education and interpersonal relationships." It also noted that the terminology such as "pure blood" and "mixed blood" used in South Korea, including by the government, is widespread, and may reinforce concepts of [[Racial superiority|racist superiority]]. The committee recommended improvement in the areas of treatment of migrant workers, abuse of and violence against foreign women married to South Korean citizens, and trafficking of foreign women for the purpose of sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.&lt;ref name=uncom&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/473424062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted that contrary to popular domestic perception, South Korea was no longer "ethnically homogenous".&lt;ref name=nytimes2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=2 November 2009|location=New York|title=Race|publisher=New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legislation aimed at improving the integration of ethnic minorities into South Korean society, the [[Support for Multicultural Families Act]], was passed in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=58481|title=Korean Laws in English - SUPPORT FOR MULTICULTURAL FAMILIES ACT|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and revised in 2011).&lt;ref name=hurights/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=89160|title=Gov’t extends definition of multicultural families|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Fürst, Der Doctor Schnabel von Rom (Holländer version).png|thumb|Copper engraving of Doctor Schnabel [i.e. Dr. Beak] (a [[plague doctor]] in 17th-century Rome) with a satirical macaronic poem ("''Vos Creditis, als eine Fabel,'' / ''quod scribitur vom Doctor Schnabel''")]]

'''Macaronic language''' refers to text using a mixture of [[language]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|title=Macaronic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022203122/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[bilingual pun]]s or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote [[hybrid word]]s, which are effectively "internally macaronic". A rough equivalent in spoken language is [[code-switching]], a term in [[linguistics]] referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |title=Definition of Macaronic |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181212/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macaronic Latin''' in particular is a jumbled [[jargon]] made up of [[vernacular]] words given [[Latin language|Latin]] endings, or for Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a [[pastiche]] (compare [[dog Latin]]).

The word ''[[wikt:Macaronic|macaronic]]'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''macaronicus'' which is from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maccarone'' ("dumpling", regarded as coarse peasant fare).  The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or [[satire|satirical]] intent or effect.  It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.

==History==

===Mixed Latin-vernacular lyrics in Medieval Europe===
Texts that mixed [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[vernacular language]] apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the [[Middle Ages]]—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, [[minstrel]]s and storytellers.

An early example is from 1130, in the [[Gospel book]] of [[Munsterbilzen Abbey]].  The following sentence mixes late [[Old Dutch]] and Latin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
et omnium virtutum pleniter plena
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: ''This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.''

The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French.  Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous [[Carol (music)|carol]] ''[[In Dulci Jubilo]]'', whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of [[Greek language|Greek]].  While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.

Another early example is in the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] recitals ''[[Wakefield Mystery Plays|The Towneley Plays]]'' (c.1460).  In ''[[The Talents (play)|The Talents]]'' (play 24), [[Pontius Pilate]] delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.

A number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,
      Probat hoc mors tot validorum
  The Kyng þerof had small
      fuit in manibus cupidorum.
  yt had ful hard hansell,
      dans causam fine dolorum;
  vengeaunce nedes most fall,
      propter peccata malorum
  ''(etc)''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several [[Anthem]]s also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by [[Thomas Morley]], the Latin is used as a refrain:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Nolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.
Father I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.
Father, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.
Father, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
Father, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;
Ev'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,
but suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: "'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour." An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.

===Latin–Italian macaronic verse===
The term ''macaronic'' is believed to have originated in [[Padua]] in the late 15th century, apparently from ''maccarona'', a kind of pasta or [[dumpling]] eaten by peasants at that time.  (That is also the presumed origin of  ''[[maccheroni]]''.)&lt;ref name="linphil"&gt;{{cite web |author=Fran Hamilton |url=http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |title=LinguaPhile online magazine, September 2007 |publisher=Porticobooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210181651/http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its association with the genre comes from the ''[[Macaronea]]'', a comical poem by [[Tifi Odasi]] in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489.  Another example of the genre is ''[[Tosontea]]'' by [[Corrado of Padua]], which was published at about the same time as Tifi's ''Macaronea''.

Tifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to [[satire|satirize]] the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time.  While this "macaronic Latin" (''macaronica verba'') could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.&lt;ref name="macver"&gt;{{cite web |author=Giorgio Bernardi Perini |title=Macaronica Verba. Il divenire di una trasgressione linguistica nel seno dell'Umanesimo |url=http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2000/bernardi.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=fondazionecanussio.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217184031/http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2000/bernardi.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of [[Francesco Colonna]] (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, [[Greek (language)|Greek]], and occasionally others.  However, while the ''Hypnerotomachia'' is contemporary with Tifi's ''Macaronea'', its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.

Tifi's ''Macaronea'' was a popular success, and the writing of [[humour|humorous]] texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was ''[[Baldo (Teofilo Folengo book)|Baldo]]'' by [[Teofilo Folengo]], who described his own verses as "a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter".&lt;ref name="folenmac"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford University Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |title=Teofilo Folengo in The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-09-01 |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022034217/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other mixed-language lyrics===
Macaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread [[bilingualism]] or [[language contact]], such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century.  Macaronic traditional songs such as ''[[Siúil A Rúin]]'' are quite common in Ireland.  In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] immigrants to [[Glasgow]], using English and [[Scottish Gaelic]] as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment.  An example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |archivedate=25 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I came down to Glasgow first,&lt;br /&gt;
a-mach air Tìr nan Gall.&lt;br /&gt;
I was like a man adrift,&lt;br /&gt;
air iomrall 's doll air chall.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Folk and popular music of the [[Andes]] frequently alternates between Spanish and the given [[South American]] language of its region of origin.

Some [[Persian poetry|Classical Persian poems]] were written with alternating [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] verses or hemistichs, most famously by [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|title=SAʿDI – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117020202/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hafez Shirazi|Hafez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-iii|title=HAFEZ   iii.

Macaronic verse was also common in [[medieval]] [[India]], where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous [[Hindi]] and the [[Persian language]].  This style was used by the famous poet [[Amir Khusro]] and played a major role in the rise of the [[Urdu]] or [[Hindustani language]].

The [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] song "Caress Me Down" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|title=Sublime - Caress Me Down Lyrics - MetroLyrics|author=|date=|website=www.metrolyrics.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426200541/http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintentional macaronic language===
{{main|Homophonic translation}}

Occasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is [[Xenophon]]'s line "they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it" ({{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔλαβον πόλιν· άλλα γὰρ ἐλπὶς ἔφη κακά}}, ''ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká''). [[Mondegreen|Read]] [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching#France|in the French manner]], this becomes "Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca." ("Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.")&lt;ref&gt;Arbre d'Or eBooks. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172950/http://www.arbredor.com/vmchk/pluton-ciel-que-janus-proserpine Pluton ciel que Janus Proserpine...]". {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern macaronic literature==

===Prose===
Macaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]] and [[Beppe Fenoglio]].  Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in [[Umberto Eco]]'s  ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', and the peasant hero of his ''[[Baudolino]]''.  [[Dario Fo]]'s ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") features [[grammelot]] sketches using language with macaronic elements.

The 2001 novel ''[[The Last Samurai (novel)|The Last Samurai]]'' by [[Helen DeWitt]]&lt;ref name="lastsam"&gt;DeWitt, Helen. ''The Last Samurai'' (Chatto and Windus, 2000: {{ISBN|0-7011-6956-7}}; Vintage, 2001: {{ISBN|0-09-928462-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; includes portions of Japanese, [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], and [[Inuktitut]], although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.

Macaronic games are used by the literary group [[Oulipo]] in the form of interlinguistic [[homophonic transformation]]: replacing
a known phrase with homophones from another language.  The archetypal example is by [[François Le Lionnais]], who transformed [[John Keats]]' "A thing of beauty is a joy forever" into "Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'.&lt;ref name="genette"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the book ''[[Mots d'Heures]]''.

Macaronisms figure prominently in ''[[The Trilogy]]'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel ''Finnegans Wake''.

===Poetry===
Two well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Maid of Athens, ere we part (George Byron)|Maid of Athens, ere we part]]'' (1810, in English with a [[Greek language|Greek]] refrain);&lt;ref name="maidat"&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Byron |url=http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |title=Maid of Athens |publisher=readytogoebooks.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070133/http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Lucas de Pearsall|Pearsall]]'s translation of the carol ''In Dulci Jubilo'' (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).

An example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem ''[[Carmen Possum]]'' ("''The Opossum's Song''"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes.  Other similar examples are ''[[The Motor Bus]]'' by [[A. D. Godley]], and the anonymous ''[[Up I arose (poem)|Up I arose in verno tempore]]''.

Recent examples are the ''mużajki'' or 'mosaics' (2007) of [[Malta|Maltese]] poet [[Antoine Cassar]]&lt;ref name="mosaics"&gt;Grech, Marija. [http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&amp;pageId=327 "Mosaics: A symphony of multilingual poetry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134017/http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&amp;pageId=327 |date=28 March 2009 }}, ''The Daily Star'' (Kuwait), 25 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; mixing English, Spanish, [[Maltese language|Maltese]], Italian, and French; works of Italian writer [[Guido Monte]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |title=see for ex. |publisher=Wordswithoutborders.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092233/http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |archivedate=12 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English.&lt;ref name="Blatny"&gt;Wheatley, David. [http://www.cprw.com/Wheatley/blatny.htm "The Homeless Tongue: Ivan Blatný"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081150/http://www.cprw.com/Wheatley/blatny.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}. ''Contemporary Poetry Review'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brian P. Cleary]]'s "What Can I C'est?" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book "Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry":

&lt;blockquote&gt;My auntie Michelle is big in the BON&lt;br /&gt;
(As well as the hip and the thigh).&lt;br /&gt;
And when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails&lt;br /&gt;
And ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of [[John O'Mill|Johan van der Meulen]], a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), [[Breda]], the [[Netherlands]].  These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.

===Theatre===
The finale of act 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]] [[Iolanthe]] has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|title=W.S.Gilbert - Iolanthe, ACT I|author=|date=|website=www.stagebeauty.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lord Mountararat:''' This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his ''dolce far niente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Chancellor:''' Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, ''festina lente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Tolloller:''' I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for ''repente'')...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Mountararat:''' Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all ''contradicente''...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our lordly style you shall not quench with base ''canaille''! (That word is French.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
Distinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar ''plebs''! (A Latin word.)&lt;br /&gt;
Twould fill with joy and madness stark the ''oι πoλλoί''! (A Greek remark.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
One Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies.  In [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] comedy ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', the title character  speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. "Cheese-und-cracken").  This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of [[Benito Mussolini]], using Italian foods (such as [[salami]] and [[ravioli]]) as insults.

Other movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]'' and ''[[Brancaleone alle crociate]]'' (d. [[Mario Monicelli]]), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the [[Italo-Normans]] using words from modern [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]).

===Song===

Macaronic language appearing in popular songs include [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[That's Amore]]" (Italian and English), the [[Beatles]]’ "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]" (French and English), [[The Clash]]’s "[[Spanish Bombs]]" and [[José Feliciano]]’s "[[Feliz Navidad (song)|Feliz Navidad]]" (Spanish and English), the [[Talking Heads]] "[[Psycho Killer]]" (French and English), and [[The Weeknd]]'s [[Echoes of Silence|Montreal]] (French and English).

{{History of South Asia}}

The '''Malwa culture''' was a [[Chalcolithic]] [[archaeological culture]] which existed in the [[Malwa]] region of Central India and parts of [[Maharashtra]] in the [[Deccan Peninsula]]. It is mainly dated to {{circa|1600|1300}} BCE,&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Basant (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KOJ8aT3xYPoC''The City and the Country in Early India: A Study of Malwa''], p.85&lt;/ref&gt; but calibrated [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] have suggested that the beginning of this culture may be as early as {{circa}} 2000-1750 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NavdatoliGoblet1300BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic goblet from Navdatoli, Malwa, 1300 BCE.]]

This culture is characterized by the increasing dominance of the agricultural way of life, but also incorporated pastoralist and hunting groups. The people cultivated wheat, barley, legumes, and later rice, and domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. At most of the settlements, there is no evidence of urban planning, rather a "haphazard" distribution of houses, but some of the largest sites have evidence of planned settlement, large houses, and public architecture. Most dwellings were round huts made from [[wattle-and-daub]]. There are also small round huts used for storing grain, and large rectangular structures which may have been used for religious performances.&lt;ref&gt;Basant (2012), pp.85-91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh (2008), pp.227-229&lt;/ref&gt;

Their pottery was red or orange, and painted with geometric, floral, animal, and human designs in black. Copper and stone were used to make tools. Beads of [[semi-precious stone]]s have been found. Objects made from seashells indicate trade with coastal communities in [[Gujarat]], such as [[Bharuch]]. Evidence of religion includes bull idols, worship of trees, snakes, and goddesses, and altars for fire sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Basant (2012), pp.85-91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh (2008), pp.227-229&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites of the Malwa Culture include [[Daimabad]], [[Inamgaon]], [[Kayatha]], [[Nagda]], [[Vidisha]], [[Eran]], [[Mandsaur]], and [[Navdatoli]] (near [[Maheshwar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Basant (2012), pp.290-292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh (2008), p.228&lt;/ref&gt;

It is preceded by the [[Kayatha]], [[Ahar-Banas culture|Ahar-Banas]], and [[Savalda culture|Savalda]] cultures, and succeeded by the [[Jorwe culture]] and the [[Black and red ware culture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">The '''Medientage München''' (Munich Media Days) are held annually in [[Munich]] as a congress of the communications industry. An exhibition is organized and occurs at the same time. Every year in October, media entrepreneurs, media makers, and media politicians meet for three days. In 2015 more than 6,200 participants attended the congress, exhibition and events around the Medientage München.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/61644/3155621 | title=MEDIENTAGE MÜNCHEN 2015 mit mehr als 6.200 Besuchern | author= | date=23 October 2015 | website=presseportal.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medientage München 2015 took place from 21 to 23 October, at the [[Internationales Congress Center München|International Congress Center (ICM)]] of [[Messe München]] with the support from the [[Bavaria|Bavarian State]] and the ''Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting'' (Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien – BLM).

== History ==
Medientage München were founded in 1987 by Wolf-Dieter Ring and [[Edmund Stoiber]] (both members of the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]] at the time), on behalf of the Bavarian government. The event is intended to bring private radio and television broadcasters, newspaper and magazine publishers, together with public broadcasters in joint discussions. The discussion topics range from current media policies relating to [[advertising]], to [[marketing]] and program quality issues in regards to the protection of minors. The Medientage München GmbH is the organizer of the congress since 1999. Managing directors are Reiner Müller, Johannes Kors and Christopher Tusch. The GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting (BLM).

== Congress ==
The Medientage München are considered one of the most important events of the [[Germany|German]] media industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wuv.de/medien/medientage_2012_die_neuen_gesetze_der_medienwelt | title= Medientage 2012: Die neuen Gesetze der Medienwelt | author=Katharina Hannen | date=27 July 2012 | website= | publisher=Werben &amp;Verkaufen | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers are from the television, radio, print and mobile, and digital business industries, along with advertisers, media politicians and filmmakers. To kick-off the Medientage München, the [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Minister-President of Bavaria]] opens the event with the ''Mediengipfel'' (Media Summit).

== Media exhibition ==
At the exhibition, which is held at the same time, presentations from companies, institutions, and initiatives from media and communication industries can be found. On the grounds of the ''MedienCampus Bayern'', media training centers, journalism schools and employers in the media industry present themselves. Young professionals can find out about education and training for the media industry.

== Other events ==
Alongside the event is the “Nacht der Medien” ("Night of the media").

In addition to the central meeting point of the Medientage München, the Medientage München GmbH organizes further events to assist the communication industry – including the Audiovisual Media Days (AVMD): A congress for motion pictures media, marketing and corporate communication, that is held annually in Munich. Where some 400 representatives of the motion picture industry meet to report on trends surrounding online video, smart and web TV.

Additionally are the Munich Gaming and the Medientage Special (Media Days Special).

'''Metaphorical language''' is the use of a complex system of [[metaphor]]s to create a sub-language within a common language which provides the basic terms ([[verb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]) to express metaphors.

People who over-expose themselves to environments atypical from their usual habits tend to develop understanding of new words and apply new meanings to existing words. Such sources could include: absorbing a native language spoken in a different dialects or countries, a language other than their own and fictional language from books, music, films and videogames.

People who are classified with Autistic Spectrum Disorder tend to communicate metaphorically rather than with common phrases. It is currently not known why they can do this, although they also express other abnormalities from level 1 and 2 psychedelic experiences.

==History==
Metaphorical language is a common feature of religious discussion, (for example [[midrash]] or medieval [[Roman Catholic]] "[[Commonplace book|common places]]" or modern [[biblespeak]]) wherein fluency in a religious text is often a prerequisite to participating fully in a conversation.  Not just [[conceptual metaphor]]s (part of every language) that express belief in analogy between generic concepts, but extremely specific metaphors involving [[proper name]]s or use of concrete nouns to express generics or processes.

The [[Tao te ching]] is considered by many to be almost entirely metaphorical. For example, change is usually expressed with the “water” character, not the “change” character. 

To the outsider, such terms in such combinations will likely seem [[esoteric]] or otherwise unintelligible.  Only by learning the underlying patterns of events that are considered important in the religion or ethical or political system, would one be able to comprehend what was said.  The religious text thus acts as a [[code book]].  Since many religious authorities believe in the self-evident truth of their [[doctrine]]s, a mere exposure to the [[truth]] in the book would tend to convert outsiders trying to learn the language.  However, use of such language is not confined to religious groups

Use of metaphorical language was historically common among [[secret society]] devotees, for instance the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]s that resisted Imperial rulers, and even some modern [[troll organization]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19512">'''Muscle dysmorphia''' is a subtype of the obsessive mental disorder [[body dysmorphic disorder]], but is often also grouped with [[eating disorders]].&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monaghan-Atkinson&gt;Lee F Monaghan &amp; Michael Atkinson, ''Challenging Myths of Masculinity: Understanding Physical Cultures'' (Surrey: [[Ashgate]], 2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys-pBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=dysmorphia+megarexia p 86].&lt;/ref&gt;  In muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called "'''bigorexia'''", "'''megarexia'''", or "'''reverse [[anorexia]]'''", the delusional or exaggerated belief is that one's own body is too small, too skinny, insufficiently muscular, or insufficiently lean, although in most cases, the individual's build is normal or even exceptionally large and muscular already.&lt;ref name=Phillips2009&gt;Katharine A Phillips, ''Understanding Body Dysmorphic Disorder: An Essential Guide'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=uRTcOYgWj9cC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=muscle+dysmorphia 50–51].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leone-etal&gt;James E Leone, Edward J Sedory &amp; Kimberly A Gray, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1323298 "Recognition and treatment of muscle dysmorphia and related body image disorders"], ''Journal of Athletic Training'', 2005 Oct–Dec;'''40'''(4):352–359.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Muscle dysmorphia affects mostly males, particularly those involved in sports where body size or weight are competitive factors, becoming rationales to gain muscle or become leaner.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  The quest to seemingly fix one's body consumes inordinate time, attention, and resources, as on exercise routines, dietary regimens, and nutritional supplementation, while use of [[anabolic steroids]] is also common.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Other body-dysmorphic preoccupations that are not muscle-dysmorphic are usually present as well.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;

==History==

A rather newly recognized mental disorder, muscle dysmorphia was first conceptualized by healthcare professionals in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Pope93"&gt;Pope HG, Katz DL &amp; Hudson JI (1993), "Anorexia nervosa and 'reverse anorexia' among 108 male bodybuilders", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''34'''(6):406-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope97"&gt;Pope HG Jr, Gruber AJ, Choi P, Olivardia R &amp; Phillips KA (1997), "Muscle dysmorphia: An underrecognized form of body dysmorphic disorder", ''Psychosomatics: Journal of Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry'' '''38'''(6):548-557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tod16"&gt;Tod D, Edwards C &amp; Cranswick I (2016), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977020 "Muscle dysmorphia: Current insights"], ''Psychology Research and Behavior Management'' '''9''':179–188.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, 50% of peer-reviewed articles on it had been published in the prior five years.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; 

Although muscle dysmorphia was initially viewed as [[anorexia nervosa]]'s inverse—questing not to be small and thin, but to be large and muscular&lt;ref name="Pope93"/&gt;—later researchers fit the subjective experience to [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;  (Some debate continues.)

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognized muscle dysmorphia in 2013 with the fifth edition of the ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.  This ''DSM-5'' classifies it under body dysmorphic disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM"&gt;American Psychiatric Association, ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', Fifth Edition (Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Muscle dysmorphia is absent from the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]''' present edition, the [[ICD-10|tenth]], published in 1992.&lt;ref name="Filho16"&gt;dos Santos Filho CA, Tirico PP, Stefano SC, Touyz SW &amp; Claudino AM (2016), "Systematic review of the diagnostic category muscle dysmorphia", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''50'''(4):322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Although body dissatisfaction has been found in males as young as age six, muscle dysmorphia's onset is estimated  at usually between ages 18 and 20.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe04"&gt;McCabe MP &amp; Ricciardelli LA (2004), "Body image dissatisfaction among males across the lifespan: A review of past literature", ''Journal of Psychosomatic Research'' '''56'''(6):675-685.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to American psychiatry's ''DSM-5'', muscle dysmorphia is indicated by the diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder via "the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular", and this specifier holds even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, too, as is often the case.&lt;ref name="DSM"/&gt;

Psychologists have identified further clinical features of muscle dysmorphia, such as excess engagement in activities to increase muscularity, activities such as dietary restriction, over-exercise, and injection of growth-enhancing drugs.&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;  Persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia generally spend over three hours daily pondering increased muscularity, and feel unable to limit their weightlifting activities.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  As in anorexia nervosa, the reverse quest in muscle dysmorphia can be insatiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mosley PE|date=2009|title=Bigorexia: Bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They closely monitor their bodies and camouflage by wearing multiple clothing layers to appear larger.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

Muscle dysmorphia involves severe distress at having one's body viewed by others.&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt; Occupational and social functioning are impaired, and dietary regimes may interfere.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Patients often avoid activities, people, and places to conceal their perceived deficiency of size or muscularity.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; Roughly half of patients have poor or no insight that these perceptions are unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Cafri08"&gt;Cafri G, Olivardia R &amp; Thompson JK (2008), "Symptom characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity among males with muscle dysmorphia", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''49'''(4):374-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Patient histories reveal elevated rates of diagnoses of other mental disorders, including eating disorders, [[mood disorders]], [[anxiety disorders]], and [[substance use disorder]]&lt;ref name="Cafri08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitzeroth11"&gt;Hitzeroth V, Wessels C, Zungu-Dirwayi N, Oosthuizen P, &amp; Stein DJ (2001), "Muscle dysmorphia: A South African sample", ''Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences'' '''55'''(5):521-523.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as elevated rates of suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

==Prevalence==

Prevalence estimates for muscle dysmorphia have greatly varied, ranging from 1% to 54% of men.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Samples of gym members, weightlifters, and bodybuilders show higher prevalence than do samples from the general population.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Rates even higher have been found in users of anabolic steroids.&lt;ref name="Gruber99"&gt;Gruber AJ &amp; Pope HG (1999), "Compulsive weight lifting and anabolic drug abuse among women rape victims", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''40'''(4):273-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Filho16"/&gt; The disorder is rare in women but does occur, and has been noted especially in female bodybuilders who also have experienced sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber99"/&gt;  Crossing cultures, muscle dysmorphia is known to occur in China, South Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="Hitzeroth11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ung00"&gt;Ung EK, Fones CS, &amp; Ang AW (2000), Muscle dysmorphia in a young Chinese male, ''Annals of the Academy of Medicine'' (Singapore) '''29'''(1):135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soler13"&gt;Soler PT, Fernandes HM, Damasceno VO, et al. (2013), "Vigorexy and levels of exercise dependence in gym goers and bodybuilders", ''Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte'' '''19'''(5):343-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutsztein04"&gt;Rutsztein G, Casguet A, Leonardelli E, López P, Macchi M, Marola ME &amp; Redondo G (2004), "Imagen corporal en hombres y su relación con la dismorfia muscular", ''Revista Argentina De Clínica Psicológica'' '''13'''(2):119-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behar10"/&gt;  Yet this may be mediated substantially by exposure to Western ideals of muscularity, as populations less exposed tend to have lower prevalence.&lt;ref name="Yang05"&gt;Yang CJ, Gray P, &amp; Pope HG Jr, (2005), "Male body image in Raiwan versus the west: Yanggang Ahiqi meets the Adonis complex", ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''162'''(2):263-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==

Although muscle dysmorphia's development is unclear, several risk factors have been identified.

*Trauma and bullying: Versus the general population, persons manifesting muscle dysmorphia are more likely to have experienced or observed traumatic events like sexual assault or domestic violence,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber99"/&gt; or to have sustained adolescent bullying and ridicule for perceived deficiencies such as smallness, weakness, poor athleticism, or intellectual inferiority.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwwards16"&gt;Edwards C, Molnar G &amp; Tod D (2017), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/men0000072 "Searching for masculine capital: Experiences leading to high drive for muscularity in men"], ''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity'' '''18'''(4)"361-371.'&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased body mass may seem to reduce the threat of further mistreatment.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivardia01"&gt;Olivardia R (2001), "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the largest of them all? the features and phenomenology of muscle dysmorphia", ''Harvard Review of Psychiatry'' '''9'''(5):254-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sociopsychological traits: Low self-esteem associates with higher levels of body dissatisfaction and of muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"&gt;Grieve FG (2007), "A conceptual model of factors contributing to the development of muscle dysmorphia", ''Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention'' '''15'''(1):63-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased body size or muscularity may seem to enhance the masculine identity.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

*Media exposure: As Western media emphasize physical attractiveness, some marketing campaigns now exploit male body-image insecurities.&lt;ref name="Cohane01"&gt;Cohane GH, &amp; Pope HG Jr (2001), "Body image in boys: A review of the literature", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''29'''(4):373-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangweth01"&gt;Mangweth B, Pope HGJ, Kemmler G, Ebenbichler C, Hausmann A, et al. (2001), "Body image and psychopathology in male bodybuilders", ''Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'' '''70'''(1):38-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope01"&gt;Pope HG Jr, Olivardia R, Borowiecki JJ 3rd &amp; Cohane GH (2001), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11408837 "The growing commercial value of the male body: A longitudinal survey of advertising in women's magazines"], ''Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'' '''70'''(4):189-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leit01"&gt;Leit RA, Pope HG Jr, &amp; Gray JJ (2001), "Cultural expectations of muscularity in men: The evolution of playgirl centerfolds", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''29'''(1):90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the past 20 years, the number of men's-fitness magazines and of partially-undressed, well-muscled men in advertisements have increased.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivardia01"/&gt;  Such media provoke bodily comparisons and pressure individuals to conform,&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt; yet increase the gap between men's perceptions of their own muscularity versus their desired muscularity.&lt;ref name="Leit02"&gt;Leit RA, Gray JJ, &amp; Pope HG Jr (2002), "The media's representation of the ideal male body: A cause for muscle dysmorphia?", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''31'''(3):334-338.&lt;/ref&gt;  In college-aged men, a strong predictor of a muscularity quest is internalization of the idealized male bodies depicted in media.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S &amp; Bridges SK (2010)m The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory, ''Body Image'' '''7'''(1):32-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parent11"&gt;Parent MC &amp; Moradi B (2011), "His biceps become him: A test of objectification theory's application to drive for muscularity and propensity for steroid use in college men", ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''58'''(2):246-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Athletic involvement: Athletes tend to share some psychological factors that may predispose to muscle dysmorphia, factors including high levels of competitiveness, need for control, and perfectionism,&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;  and athletes tend to be more critical of their own bodies and body weight.&lt;ref name="Davis91"&gt;Davis C &amp; Cowles M (1991), "Body image and exercise: A study of relationships and comparisons between physically active men and women", ''Sex Roles'' '''25'''(1-2):33-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes who also fail to achieve performance standards may resort to the extreme body-modifying measures of muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt; Involvement in sports where size, strength, and weight raise competitive advantage or lessen disadvantage, associates with muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Cohane01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung01"&gt;Chung B (2001), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11600802 "Muscle dysmorphia: A critical review of the proposed criteria"], ''Perspect Biol Med'' '''44'''(4):565–574.&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletic ideals reinforce the social ideal of muscularity.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;  Conversely, those already disposed to muscle dysmorphia may be more likely to participate in such sports.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment of muscle dysmorphia can be stymied by a patient's unawareness that the preoccupation is disordered or by avoidance of treatment.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Scientific research on treatment of muscle dysmorphia is limited, the evidence largely in [[case reports]] and anecdotes,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; and no specific protocols have been validated.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Still, evidence supports the efficacy of [[Family Therapy|family-based therapy]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]], and pharmacotherapy with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; Also limited is research on [[prognosis]] of the untreated.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

==Reclassifications==

Muscle dysmorphia's classification has been widely debated, and alternative ''DSM'' classifications have been proposed.

*Eating disorder: Many of muscle dysmorphia's traits overlap with those of eating disorders,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffiths15"&gt;Griffiths S, Mond JM, Murray SB &amp; Touyz S (2015), "Positive beliefs about anorexia nervosa and muscle dysmorphia are associated with eating disorder symptomatology", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''49'''(9):812-820.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray13"&gt;Murray SB &amp; Touyz SW (2013), "Muscle dysmorphia: Towards a diagnostic consensus", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''47'''(3):206-207.&lt;/ref&gt; including focus on body weight, shape, and modification,&lt;ref name="Russell13"&gt;Russell J (2013), Commentary on: "Muscle Dysmorphia: Towards a diagnostic consensus". ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''47'''(3):284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas body dysmorphic disorder otherwise usually lacks such dietary and exercise components.&lt;ref name="Murray13"/&gt;  Also, persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia tend to score high on the [[Eating Attitudes Test]] and [[Eating Disorder Inventory]],&lt;ref name="Nieuwoudt12"&gt;Nieuwoudt JE, Zhou S, Coutts RA &amp; Booker R (2012), "Muscle dysmorphia: Current research and potential classification as a disorder", ''Psychology of Sport and Exercise'' '''13'''(5):569-577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behar10"&gt;Behar R &amp; Molinari D (2010), "Muscle dysmorphia, body image and eating behaviors in two male populations", ''Revista Médica de Chile'' '''138'''(11):1386-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; while muscle dysmorphia and anorexia nervosa share diagnostic crossover.&lt;ref name="Murray10"&gt;Murray SB, Rieger E, Touyz SW &amp; De la GG (2010), "Muscle dysmorphia and the DSM-V conundrum: Where does it belong? A review paper", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''43'''(6):483-491.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, both muscle dysmorphia and eating disorders associate with higher impairment than does body dysmorphic disorder otherwise.&lt;ref name="Pope05"&gt;Pope CG, Pope HG, Menard W, Fay C, Olivardia R, &amp; Phillips KA (2005), "Clinical features of muscle dysmorphia among males with body dysmorphic disorder: ''Body Image'' '''2'''(4):395-400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"&gt;Foster AC, Shorter GW, &amp; Griffiths MD (2015), "Muscle dysmorphia: Could it be classified as an addiction to body image?", ''J Behav Addict'' '''4'''(1):1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And treatment for eating disorders may be effective for muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Greenberg08"&gt;Greenberg ST &amp; Schoen EG (2008), "Males and eating disorders: Gender-based therapy for eating disorder recovery", ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'' '''39'''(4):464-471.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Behavioral addiction: Some researchers seek muscle dysmorphia's reclassification as a [[behavioral addiction]].&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell13"/&gt;  Muscle dysmorphia's effort to maintain [[body image]] is enacted through particular activities, such as exercise, diet, and related shopping,&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt; which activities, as in behavioral addiction, are highly valued, modify mood, and may cause interpersonal conflicts.&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;  Also, tolerance to muscle building and dietary restriction can drive escalation of these activities to restore physiological or psychological effects.&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;  Further, abstinence from these activities can provoke withdrawal symptoms, and relapse into excessive engagement is apt to occur.&lt;ref name="Griffiths15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;

'''Mysophobia''', also known as '''verminophobia''', '''germophobia''', '''germaphobia''', '''bacillophobia''' and '''bacteriophobia''', is a [[pathological fear]] of contamination and [[Microorganism|germs]]. The term was coined by [[William A. Hammond]] in 1879 when describing a case of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) exhibited in repeatedly washing one's hands.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrbqCbV5xvMC|title=Neurological Contributions|first=William Alexander|last=Hammond|date=1879|page=40|publisher=Putnam|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysophobia has long been related to compulsive [[hand washing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/cleanliness-rules-germaphobes-lives|title=Cleanliness Rules Germaphobes' Lives|website=WebMD|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names pertaining directly to the abnormal fear of dirt and filth include molysmophobia or molysomophobia, rhypophobia, and rupophobia, whereas the terms bacillophobia and bacteriophobia specifically refer to the fear of [[bacteria]] and [[microbes]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phobiasource.com/bacillophobia-fear-of-microbes/ |title=Bacillophobia – Fear of microbes |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}{{unreliable source|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mysophobia'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μύσος (''musos''), "uncleanness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmu%2Fsos1 μύσος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος (''phobos''), "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting via the Internet was limited to one vote for seven monuments per person/identity, but multiple voting was possible through telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-the-world-page/new7wonders-of-the-world/voting-analysis/ |title=Voting Analysis |work=World of New7Wonders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326001211/http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-the-world-page/new7wonders-of-the-world/voting-analysis/ |archivedate=2013-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the poll was considered unscientific.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt; According to [[John Zogby]], founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization [[Zogby International]], New7Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".&lt;ref name = "nwVFC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest.&lt;ref name="nwVFC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-wonders8jul08,0,299368.story?coll=la-default-underdog The Seven Wonders of the World, 2.0], ''Los Angeles Times'', 2007-07-07&lt;/ref&gt; After supporting the New7Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), by its bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007.&lt;ref name=N7W&amp;UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/2007/06/08/new7wonders-and-unesco-separate-organizations-supporting-common-goals/|title=New7Wonders and UNESCO: Separate organizations, common goals|work=World of New7Wonders|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/352|title=UNESCO confirms that it is not involved in the "New7Wonders of the World" campaign|publisher=UNESCO|date=July 9, 2007|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New7Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of broadcast rights and received no public funding or taxpayers' money.&lt;ref name="new7wonders.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/interesting-questions-and-answers/|title=Interesting questions and answers|work=World of New7Wonders|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211223818/http://world.new7wonders.com/interesting-questions-and-answers/|archivedate=2013-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the final announcement, New7Wonders said it didn't earn anything from the exercise and barely recovered its investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/206200.html Oh Taj! 7 wonders won’t get campaign money], indianexpress.com, 2007-07-22  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809024705/http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/206200.html |date=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although N7W describes itself as a not-for-profit organization, the company behind it—the New Open World Corporation (NOWC)—is a commercial business. All licensing and sponsorship money is paid to NOWC.

The foundation ran two subsequent programs: [[New7Wonders of Nature]], the subject of voting until 2011, and [[New7Wonders Cities]], which ended in 2014.

==Reactions==

===United Nations===
In 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation contracted a partnership with the United Nations in recognition of the efforts to promote the UN's Millennium Development Goals". The UN posted on its website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Votes for New7Wonders|url=https://www.un.org/partnerships/YNewsNew7Wonders.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The New7Wonders campaigns aim to contribute to the process of uplifting the well being and mutual respect of citizens around the world, through encouraging interaction, expression  opinion and direct participation by voting and polling on popular [[global issue]]s which are understandable to everyone.|United Nations Office of Partnerships}}

However, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in a press release on June 20, 2007, reaffirmed that it has no link with the "private initiative".  The press release concluded:&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

{{quote|There is no comparison between Mr. Weber's mediatised campaign and the scientific and educational work resulting from the inscription of sites on UNESCO's [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]]. The list of the 8 New Wonders of the World will be the result of a private undertaking, reflecting only the opinions of those with access to the Internet and not the entire world. This initiative cannot, in any significant and sustainable manner, contribute to the preservation of sites elected by this public.|UNESCO}}

===Brazil===
In Brazil there was a campaign ''Vote no Cristo'' (Vote for the Christ) which had the support of private companies, namely telecommunications operators that stopped charging voters to make telephone calls and SMS messages to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=4&amp;id_news=284917
 |title = Sete Maravilhas: Brasil comemora eleição de Cristo Redent    |language = Portuguese
 |accessdate = 2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, leading corporate sponsors including [[Banco Bradesco]] and [[Rede Globo]] spent millions of [[Brazilian real|reals]] in the effort to have the statue voted into the top seven.&lt;ref name="nwVFC" /&gt;  [[Newsweek]] reports the campaign was so pervasive that:&lt;ref name="nwVFC"/&gt;

{{quote|One morning in June, Rio de Janeiro residents awoke to a beeping text message on their cell phones: "Press 4916 and vote for Christ. It's free!" The same pitch had been popping up all over the city since late January—flashing across an electronic screen every time city-dwellers swiped their transit cards on city buses and echoing on TV infomercials that featured a reality-show celebrity posing next to the city's trademark Christ the Redeemer statue.|Elizabeth Dwoskin|''Newsweek''}}

According to an article in ''Newsweek'', around 10 million Brazilians had voted in the contest by early July.&lt;ref name="nwVFC" /&gt; This number is estimated as the New7Wonders Foundation never released such details about the campaign. An airplane message, with a huge inscription "4916 VOTE FOR CHRIST" flew in Rio de Janeiro for a month.

===Peru===
An intensive campaign led by the Peruvian Ministry of Commerce and Tourism in Peru had a great impact in the media and consequently Peruvian people voted massively for its national wonder.  The announcement of the new World Wonders generated great expectation and the election of [[Machu Picchu]] was celebrated nationwide.

===Chile===
The Chilean representative for [[Easter Island]]'s [[Moai]]s, Alberto Hotus, said Weber gave him a letter saying that the Moais had finished eighth and were morally one of the New Seven Wonders. Hotus said he was the only participant to receive such an apology.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lun.com/modulos/catalogo/paginas/2007/07/10/LUCPRDI04LU1007.htm?tipoPantalla=1024 Líder pascuense furioso porque le dieron a la isla un triunfo moral]" ''[[Las Últimas Noticias]]'' July 10, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055950/http://www.lun.com/modulos/catalogo/paginas/2007/07/10/LUCPRDI04LU1007.htm?tipoPantalla=1024 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
A campaign to publicize the [[Taj Mahal]] in India gathered speed  and it reached a climax in July 2007 with news channels, radio stations, and many celebrities asking people to vote for the Taj Mahal.

===Jordan===
Queen [[Rania Al-Abdullah of Jordan]] joined the campaign to back Petra, Jordan's national treasure.&lt;ref name="nwVFC" /&gt;

===Mexico===
There was a campaign on the news programs to encourage people to vote for [[Chichen Itzá]].{{citation needed|date= June 2013}}

'''Oi!''' is a subgenre of [[punk rock]] that originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", ''Vox'', June 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The music and its associated [[subculture]] had the goal of bringing together [[punk subculture|punks]], [[skinhead]]s and other [[working class|working-class]] youth.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bushell, ‘Oi! – The Debate’, Sounds, 24 January 1981, 30–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Bushell, Dance Craze (London, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oi! movement was partly a response to the perception that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of [[The Business (band)|The Business]] guitarist Steve Kent, "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic...and losing touch".&lt;ref name="Robb_history"&gt;[[John Robb (musician)|Robb, John]] (2006). ''Punk Rock: An Oral History'' (London: Elbury Press). {{ISBN|0-09-190511-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; André Schlesinger, singer of [[The Press (band)|The Press]], said, "Oi shares many similarities with [[folk music]], besides its often simple musical structure; quaint in some respects and crude in others, not to mention brutally honest, it usually tells a story based in truth."&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2004). ''Burning Britain'' (London: Cherry Red), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "Such Fun", from ''[[Oi! Oi! That's Yer Lot!]]'', by [[The Blood]] is an extension of the 1977 [[Sex Pistols]] song "God Save the Queen" which attacks the abuse of power by those who hold themselves in a royal or religious majesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/theblood/bio|title=The Blood (theblood) on Myspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://working-class-lyrics.tripod.com/workingclasslyrics/id10.html|title=The Blood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rock.rapgenius.com/Sex-pistols-god-save-the-queen-lyrics|title=Sex&amp;nbsp;Pistols – God Save The Queen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Oi! became a recognised genre in the latter part of the 1970s, emerging after the perceived commercialisation of [[punk rock]], and before the soon-to-dominate [[hardcore punk]] sound. It fused the sounds of early punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]], the [[Ramones]], [[The Clash]], and [[The Jam]] with influences from 1960s British rock bands such as the [[Small Faces]], and [[The Who]], [[football chant]]s, [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] bands such as [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]], and [[The 101ers]], and [[glam rock]] bands such as [[Slade]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Although Oi! has come to be considered mainly a skinhead-orientated genre, the first Oi! bands were composed mostly of punk rockers and people who fit neither the skinhead nor punk label.

First-generation Oi! bands such as [[Sham 69]] and [[Cock Sparrer]] were around for years before the word ''Oi!'' was used retrospectively to describe their style of music. In 1980, writing in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine, rock journalist [[Garry Bushell]] labelled the movement ''Oi!'', taking the name from the garbled "[[Oi (interjection)|Oi]]!" that Stinky Turner of [[Cockney Rejects]] used to introduce the band's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://punkmodpop.free.fr/cockneyrejects_pic.htm |title=Cockney Rejects: History and Pictures / Oi Music / Punk Rock |publisher=Punkmodpop.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828055640/http://punkmodpop.free.fr/cockneyrejects_pic.htm |archivedate=2009-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Bushell, Hoolies: True Stories of Britain’s Biggest Street Battles (London, 2010), 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an old [[British English|British]] expression meaning ''hey'' or ''hey there!'' In addition to Cockney Rejects, other bands to be explicitly labeled Oi! in the early days of the genre included [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[The 4-Skins]], [[The Business (band)|The Business]], [[Anti-Establishment (band)|Anti-Establishment]], [[Blitz (band)|Blitz]], [[The Blood]], and [[Combat 84]].&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, George (1991). ''Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible'' (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing). {{ISBN|1-898927-10-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent ideology of the original Oi! movement was a rough brand of working-class rebellion. Lyrical topics included unemployment, workers' rights, harassment by police and other authorities, and oppression by the government.&lt;ref name="Robb_history"/&gt; Oi! songs also covered less-political topics such as street violence, football, sex, and alcohol.

Some fans of Oi! were involved in [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] organisations such as the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) and the [[British Movement]] (BM), leading some critics to dismiss the Oi! subgenre as [[racism|racist]].&lt;ref name="Robb_history"/&gt; However, none of the bands associated with the original Oi! scene promoted racism or [[far-right politics]]. Some Oi! bands, such as Angelic Upstarts, The Business, [[The Burial]] and [[The Oppressed]] were associated with [[left wing politics]] and [[anti-racism]], and others were non-political.&lt;ref name="truth_garry"&gt;{{cite web|author= Bushell, Garry|url=http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |title=Oi!—The Truth|publisher=garry-bushell.co.uk|date= |accessdate=2010-11-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731120915/http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |archivedate = 2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full Worley, Matthew, ''Oi!

[[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) was a partial development from [[white power]]/[[white supremacist]] movements, which had musical and aesthetic similarities to Oi! Although due to Cold War fears the genre had appeal to some punk rock bands distinct from original Oi! in that they opposed all [[totalitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Barberis, Peter, John McHugh, and Mike Tyldesley (2000). ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'' (London and New York: Continuum International Publishing Group), p. 175. {{ISBN|0-8264-5814-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not connected to the Oi! scene. Timothy S. Brown writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Oi!] played an important symbolic role in the politicization of the skinhead subculture. By providing, for the first time, a musical focus for skinhead identity that was 'white'—that is, that had nothing to do with the West Indian immigrant presence and little obvious connection with black musical roots—Oi! provided a musical focus for new visions of skinhead identity [and] a point of entry for a new brand of right-wing rock music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Brown, Timothy S.|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_38/ai_n6234788/pg_6/?tag=content;col1|title=Subcultures, Pop Music and Politics: Skinheads and 'Nazi Rock' in England and Germany|work=Journal of Social History|date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Garry Bushell, the journalist who promoted the Oi! genre, argued that the white power music scene was "totally distinct from us. We had no overlap other than a mutual dislike".&lt;ref name=Petridis/&gt;

The mainstream media increased its claims that Oi! was linked to far-right racist politics after an Oi! concert at the Hambrough Tavern in [[Southall]] on 4 July 1981 ended with five hours of rioting, 120 people being injured and the tavern being burnt down.&lt;ref name=riot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, George (1991). ''Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible'' (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing), pp. 106, 110. {{ISBN|1-898927-10-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Renton, ''When We Touched the Sky: The Anti-Nazi League, 1977–81'' (London, 2006), 136–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the concert, some audience members had written NF slogans around the area and bullied Asian residents of the neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Robb_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name=riot&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&amp;dat=19810705&amp;id=t1YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6426,404910|title=Race Riot Strikes London|date=5 July 1981|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, local Asian youths threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at the tavern, mistakenly believing that the concert—featuring The Business, The 4-Skins and The Last Resort—was a neo-Nazi event. Although some of the concert-goers were NF or BM supporters, none of the performers were [[white power music]] bands, and the audience of approximately 500 people included left-wing skinheads, black skinheads, punk rockers, [[rockabilly|rockabillies]] and non-affiliated youths.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, George (1991). ''Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible'' (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing), pp. 107–108. {{ISBN|1-898927-10-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of that riot, many Oi! bands condemned racism and [[fascism]]. These denials, however, were met with cynicism from some quarters because of the ''[[Strength Thru Oi!]]'' compilation album, released in May 1981. Not only was its title a play on a [[Nazism|Nazi]] slogan "[[Strength Through Joy]]", but the cover featured [[Nicky Crane]], a skinhead BM activist who was serving a four-year sentence for racist violence (Crane later disavowed his alignment with the far right after revealing he was gay).&lt;ref name="BBC_News_ Nicky_Crane_The_secret_double_life_of_a_gay_neo-Nazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25142557|title=Nicky Crane: The secret double life of a gay neo-Nazi|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bushell, who compiled the album, insists its title was a pun on [[The Skids]]' album [[The Absolute Game#Strength Through Joy|''Strength Through Joy'']], and that he had been unaware of the Nazi connotations.&lt;ref name="truth_garry"/&gt; He also denied knowing the identity of the skinhead on the album's cover until it was exposed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' two months after the release.&lt;ref name="truth_garry"/&gt; Bushell, a socialist at the time, noted the irony of being branded a far-right activist by a newspaper that "had once supported [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]], Mussolini's [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion of Abyssinia]], and appeasement with Hitler right up to the outbreak of World War Two."&lt;ref name="truth_garry"/&gt;

After the Oi! movement lost momentum in the United Kingdom, Oi! scenes formed in continental Europe, North America, and Asia. Soon, especially in the United States, the Oi! phenomenon mirrored the hardcore punk scene of the late 1970s, with American Oi!-originating bands such as The Radicals, [[U.S. Chaos]], [[Iron Cross (band)|Iron Cross]], [[Agnostic Front]], Anti Heros. Later American punk bands such as [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Dropkick Murphys]] have credited Oi! as a source of inspiration.&lt;ref name=Petridis&gt;{{cite web|author= Petridis, Alexis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/18/oi-cockney-rejects-garry-bushell-interview|title=Misunderstood or hateful? Oi!'s rise and fall|work=Guardian|date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, there was a revival of interest in Oi! music in the UK, leading to older Oi! bands receiving more recognition {{citation needed|reason=I think it needs reliable source for that|date=January 2016}}. In the 2000s, many of the original UK Oi! bands reunited to perform and/or record.

The '''opening narration''' of a story, whether [[video game]], [[book]], [[film]] or otherwise, usually gives the reader or viewer background information necessary for a full understanding of the plot. It sets the scene, creates atmosphere and introduces a character.

Gervais worked initially in the music industry, attempting a career as a pop star in the 1980s as the singer of the [[new wave music|new wave]] act [[Seona Dancing]] and working as the manager of the then-unknown band [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before turning to comedy. Gervais appeared on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' on Channel 4 between 1998 and 2000. In 2000, he was given a [[Channel 4]] talk show, ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]'', and then achieved greater mainstream fame a year later with his BBC television series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. It was followed by ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' in 2005. He co-wrote and co-directed both series with [[Stephen Merchant]]. In addition to writing and directing the shows, he played the lead roles of [[David Brent]] in ''The Office'' and [[Andy Millman]] in ''Extras''. He reprised his role as Brent in the comedy film ''[[David Brent: Life on the Road]]''. 

Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. He has performed five multi-national stand-up comedy tours, and wrote the ''[[Flanimals]]'' book series. Gervais, Merchant and [[Karl Pilkington]] created the [[podcast]], ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'', which has spawned various spin-offs starring Pilkington and produced by Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1703591,00.html|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=John|last=Plunkett|date=6 February 2006|accessdate=27 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also starred in the Hollywood films ''[[Ghost Town (2008 film)|Ghost Town]]'', and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', and wrote, directed and starred in ''[[The Invention of Lying]]'' and the [[Netflix]] released ''[[Special Correspondents]]''. He hosted the [[Golden Globe Awards]] in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016, and appears on the game show ''[[Child Support (U.S. game show)|Child Support]]''.

Gervais has won seven [[BAFTA Awards]], five [[British Comedy Awards]], two [[Emmy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]] and the 2006 [[Rose d'Or]], as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, he was named the third most influential person in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPod designer voted UK's most influential cultural icon|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/12/ipod_designer_voted_uks_most/|agency=The Register|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was voted the 11th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/|title=Episode 1.1 The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007|publisher=Comedy.co.uk|accessdate =25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the updated 2010 list as the 3rd greatest stand-up comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/|title=Episode 1.2 The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2010|publisher=Comedy.co.uk|accessdate =25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was named on the ''[[Time 100]]'' list of the world's most influential people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2058044_2060338_2060076,00.html|title=Ricky Gervais The 2010 Time 100 Poll|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gervais was born at [[Battle Hospital]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. He was raised in [[Whitley, Berkshire|Whitley]], along with brother Larry (born 1945), sister Marsha (born 1948), and brother Robert (born 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ricky-gervais-a-lucky-man-lurks-behind-david-brent--but-just-who-is-he-611664.html |title=Ricky Gervais: A lucky man lurks behind David Brent – but just who is he? |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |date=21 December 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |first=Robert |last=Hanks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905174339/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ricky-gervais-a-lucky-man-lurks-behind-david-brent--but-just-who-is-he-611664.html |archivedate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Lawrence Raymond "Jerry" Gervais (1919–2002), a [[Franco-Ontarian]] from [[Pain Court, Ontario]], emigrated to the UK whilst on foreign duty during the [[Second World War]] and worked as a labourer and hod carrier.&lt;ref name="telegraphuk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/8722858/Ricky-Gervais-Dont-ask-me-the-price-of-milk-I-fly-by-private-jet.html |title=Ricky Gervais: Don’t ask me the price of milk - I fly by private jet |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 August 2011 |first=Bryony |last=Gordon |accessdate=28 August 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met Gervais' mother, Eva Sophia (''née'' House; 1925–2000),&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/you-asked-for-it-ricky-ge_b_531001.html|title=You Asked for It, Ricky Gervais!|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=8 April 2010|first=Megan|last=Smolenyak|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[English people|English]], during a [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]; they settled in Whitley.

He attended Whitley Park Infants and Junior Schools, and received his secondary education at Ashmead Comprehensive School; after a spell as a gardener at the [[University of Reading]], he moved on to [[University College London]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heatley|2006|pages=23, 28}}{{clarify|reason=no matching full citation;|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francesca Perryman |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/happy-birthday-ricky-gervais-plus-11516111 |title=Happy Birthday Ricky Gervais!

==Career==

===Music===
In 1983, during his final year as a student at UCL (University College London), Gervais and college friend [[Bill Macrae]] formed the [[New wave music|new wave]] pop [[Musical ensemble|duo]], [[Seona Dancing]]. They were signed by [[London Records]], which released two of their singles—"[[More to Lose]]" and "[[Bitter Heart (song)|Bitter Heart]]". The songs failed to chart inside the UK top 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the [[Philippines]] with "More to Lose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/26/ricky_gervais_pop_band/|title=Ricky Gervais' career as an 80's glam-pop star|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as the manager for [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before they became successful in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a321491/brett-anderson-praises-ex-manager-ricky-gervais.html#~p2t6TtO7XcwBvE|title=Brent Anderson Praises Ex-manager Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as [[David Brent]] along with a band under the name "Foregone Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such as "Equality Street" and "[[Free Love Freeway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/73215 |title=Ricky Gervais plays debut David Brent show with former Razorlight star in London |work=[[NME]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos under the title 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

In 2016, as part of the ''Life on Road'' film promotion, Gervais published the ''David Brent Songbook'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01HBPUIC6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 |title=David Brent Songbook eBook: David Brent: Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing 15 songs. These were also recorded for the album ''Life on the Road'', under the name of David Brent and Foregone Conclusion.

===Radio===
Gervais worked as an [[event management|assistant events manager]] for the [[University of London Union]] (ULU), then moved from ULU to a job as head of speech at the alternative radio station [[XFM|Xfm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/comedy/2010/12/ricky-gervais-ince-office|title=Ricky Gervais: They Call Me Entertainment|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needing an assistant, Gervais interviewed the first person whose ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' he saw. It belonged to [[Stephen Merchant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/arts/television/14gervais.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Three Mates Laughing (Well, Two Are) |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2015|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Gervais was made [[Layoff|redundant]] when the station was taken over by the [[Capital Radio]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|title=XFM &amp; The Podfather: Ricky Gervais Week|work=City of Film|first=Graham|last=McMorrow|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121193147/http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|archivedate=21 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was also a regular contributor to [[Mary Anne Hobbs]]' Radio 1 show, performing vox pop interviews in unlikely locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Worthington |first=Tim |date=2012 |title=Fun At One: The Story Of Comedy At BBC Radio 1 |url= |location= |publisher=Lulu Press |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first series of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', Gervais and Merchant returned to [[Xfm]] in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show. This was when the pair first worked with [[Karl Pilkington]], who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/5930/ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchant-return-to-xfm|title=Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Return to Xfm|work=Gigwise |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show ''Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius'' on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Ricky Gervais on New SiriusXM Talk Show: They ‘Made Me an Offer I Couldn’t Refuse’|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ricky-gervais-siriusxm-comedy-talk-show-1202593641/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Podcast====
{{See also|The Ricky Gervais Show|List of The Ricky Gervais Show episodes}}
On 5 December 2005, ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' began offering free weekly [[podcast]]s, including ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' featuring Gervais, Merchant, and [[Karl Pilkington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4479230.stm|title=Gervais radio show to be podcast |date= 28 November 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout January and February 2006 the podcast was consistently ranked the number-one podcast in the world; it appeared in the 2007 [[Guinness World Record]] for the world's most-downloaded podcast, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/06/radio.newmedia|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more series—each with six podcasts—were released between February and September 2006.

In late 2006, three more free podcasts were released. Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Podfather-Trilogy-Season-Gervais/dp/B002SPXUZC|title=The Podfather Trilogy|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three were known by Ricky and Steve as "The Fourth Season". In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes; this podcast was originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais' ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'' stand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free full-length podcast, which lasted just over an hour.

In August 2008, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth season of [[audiobook]]s, totaling 4 chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008. These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 "Guides" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law &amp; Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.

===Television===

====Early television appearances====
[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]
Gervais has contributed to the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavare]] Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais
|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

====''The Office''====
{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}
''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from [[Ash Atalla]], who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus [[David Brent]] was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], who then passed it on to Head of Comedy [[Jon Plowman]], who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais

The first six-episode series of ''The Office'' aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/people/ricky-gervais/AA3l0x9|title=Ricky Gervais| publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Office''{{'s}} second series, Gervais was named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful person in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|title=Gervais crowned 'king of comedy'|date=6 January 2003|publisher=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRevTA3J?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|archivedate=13 September 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''The Office'' won the [[Golden Globe]]s for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Husam sam Asi|title=What does Ricky Gervais really think of the Golden Globes? - Interview|date=16 January 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbPlRseDPU|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Office]]'' brand has since been remade for audiences in [[:sv:Kontoret|Sweden]], [[Le Bureau|France]], [[Stromberg (TV series)|Germany]], [[La Job|Quebec]], [[Os Aspones|Brazil]] and the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|publisher=Splitsider.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode "[[The Convict]]" for the show's third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4687784.stm|title=Gervais writing US Office episode|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais has said that the episode "[[Episode Four (The Office, Series One)|Training]]" is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings.

====''Extras''====
{{Main|Extras (TV series)}}
[[Extras (TV series)|''Extras'']] had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a [[Extra (actor)|background artist]]. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais' ''The Office'' character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of ''Extras'' include [[Ross Kemp]], [[Les Dennis]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Francesca Martinez]]. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Diana Rigg|Dame Diana Rigg]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Patricia Potter]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Moira Stuart]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/28/lastnightstvextras |title=Extras attacked celebrity - with a little help from George Michael, David Tennant et al|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JonathanRossRickyGervais.jpg|thumb|Gervais (right) with [[Jonathan Ross]] at [[Live 8]] in July 2005]]
A Christmas special of ''Extras'' aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by [[George Michael]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], Jonathan Ross and [[David Tennant]].

Gervais was influenced by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in making ''Extras'', particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936|title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Gervais won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series of ''Extras''. As Gervais was not present at the awards ceremony, the trophy was accepted on his behalf by [[Steve Carell]], the actor who starred as regional manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] – the counterpart to Gervais' David Brent – on [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation of ''The Office'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/lat-accep-carel_johsi3nc20090817152500-photo.html |title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell accept Ricky Gervais' Emmy |publisher=LA Times |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with ''Extras'', "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of ''The Office'', but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and Darren ([[Stephen Merchant]]), and the apparent parody of this style with ''When The Whistle Blows'', and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely [[stereotype]]d gay couple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky|title=Extras work needed, Ricky?|first=Chris |last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show stars actor Davis playing a fictionalized version of himself, as well as Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/24/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short|title=Ricky Gervais plans Life's Too Short film|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ben|last=Child|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium cable channel [[HBO]], who co-produced the series with the BBC, had the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Ricky-Gervais-Steven-Merchant-Warwick-Davis-Tease-Life-Too-Short-36112.html|title=Ricky Gervais, Steven Merchant, And Warwick Davis Tease Life's Too Short|publisher=Cinemablend.com|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a326379/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short-heads-for-hbo.html |title=Ricky Gervais 'Life's Too Short' heads for HBO – US TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''An Idiot Abroad''====
{{Main|An Idiot Abroad}}
''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington travels around the world, while his reactions to people and places is recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call him to surprise him with a new place to visit or a task to do. Pilkington reports back to them and mostly complains about the situation he is in. Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11326209|title=Ricky Gervais says show with Karl Pilkington is real|publisher=BBC|accessdate =6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date two series and a Christmas special have aired, series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders of the World, in the second show he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais and in the special Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo's route from Italy to China.

====''Derek''====
{{Main|Derek (TV series)}}
In November 2011, Gervais filmed in London a 35-minute pilot episode for a potential [[comedy-drama]] series called ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] on 12 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plumplard.com |date=August 2004 |url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthe.php |title=Ricky Gervais...

British comedian [[Kerry Godliman]] plays Derek's best friend Hannah and David Earl plays Kev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derek/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 |title=Derek |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added "It's about the forgotten – everyone's forgotten. It's all these arbitrary people who didn't know each other, and they're in there now because they're in the last years of their life. And it's about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It's about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they're together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched ''[[Secret Millionaire]]'' – "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now."&lt;ref name=independentderek&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|title='Mock the disabled?

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s; his first successful show took place at the [[Cafe Royal]], as part of the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Titled ''Rubbernecker'', the show also featured [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stephen Merchant]].

Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show ''[[Animals (comedy)|Animals]]''. The ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]'' tour followed a year later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'', took place in 2007. It started in [[Glasgow]] in January and ended in [[Sheffield]] in April. [[Blackpool]] reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/13/4816/what_a_sell-out|title=What a sell-out, Huge demand for Gervais tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsnight Review]]'''s panel saw ''Animals'' during its [[UCL Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury]] run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] saying it was "cobbled together...banal...a bit flat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=BBC News, 13&amp;nbsp;January 2003 | date=13 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a179513/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-ricky-gervais.html|title=Ten Things You Never Knew About Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Alex |last=Fletcher|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=Newsnight Review discussed Ricky Gervais one man show Animals at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fame'' was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, referring to [[Ipswich serial murders|the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gervais apologetic over 'killing' joke|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/gervais_apologetic_over_killing_joke_1_112739|website=Ipswich Star|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand up show will be called ''Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-01-17/ricky-gervais-returning-to-stand-up-comedy-i-think-it-will-be-my-angriest-yet|title=Ricky Gervais returning to stand-up comedy: "I think it will be my angriest yet"|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, he said he was too busy to do his tour due to producing two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-08/ricky-gervais-why-my-humanity-live-stand-up-tour-is-on-hold-for-now|title=Ricky Gervais Why My Humanity Live Stand Uo Tour is On Hold for Now|work=Radio Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Gervais was back doing stand up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast members from ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-03-29/ricky-gervais-is-performing-stand-up-gigs-in-london-this-may|title=Ricky Gervais is performing stand up gigs in London this May|work=Radiotimes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Finally, I'm going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years if you don't count hosting the [[Golden Globes]]."

He continued his ''Humanity'' show throughout 2017 and into 2018; appearing at [[SF Sketchfest]] as part of the tour, which devoted a night in honor of the comedian, alongside comedic legend and mentor [[Christopher Guest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Gervais to appear at SF Sketchfest before taking on ‘Humanity’|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/performance/article/Ricky-Gervais-to-appear-at-SF-Sketchfest-before-12473686.php|website=SF Chronicle|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next tour and [[Netflix]] special was announced in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/04/20/39738/ricky_gervais_announces_his_first_supernature_gigs|title=Ricky Gervais announces his first SuperNature gigs : News 2018 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|website=www.chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in [[Robbie the Reindeer]]'s ''Legend of the Lost Tribe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/n2kph/robbie-the-reindeer-in-legend-of-the-lost-tribe|title=Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe|work=Radio Times|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]". He is the only British comic to write and star in a ''Simpsons'' episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed and Confused]]'' magazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a ''Simpsons'' script. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: "I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watch ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' at the moment, we watch ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...]]'' we watch all those reality TV shows&amp;nbsp;– ''The Office'' came out of those docu-soaps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=3&amp;ObjectID=1665&amp;CityID=3|title= Interview at UKULA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais, a longstanding ''Simpsons'' fan, presented a segment to mark the show's 20th anniversary on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on 16 June 2007.

In 2012, Gervais made a guest appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'' in the episode titled "[[Be Careful What You Fish For]]". In the episode, Gervais plays a dolphin named Billy Finn who gives [[Peter Griffin]] a [[Mercedes-Benz]] hood ornament, Peter half-heartedly promises a favor to him. Soon, Billy moves to Quahog but outstays his welcome at Peter's. Peter tries to reunite Billy with his ex-wife in hopes that he will return to the ocean. The episode also featured [[Lucy Davis]]. Both Gervais and Davis starred together in ''The Office''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Be Careful What You Fish For|url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/be-careful-what-you-fish-for,69550/|work= The A.V Club|last= MacFarland|first= Kevin|date= 20 February 2012|accessdate= 15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guest star on television series====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7252">The '''seclusion of girls at puberty''' has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to [[Culture and menstruation|menstruation]], the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of [[ritual purification]] related to the sacred power of blood.&lt;ref name=benedict &gt;{{cite book|author = Benedict, Ruth|year = 2002|title = Cultural Sociology|editor=Spillman, Lyn|chapter= The Diversity of Cultures|page = 22|publisher  = Blackwell Publishers Ltd|isbn= 0-631-21652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These societies practised various [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=Broude20051 &gt;{{cite book|author= Broude, Ruth|year = 2005|title= The Birkshire Encyclopedia of World History|editor1-first=W. H.|editor1-last=McNeill|editor2-first=Jerry H.|editor2-last=Bentley|url = http://BerkshireWorldHistory.com|chapter= Initiation and Rites of Passage|publisher = Berkshire Publishing Group|isbn= 0-9743091-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites==
[[File:Venus figurine cave of Laussel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Venus of Laussel]]]]
Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to [[Sir James George Frazer]], these rules also applied to [[divine king]]s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelureofnoma.com/?p=131|title=Seclusion of Girls – Evidence from Paleolithic Times?|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}} are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their [[adiposity]] (caused by seclusion).

Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:
* Once a girl from [[Zulu people|Zulu tribes]] in [[South Africa]] showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;{{cite book|author= Frazer, James|year = 1993|title = The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|chapter= Between Heaven and Earth|publisher  = Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn= 1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and in the Kabadi District of [[New Guinea]], pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
*In many societies, including [[Brahmin]]s of [[Bengal]], girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[California]] did not allow girls in their first menstruation to "look about". 
*Among the [[Tiyan]]s of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch "any other person, tree or plant".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
* Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she "is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power"&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|author= Lincoln, Bruce|year = 1981|title = Emerging from the Chrysalis: Studies in Rituals of Women's Initiation|publisher  = Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-24840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–52}}
Frazer believed that the Greek myth of [[Danaë]], who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by [[Zeus]], was related to girls' puberty rites.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;{{rp|602}} Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as "being in the underworld".&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Reasons for the seclusion==

===Preparation for womanhood===
Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.&lt;ref name=Broude20051 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker1905 &gt;{{cite book|author= Langloh Parker,  Katherine|authorlink=K. Langloh Parker |year = 1905|title= [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe|The Euahlayi Tribe]]: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia|chapter = [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe/Chapter 7#56|Birth—Betrothal—An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood]]|page=56-58|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstition===
Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the "deeply engrained dread" of "menstruous blood". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.

Among the [[Apache Indians]], "the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing".&lt;ref name=benedict /&gt; A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of "a degree of supernatural power" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the "power of evil".

The [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men "fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|606}}--&gt;

In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.&lt;ref name=Arachige2009 &gt;{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

'''Self-insertion''' is a literary device in which a [[fictional character]], who represents the real author of a work of fiction, appears as an idealized character within that fiction, either overtly or in disguise.&lt;ref name="Goetz2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goetz|first=Sharon K.|title=Terminus: Collected Papers on Harry Potter, 7-11 August 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nffbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA516|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780982680704|pages=516–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the equivalent is the '''inserted self-portrait''', where the artist includes a [[self-portrait]] in a painting of a narrative subject. This has been a common artistic device since at least the [[European Renaissance]].

==Related concepts==
This literary device should not be confused with a [[first-person narrator]], an [[author surrogate]], or a character somewhat based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as ''unintentional'' self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''Sign languages''' (also known as '''signed languages''') are [[language]]s that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Language is expressed via the manual signstream in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with "[[body language]]", a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].

Wherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as children of deaf adults ([[Child of deaf adult|CODAs]]).

It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 137 sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

''Sign Language Legislation in the European Union - Edition II''. European Union of the Deaf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, [[home sign]], "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.

== History ==
{{Main|History of sign language}}
[[Image:Arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos.jpg|thumb|Juan Pablo Bonet, {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} ("Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak") (Madrid, 1620)]]

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"&lt;ref name="bauman2008"&gt;{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=0-8166-4619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de León]] (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} (‘Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak’) in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar á ablar los Mudos''. Ed. Abarca de Angulo, Madrid, ejemplar facsímil accesible en la {{cite web |url=http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172251/http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}, online (spanish) scan of book, held at University of Sevilla, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics, setting out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet.

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644]]
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, John (1641). ''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of "secret discoursing, by signes and gestures".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: "Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z." (1641:116-117)&lt;/ref&gt; public speaking, or communication by deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;John Bulwer's "Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',&lt;ref&gt;Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;&lt;ref&gt;See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.&lt;/ref&gt; some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, G. "The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. "Historical Aspects of Manual Communication" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.&lt;br /&gt;
and Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe (1720). "The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

Frenchman [[Abbé de l'Épée|Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called [[Gallaudet University]], it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

{{Anchor| not speech based}} Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand all have English as their dominant language, but [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from [[French Sign Language]] whereas the other three countries sign dialects of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |title=Ethnologue report for language code: bfi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009095734/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Spanish Sign Language survey |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020141343/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in a Spanish-speaking country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Bolivia deaf community and sign language pre-survey report |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024309/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which don't necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucas, Ceil]], Robert Bayley and [[Clayton Valli]]. 2001.

[[International Sign]], formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and meetings of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]]. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a [[pidgin]], they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Supalla, Ted &amp; Rebecca Webb (1995). "The grammar of international sign: A new look at pidgin languages." In: Emmorey, Karen &amp; Judy Reilly (eds). ''Language, gesture, and space.''

"Interpreting in International Sign Pidgin: an analysis." ''Journal of Sign Language Linguistics'' 5(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
While the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as '''Gestuno''',&lt;ref&gt;Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J. (1975). ''Gestuno. International sign language of the deaf.'' Carlisle: British Deaf Association.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''International Sign Pidgin'''&lt;ref&gt;McKee R., Napier J.

Van Cleve (ed.), "Gallaudet encyclopedia of deaf people and deafness", Vol 3 S-Z, Index. NewYork: McGraw-Hill Book Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; International Sign is a term used by the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] and other international organisations.

== Linguistics ==
In linguistic terms, sign languages are as rich and complex as any spoken language, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages". Professional [[linguistics|linguists]] have studied many sign languages and found that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Klima|Klima, Edward S.]]; &amp; [[Ursula Bellugi|Bellugi, Ursula]]. (1979). ''The signs of language''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-80795-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sandler, Wendy; &amp; Lillo-Martin, Diane. (2006). Sign Language and Linguistic Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign languages are not [[mime]]—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not [[onomatopoeic]]. While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Taub (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s (from the Greek word for "hand") in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s (from Greek for "voice") of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].
&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross (2016).

In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science. Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the [[Hockett's design features|characteristics]] that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, [[semanticity]], [[arbitrariness]], [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], and [[Traditional transmission|cultural transmission]].

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], a high degree of [[inflection]] by means of changes of movement, and a [[Topic-comment language|topic-comment]] [[syntax]]. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information".&lt;ref&gt;Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category "sign languages" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,&lt;ref&gt;p. 970-972. ''Linguistic Bibliography for the Year 1988''. Leiden, Netherlands:Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; when it appeared with 39 entries.

Always there is a common misconception that sign languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: that they are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlmutter|first=David M.|title=What is Sign Language?|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|work=LSA|accessdate=4 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412004710/http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities in [[Sign language in the brain|language processing in the brain]] between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.

On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|"Hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of "hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[American Sign Language grammar#Numeral incorporation and classifiers|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===
Sign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012688117|title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing|last=|first=|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=Quer, Josep, Carlo Cecchetto &amp; Caterina Donati et al. (eds.)|year=2017|isbn=9781501511806|location=|pages=|oclc=1012688117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross &amp; Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boudreault|first=Patrick|author2=Mayberry, Rachel I.|year=2006|title=Grammatical processing in American Sign Language: Age of first-language acquisition effects in relation to syntactic structure|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=21|issue=5|pages=608–635|doi=10.1080/01690960500139363}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.&lt;ref name="Baker&amp;Cokely"&gt;Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll"&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and Bencie Woll (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means 'carelessly', but a similar non-manual in BSL means 'boring' or 'unpleasant'.&lt;ref name=Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll /&gt;

Discourse functions such as [[conversation analysis|turn taking]] are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Charlotte (1977). Regulators and turn-taking in American Sign Language discourse, in Lynn Friedman, ''On the other hand: New perspectives on American Sign Language.'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconicity ===
The first studies on [[iconicity]] in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klima &amp; Bellugi (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. "The Signs of Language." Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane. "Introduction." Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.

Some researchers have suggested that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to document this benefit. In his study, Brown found that when children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than when they were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or "English on the hands." One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.

The [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"&gt;Taub (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation ("[[construal]]" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"&gt;Wilcox (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for "ask" has parts of its form that are iconic ("movement away from the mouth" means "something coming from the mouth"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"&gt;Meir (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as "double mapped".&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"/&gt;

Although sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.

A [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&amp;nbsp;– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the "gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1987). See also the classification of [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1991) for the general issue of jargons as prototypes in sign language genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao sign language 025.jpg|thumb|Young students learn some words of [[Lao sign language]] from Suliphone, a deaf artist. This was one of several activities at a school book party sponsored by Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in [[Laos]] where Suliphone works.]]
* [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Auslan]] and [[NZSL]] are usually considered to be a language known as [[BANZSL]]. [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[South African Sign Language]] are also related to BSL.&lt;ref&gt;See Gordon (2008), under nsr {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014547/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }} and sfs {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104537/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Sign Language]] and its descendants [[Norwegian Sign Language]] and [[Icelandic Sign Language]] are largely mutually intelligible with [[Swedish Sign Language]]. [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Portuguese Sign Language]] derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to [[British Sign Language]].
* [[Indian Sign Language]] ISL is similar to [[Pakistani Sign Language]]. (ISL fingerspelling uses both hands, similarly to British Sign Language.).
* [[Japanese Sign Language]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and [[Korean Sign Language]] are thought to be members of a [[Japanese Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Susan D. ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 499.|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Sign Language family]]. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].
* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.
* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.
* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a "cluster" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.
* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].
* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's classification went into [[Ethnologue]]'s database where it is still cited.{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072840/http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }} The subsequent edition of Ethnologue in 1992 went up to 81 sign languages, ultimately adopting Wittmann's distinction between primary and alternate sign languages (going back ultimately to Stokoe 1974) and, more vaguely, some other traits from his analysis. The 2013 version (17th edition) of [[Ethnologue]] is now up to 137 sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann adds that this taxonomic criterion is not really applicable with any scientific rigor: Auxiliary sign languages, to the extent that they are full-fledged natural languages (and therefore included in his survey) at all, are mostly used by the deaf as well, and some primary sign languages (such as ASL and [[Adamorobe Sign Language]]) have acquired auxiliary usages.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann includes in this class [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] (at least 14 different languages), [[Monastic sign language]], Thai Hill-Country sign languages (possibly including languages in Vietnam and Laos), and [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (14 deaf schools with different sign languages).&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language.&lt;ref name=pro-A&gt;These are [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Armenian Sign Language]], [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]], Hindu [[mudra]], the [[Monastic sign languages]], [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], [[Urubú-Kaapor Sign Language]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Japanese Sign Language]], and maybe the various [[Thai Hill-Country sign languages]], [[French Sign Language]], [[Lyons Sign Language]], and [[Mayan sign languages|Nohya Maya Sign Language]]. Wittmann also includes, bizarrely, Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;/ref&gt; Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called "[[stimulus diffusion]]".&lt;ref name=pro-R&gt;These are [[Providencia Island Sign Language|Providencia Island]], [[Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia]] (manually signed Malay), [[German Sign Language|German]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language|Ecuadoran]], [[Salvadoran Sign Language|Salvadoran]], [[Gestuno]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language|Indo-Pakistani]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Kenyan Sign Language|Kenyan]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian]], [[Spanish Sign Language|Spanish]], [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] (with possible admixture), [[Penang Sign Language|Penang]], [[Rennellese Sign Language|Rennellese]], [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi]], the various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]], and perhaps BSL, [[Peruvian Sign Language|Peruvian]], [[Tijuana Sign Language|Tijuana]] (spurious), [[Venezuelan Sign Language|Venezuelan]], and [[Nicaraguan Sign Language|Nicaraguan]] sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The families of [[BANZSL|BSL]], [[German Sign Language|DGS]], [[Japanese Sign Language|JSL]], [[French Sign Language|LSF]] (and possibly [[Lyons Sign Language|LSG]]) were the products of [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] of prototype languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's references on the subject, besides his own work on [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] in spoken languages, include papers such as Fischer (1974, 1978), Deuchar (1987) and Judy Kegl's pre-1991 work on creolization in sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's explanation for this is that models of acquisition and transmission for sign languages are not based on any typical parent-child relation model of direct transmission which is inducive to variation and change to a greater extent. He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typology ===
{{See also|Linguistic typology}}

Linguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35–36; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Zeshan, Cesar Ernesto Escobedo Delgado, Hasan Dikyuva, Sibaji Panda, and Connie de Vos. 2013. Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology. Linguistic Typology 17: 357–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
{{See also|Language acquisition}}

Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the plasticity of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=|website=ACFOS|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262–290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Written forms ===
{{anchor|Notation}}&lt;!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here --&gt;
Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jason | year = 2008 | title = Choosing how to write sign language: a sociolinguistic perspective | url = | journal = [[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]] | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 75–90 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* [[Stokoe notation]], devised by Dr. [[William Stokoe]] for his 1965 ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'',&lt;ref name="StokoeWilliam"&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].
* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.
* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language.  Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting "is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system."&lt;ref name="GaleaLinguistic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, [[American Sign Language|sign]] [[Categorical perception|perception]] influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development.  The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142013/http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = P | year = 1991 | title = Human adults and human infants show a 'perceptual magnet effect' for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 93–107 | doi=10.3758/bf03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morford | first1 = J.

The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.

=== Deaf communities and deaf culture ===
{{Main|Deaf culture}}

When Deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, Deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These Deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the Deaf community is [[Black ASL]]. This sign language was developed in the Black Deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young Black Deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white Deaf peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaskill, C. (2011). The hidden treasure of Black ASL: its history and structure. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a "village sign language"&lt;ref name="ZeshanDeVos2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this happens in small, tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool. Famous examples include:
* [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[United States]]
* [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]], [[Israel]]
* [[Kata Kolok]], [[Bali]]
* [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Ghana]] 
* [[Mayan Sign Language#Yucatec Mayan Sign Language|Yucatec Maya Sign Language]], [[Mexico]] 
In such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, 
so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate "Deaf" community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003" /&gt;

Many [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the [[Warlpiri Sign Language|Warlpiri]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]], [[Dieri]], [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], and [[Warlmanpa language|Warlmanpa]], and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A [[pidgin]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=What is the evidence that it was a pidgin?}} sign language arose among tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Great Plains]] region of [[North America]] (see [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]). It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.
In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Signs may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.

=== Legal recognition ===
{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}
Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A deaf person using a remote VRS interpreter to communicate with a hearing person]]

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&amp;nbsp;– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"&gt;Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&amp;T Picturephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 &amp; 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969;&lt;/ref&gt; However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a [[video link]], either with a special-purpose [[videophone]] designed for use with sign language or with "off-the-shelf" [[videotelephony|video services]] designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer [[webcam]].  The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|special videophones]] that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

=== Interpretation ===
{{Main|Language interpretation#Sign language}}
[[File:2017 Woodstock 022 Język migowy.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Sign Language]] interpreter at the [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2017]]
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used.  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent [[deep learning]] based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Huang | first=Jie | last2=Zhou | first2=Wengang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Li | first4=Houqiang | last5=Li | first5=Weiping | title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation | website=arXiv.org e-Print archive | date=2018-01-30 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | archivedate=2018-03-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote interpreting ===
&lt;!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]
but has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.
 --&gt;
[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|175px|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

=== Interpretation on television ===
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]

Sign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.

[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | publisher= | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | pages= | accessdate=2008-01-30 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.&lt;ref name="RNID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed. Some emerging [[television]] technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to [[subtitles]] and [[closed captioning]].&lt;ref name="RNID"/&gt;

Legal requirements covering sign language on television vary from country to country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Broadcasting Act 1996]] addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |title=ITC Guidelines on Standards for Sign Language on Digital Terrestrial Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423180334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been replaced by the [[Communications Act 2003]].

=== Language endangerment ===
As with any spoken language, sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming [[Endangered languages|endangered]]. For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users [[Language shift|shift]] to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|title=Did you know Hawai'i Sign Language is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065744/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195139778|language=en|quote=The language is considered to be endangered. 9,600 deaf people in Hawaii now use American Sign Language with a few local signs for place-names and cultural items.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
{{Main|Manually coded language}}

When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== "Baby sign language" with hearing children ===
{{Main|Baby sign language}}

It has become popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL or some other sign language) to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a beneficial option for better communication.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.  This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants.  When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
{{Main|Home sign}}

Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes "home sign" or "kitchen sign").&lt;ref&gt;Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow &amp; Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.&lt;ref&gt;The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard.

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
{{Main|Origin of language#Gestural theory|l1=Origin of language § Gestural theory}}

One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes (1973), Premack &amp; Premack (1983), Kimura (1993), Newman (2002), Wittmann (1980, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|ˌ|v|w|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/de_beauvoir,_simone|title=de Beauvoir, Simone|work=[[Oxford American Dictionary]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|simɔn də bovwaʁ|lang|Fr-Simone de Beauvoir.ogg}}; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]]; and for her novels, including ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' and ''[[The Mandarins]]''. She was also known for her lifelong relationship with French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

==Early years==
===Family===
Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor,&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography"&gt;Mussett, Shannon. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/#H1 Simone de Beauvoir Biography on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, [[Hélène de Beauvoir|Hélène]], was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after [[World War I]], and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She lost her faith in her early teens and remained an [[atheism|atheist]] for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name = Thurman&gt;Thurman, Judith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/excerpt-introduction-second-sex.html Introduction to Simone de Beauvoir’s ''The Second Sex'']. Excerpt published in ''The New York Times'' 27 May 2010. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, "Simone thinks like a man!"&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her [[dowry]], and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Roberts, Mary Louise. "Beauvoir, Simone de." In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2008. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001/acref-9780195148909-e-90 Source]. Retrieved 3 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and literature/languages at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Sainte-Marie|fr}}. She then studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] for [[Léon Brunschvicg]] (the topic was "Le concept chez Leibniz" ["The Concept in Leibniz"]).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Simons (ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir'', Penn State Press, Nov 1, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

De Beauvoir first worked with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in preparation for the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the ''agrégation'' that she met ''École Normale'' students [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Nizan]], and [[René Maheu]] (who gave her the lasting nickname "Castor", or beaver).&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography" /&gt;  The jury for the ''agrégation'' narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.&lt;ref&gt;Menand, Louis.

Writing of her youth in ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'' she said:
"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', Book One&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle years==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial]]
From 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the [[lycée]] level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Montgrand|fr}} ([[Marseille]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen)|fr}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Molière (Paris)|fr}} (1936–39).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver (ed.), ''French Feminism Reader'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 1; ''Bulletin 2006 de l'Association amicale des anciens et anciennes élèves du lycée Molière'', 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 1929, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, pp. 155–56&lt;/ref&gt; One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, "Let's sign a two-year lease".&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, "Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry." So they entered a lifelong relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Lisa | last=Appignanesi | title=Our relationship was the greatest achievement of my life | date=10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and de Beauvoir's ''She Came to Stay'' and "Phenomenology and Intent". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]] and Leibniz.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt; The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Bauer, ''Simone de Beauvoir: Philosophy, and Feminism'', Columbia University Press, 2012, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Nelson Algren NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Waist high portrait of middle aged man reading|Algren in 1956]]
Beginning in 1929, de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were partners for fifty-one years until his death in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour-Jones 2008, p. Back cover&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir chose never to marry or set up a joint household and she never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, to write and teach, and to have lovers.&lt;ref name=Schneir&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miriam|title=Feminism in Our Time|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|page=5|isbn=0-679-74508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps her most famous lover was American author [[Nelson Algren]] whom she met in Chicago in 1947, and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as "my beloved husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-09-27/entertainment/9809270154_1_beauvoir-novelist-nelson-algren-simone|title=Simone de Beauvoir's Love Letters to Nelson Algren|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algren won the National Book Award for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' in 1950, and in 1954, de Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for ''[[The Mandarins]]'' in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/debeauvoir-love.html|title=Preface: A Transatlantic Love Affair|author=Le Bon-de Beauvoir, Sylvie|authorlink=Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|year=1997|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she lived with [[Claude Lanzmann]] from 1952 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stand By Your Man|author=Menand, Louis|date=September 26, 2005|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/26/stand-by-your-man|publisher=The New Yorker: Condé Nast|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodgers, Nigel|author-link1=Nigel Rodgers|author2=Thompson, Mel|author-link2=Mel Thompson|title=Philosophers Behaving Badly|year=2004|publisher=London: [[Peter Owen Publishers]]|isbn=072061368X|page=~186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former student [[Bianca Lamblin]] (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (English: ''Memoirs of a Disturbed Young Lady''), that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (1994, LGF – Livre de Poche; {{ISBN|978-2-253-13593-7}}/2006, Balland; {{ISBN|978-2-7158-0994-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil [[Natalie Sorokin]]e in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''Tête-à-tête: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', Hazel Rowley, HarperCollins, 2005, pp. 130–35, {{ISBN|0-06-052059-0}};{{ISBN|978-0-06-052059-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky'', Paul Johnson, Harper Perennial, 1988, pp. 238–38, {{ISBN|978-0-06-125317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

===''She Came to Stay''===
De Beauvoir published her first novel ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/|title=Beauvoir, Simone de {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with [[Olga Kosakiewicz]] and [[Wanda Kosakiewicz]]. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], a lover of de Beauvoir.

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a [[ménage à trois]] with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existentialist ethics===
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir &amp; Jean-Paul Sartre in Beijing 1955.jpg|thumb|Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in [[Beijing]], 1955]]
In 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'' (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt;

===''Les Temps modernes''===
{{main|Les Temps modernes}}
At the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', a political journal which Sartre founded along with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and others. De Beauvoir used ''Les Temps Modernes'' to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.

===Sexuality, existentialist feminism and ''The Second Sex''===
''[[The Second Sex]]'', first published in French as ''Le Deuxième Sexe'', turns the existentialist mantra that ''[[existence precedes essence]]'' into a feminist one: "One is not born but becomes a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 267&lt;/ref&gt; With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the [[sex-gender distinction]], that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Mari|last=Mikkola|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=3 January 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The fundamental source of women's oppression" Beauvoir notes, "is its historical and social construction as the quintessential" Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/beauvoir/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bergoffen|first=Debra|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir defines women as the "second sex" because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are "female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities". De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the "imperfect man", the "incidental" being.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm|title=Simone de Beauvoir The Second Sex, Woman as Other 1949|first=Simone de|last=Beauvoir|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the '[[immanence]]' to which they were previously resigned and reaching '[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.

Chapters of ''The Second Sex'' were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"&gt;Moi, Toril 'While We Wait: The English Translation of "The Second Sex" in Signs 27(4) (summer, 2002), pp. 1005–35.&lt;/ref&gt; For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"/&gt; Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327|title=Review: The Second Sex, by Simone de Beauvoir|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Woman: Myth and Reality" of ''The Second Sex'',&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone de. "Woman: Myth and Reality".&lt;br&gt;** in Jacobus, Lee A. (ed.). ''A World of Ideas''. Bedford/St. Martins, Boston 2006. 780–95.&lt;br&gt;** in Prince, Althea, and Susan Silva Wayne. ''Feminisms and Womanisms: A Women's Studies Reader''. Women's Press, Toronto 2004 p.&amp;nbsp;59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the "Other" in society by application of a false aura of "mystery" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt; However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallaize|first=Elizabeth|title=Simone de Beauvoir: A critical reader|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415147033|page=6|edition=Digital print }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the manuscript pages of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' were published. At the time her adopted daughter, [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir]], a philosophy professor, described her mother's writing process: Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after hired typists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/books/review/simone-de-beauvoir-second-sex-manuscript.html|title=Revisiting Simone de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex'' as a Work in Progress|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mandarins'' ===
[[File:Algren house Miller.jpg|thumb|Dunes cottage where Algren and de Beauvoir summered in [[Miller Beach]], Indiana]] 
Published in 1954, ''The Mandarins'' is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]''. The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer [[Nelson Algren]], to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.

==Later years==
[[File:Núñez-Beauvoir-Sartre-Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|left| [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], de Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] and [[Che Guevara]] in Cuba, 1960]]
De Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States &lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, "America Day by Day", Carol Cosman (Translator) and Douglas Brinkley (Foreword), Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780520210677}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.

1980 saw the publication of ''[[When Things of the Spirit Come First]]'', a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; Though written long before the novel ''She Came to Stay'', de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.

[[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps Modernes''. De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.

De Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter''; ''The Prime of Life''; ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''); and ''All Said and Done''.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

In the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir. Signatories were diverse as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]] and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.

Her 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In an interview with [[Betty Friedan]], de Beauvoir said: "No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction."&lt;ref&gt;“A Dialogue with Simone de Beauvoir,” in Betty Friedan, It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women’s Movement (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 311–12
&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit [[Kate Millett]] on her farm.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie Des Adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.

She contributed the piece "Feminism – alive, well, and in constant danger" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|Sylvie Le Bon]], unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

De Beauvoir died of [[pneumonia]] on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213135908/http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |archivedate=13 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

'''''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore''''' is a three volume set of books published in December 2005 by [[Greenwood Press]].  It contains roughly 700 alphabetically arranged entries by more than 100 contributors.  It serves as a comprehensive overview of all aspects of [[African-American]] folklore including folktales, music, foodways, spiritual beliefs, and art.&lt;ref&gt; Bob Duckett (2007), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1589226&amp;show=html&amp;''Reference Reviews''], Vol. 21, Iss: 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western States Folklore Society, reviewed by Ruth Perry, Western Folklore, Vol. 68, No. 4,&amp;nbsp;Fall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Recommended Reference Books for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries'' 2007, Vol. 27; review by Shannon Graff Hysell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore'' is unique in being the definitive encyclopedia relating to African-American traditions, background, and mores; a comprehensive overview of [[African-American culture]] and [[folklore]].   It contains alphabetically arranged entries and expert contributors on topics such as [[Folklore|folktales]], music, [[Black Arts Movement|art]], [[foodways]], [[Spirituality|spiritual beliefs]], [[proverbs]], and many other subjects. Entries cite works for further reading and the encyclopedia concludes with a bibliography of major works.

The set of books also gives attention to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]]n roots of traditional African-American culture.  The three volumes are intended to help scholars and students understand the heart of African-American culture and provides a comprehensive context for [[African-American history]], literature, music, and art.

==Reviews==

"The fact that more than 100 entries are devoted to scholars and collectors, among them [[Amiri Baraka|Imamu Amiri Baraka]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], and [[Melville J. Herskovits]], supports a statement Prahlad makes in the introduction. The encyclopedia seeks 'to provide a significant overview of the current study of African American folklore.... [This] first comprehensive general reference work' on African American folklore is highly recommended for academic and public libraries."&lt;ref name="REVIEWS"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Mary Ellen|last=Quinn|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|journal=[[Library Journal Review]] |date=February 1, 2006 |url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/?ref=menu |title=Library Journal Reviews — Previews, Reviews, and Collection Development |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The multidisciplinary nature of folklore studies is reflected in the list of 140 or so primarily academic contributors, whose areas of expertise include art, literature, anthropology, religion, and more....(the entries) make fascinating reading on topics as diverse as samba, the Sea Islands, sermons, Tupac Shakur, Stagolee, and the steel pan drum...."

'''''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''''' (2001) is an [[art history]] book  by Dr. Larry Shiner (1934- ), Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, History, and Visual Arts at the [[University of Illinois, Springfield]]  &lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History: review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-226-75342-3|journal=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3633486.html|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiner spent over a decade to finish the work of this book.&lt;ref name="uis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.edu/philosophy/faculty/research/shiner.html |title=Dr. Larry Shiner - Research - Philosophy |publisher=uis.edu |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The book sees [[fine art]] as a modern invention due to [[social transformation]]s during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

David Clowney, writing for ''Contemporary Aesthetics'' summarizes the central thesis of this book.

"In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History , Larry Shiner claims that [[Art]] with a capital A, [[Fine Art]], was invented in the west in the eighteenth century. The claim is not original with him; he credits [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]]’s essay “The Modern System of the Arts” as the inspiration for his work. Others have made this claim as well, among them [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Paul Mattick]], and [[Terry Eagleton]]. What Shiner has added is a detailed proof of the Kristeller claim using the methods of intellectual, social, cultural, and art history.

In brief, the thesis is this: There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art,” in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “[[skill]]”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war,” “the art of love,” and “the art of medicine.”"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=David Clowney|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into five parts
* ''I.   Before Fine Art and Craft'' - Details the lack of any differentiation between skilled work of any type during three periods of history; classical antiquity, the middle ages, and [[the Renaissance]]. The lack of any social role separating artists from artisans, nor any concept of the aesthetic is also discussed. In the final chapter of Part I, the beginnings of some differentiation during the 17th century is described.
* ''II.  Art Divided''
* ''III. Countercurrents'' 
* ''IV.  The Apotheosis of Art'' 
* ''V.   Beyond Art and Craft''.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

==Quotes==
“The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.” (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

== Reviews ==
In a book review published in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Mitch Avila   wrote:&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Avila|first1=Mitch|title=Reviews: The Invention of Art: A Cultural History by Larry Shiner|journal= The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume= 61|issue=4|pages=401–403|date=Autumn 2003|jstor= 1559075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shiner aptly characterizes his narrative as one that aims to heal the unnecessarily fractured conceptions of art and art practice that mark the contemporary artworld... By showing that the essentialist conception of art, along with its normative and regulative implications, is the artifact of a particular historical and cultural world, Shiner invites us to freely respond to the manifold richness of human expression and embellishment.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewer Marc Spiegler called the book "a must-read for anyone active in the arts".&lt;ref name=Spiegler&gt;

'''Tombstone tourist''' (otherwise known as a "cemetery enthusiast", "cemetery tourist", "grave hunter", "graver", or "taphophile") describes an individual who has a passion for and enjoyment of [[cemetery|cemeteries]], [[epitaph]]s, [[Stone rubbing|gravestone rubbing]], photography, art, and history of (famous) deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogak, Lisa |date=2004|title=Stones and Bones of New England: A guide to unusual, historic, and otherwise notable cemeteries|publisher= Globe Pequat |isbn= 0-7627-3000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been most notably used by author and biographer Scott Stanton as the title of his former website and book, ''The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians'' (2003), about the lives and gravesites of famous musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|authors=Stanton, Scott &amp; Stanton, Robin W. |isbn= 9780965996693|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cemetery tourists are particularly interested in the historical aspects of cemeteries or the historical relevance of their inhabitants. [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina and [[Zentralfriedhof]] (Central Cemetery) in [[Vienna, Austria]] carry a large array of famous inhabitants and their tombs, that make the cemeteries significant tourist destinations.

[[Genealogy tourism|Genealogy tourists]] make considerable effort to search out cemeteries and their records, to verify grave records and ancestral burial locations.

==History==
For centuries, people have made [[pilgrimages]] to the burial sites of religious icons and leaders.  In fact, such was common during medieval times when people went to gravesites or to shrines to venerate saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/NORpilgrimage.htm|title=Pilgrimage|author=Simkin, John|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the ancient tradition of [[Ancestor Worship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/a/ancestor_worship.html|title=Ancestor Worship|website=Themystica.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also involved a veneration of dead relatives with visitations to shrines and gravesites.

During the 19th century, garden cemeteries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/05/April/cemeteries.shtml|title=London's Victorian Garden Cemeteries|website=Timetravel-britain.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to appear that encouraged visitors to stay and visit in the cemetery. Famous among these is the [[Père Lachaise cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|title=Cimetière du Père Lachaise -Visite virtuelle - Cemetery's virtual tour - Jim Morrison - Edith Piaf|website=Pere-lachaise.com|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230091818/http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris, France]], which continues to invite tourists to visit and see elaborate memorials not only to the world famous, but to lesser known individuals as well.

Cemetery records have also been a way of verifying genealogical data. Making gravestone rubbings was in practice for centuries as a way of providing this documentation and appreciating the carvings on the tombstones. Among genealogists, scouring cemeteries looking for the graves of dead ancestors is a common and longstanding practice with individuals often relying on limited and outdated information to find burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsirat.com/silence/rubbings.html|title=City of the Silent - Tombstone Rubbings|website=Alsirat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
{{original research|section|date=July 2016}}
The appreciation of cemeteries has evolved along with science and technology.  The Internet allows enthusiasts to visit cemeteries (and in some cases the gravesites of their own ancestors) on websites such as [[Find a Grave]]. There are also many websites and books devoted to people's personal explorations into cemeteries, particularly ones that contain the remains of famous individuals. There are also tour companies that organize and plan tours to famous cemeteries.

The hunting of graves has become digital as many cemetery transcribers and ancestor hunters have begun using [[GPS]] equipment to locate the area where a graveyard or gravesite is reputed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrero|first1=Russell|title=Plotting a Grave Project|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/on_campus/cemetary_project/|website=Trinity University|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Travel technology''' (also called '''tourism technology''', and '''hospitality automation''') is the application of [[Information Technology]] (IT) or [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) in the [[travel]], [[tourism]] and [[hospitality industry]].  One form of travel technology is [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]].

Since travel implies locomotion, travel technology was originally associated with the [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) of the airlines industry, but now is used more inclusively, incorporating the broader tourism sector as well as its subset the hospitality industry. While travel technology includes the computer reservations system, it also represents a much broader range of applications, in fact increasingly so.  Travel technology includes [[virtual tourism]] in the form of [[virtual tour]] technologies.  Travel technology may also be referred to as ''e-travel'' / ''etravel'' or ''e-tourism'' / ''etourism'' ([[eTourism]]), in reference to "electronic travel" or "electronic tourism".

e-Tourism can be defined as the analysis, design, implementation and application of IT and e-commerce solutions in the [http://www.skypointindia.com/how-to-start-an-online-travel-agency-india.html travel&amp;tourism industry]; as well as the analysis of the respective economic processes and market structures and [[customer relationship management]].

From a communication science perspective, eTourism can be also defined as every application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) within both the hospitality and tourism industry, as well as within the tourism experience.

Travel technology is increasingly being used to describe systems for managing and monitoring travel, including travel tracking and [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]] systems.

In other contexts, the term "travel technology" can refer to technology intended for use by travelers, such as light-weight laptop computers with universal power supplies or satellite Internet connections. That is not the sense in which it is used here.

== Applications ==
Travel technology includes many processes such as [[dynamic packaging]] which provide useful new options for consumers.  Today the [[tour guide]] can be a GPS tour guide, and the [[guidebook]] could be an [[audioguide]], [[podguide]] or [[I-Tours]], such as [[City audio guides]].  The [[biometric passport]] may also be included as travel technology in the broad sense.

[[XML|XML-based]] technologies have become increasingly important for the travel industry. XML can be used to support air reservation booking or to implement optional services and merchandising functions in the booking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openaxisgroup.org/functions.html|title=Research Vacation Spots by category and city|author=|date=|website=www.openaxisgroup.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important application of XML is the establishing of direct connections between Airlines and Travel Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael, ''Value Creation in Travel Distribution'', 2010, {{ISBN|0557612462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to create a generally accepted XML-standard, the Open Axis Group was founded.

=== Internet ===
The Internet has a powerful impact on hospitality and tourism. For many businesses and locations, the experience starts long before a traveler arrives--it begins with the first visit to the website, when a person sees photos of the location and gets a sense of what to expect. In the hospitality and tourism business, effective use of Internet technologies can improve revenue. Websites, blogs, online advertising, social media, online ordering and information repositories all help convince customers to choose a location or business.
Reservations Systems

Booking engines to allow easy access by consumers and travel professionals; the systems enable individuals to make reservations and compare prices. Many, like Expedia and Orbitz, are available through online interfaces. Booking engines cut costs for travel businesses by reducing call volume and give the traveler more control over their purchasing process.

=== Computer Systems ===
Because many tourism businesses are large and dispersed, they use computer systems to stay connected. Computer systems allow communication between branches and locations which makes it easier to streamline reservations and cross-company policies. They are also used internally to keep all of the staff on the same page and make it easier to access information that can improve the guest experience: guest preferences, housekeeping information and reservation details can all be kept on a single system.

=== Mobile Communication ===
Many travelers take some form of mobile communication device with them on the road, whether it is a tablet computer or a mobile phone. To keep customers advised of changes many tourism and hospitality businesses use mobile communication; they send delay notices, offer deals and sponsor location-based advertising. Depending on the type of business the communication might happen through emails, text messaging or GPS tagging, for example.

=== Technology in Travel Agency ===
The continuing evolution of information technology has had a considerable impact on the travel agency service industry. The widespread public use of the Internet has created a number of conditions that have been game-changers -- in both beneficial and detrimental ways -- to the modern travel agency. As a result, many travel agencies in the 21st century have had to make considerable adaptations to remain solvent and relevant.

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

'''Usog''' or '''balis''' is a topic in psycho-medicine in [[Filipino Psychology]] (but considered just as a [[Philippines|Filipino]] superstition in Western Psychology) where an affliction or psychological disorder is attributed to a greeting by a stranger, or an [[evil eye]] [[Curse|hex]]. It usually affects an unsuspecting child, usually an infant or toddler, who has been greeted by a visitor or a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuartxchange.com/PweUsog.html PWE-USOG / PWE-BUYAG: Miscellaneous Therapies in Philippine Alternative Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some limited areas, it is said that the condition is also caused by the stranger having an evil eye or ''masamang mata'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], lurking around. This may have been influenced by the advent of the Spaniards who long believed in the ''[[mal de ojo]]'' superstition.

Once affected, the child begins to develop [[fever]], and sometimes [[convulsion]]s. Supposedly, the child can be cured by placing its clothing in hot water and boiling it.  In most other places, to counter the effects of the "usog" the stranger or newcomer is asked to put some of his or her [[saliva]] on the baby's abdomen, shoulder or forehead before leaving the house. The newcomer then leaves while saying: "''Pwera usog... pwera usog...''" The saliva is placed on the finger first, before the finger is rubbed on the baby's abdomen or forehead. The stranger is never to lick the child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viloria.com/secondthoughts/archives/00000176.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice is that the stranger or visitor is asked to touch his or her finger with saliva to the child's body, arm or foot (''"lawayan"'') to prevent the child from getting overpowered (''"upang hindi mausog"'').

==Possible scientific explanation==

One theory (Kristina Palacio)&lt;ref&gt;Fadul, J. Public Forum on Witchcraft and Illnesses. Rizal Technological and Polytechnic Institute, Morong, Rizal. July 24, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100% PINOY"&gt;100% PINOY (Kapuso Network's cultural program on GMA7 featuring Filipino Culture and Ingenuity to strengthen the Filipino identity.) Aired internationally through GMA Pinoy TV. "Bata, bata, paano ka ginawa?" episode aired August 28, 2008. Pinoy culture, beliefs and practices about "paglilihi, pagbubuntis, panganganak at pag-aalaga sa bata".&lt;/ref&gt; explains ''usog'' in terms of child distress that leads to greater susceptibility to illness and diseases. There are observations that a stranger (or a newcomer or even a visiting relative) especially someone with a strong personality (physically big, boisterous, has strong smell, domineering, etc.) may easily distress a child. Thus, the child is said to be "overpowered" or ''nauusog'' and thus may feel afraid, develop fever, get sick, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen S, Janicki-Deverts D, Miller GE | title = Psychological stress and disease. | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 14 | pages = 1685–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17925521 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/298/14/1685 | doi = 10.1001/jama.298.14.1685}} "Stress Contributes To Range Of Chronic Diseases, Review Shows" ScienceDaily.com (Oct. 10, 2007) [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071009164122.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In ''usog'', the child's distress is the consequence of the child's failure to adapt to change. It is, in [[medical]] terms, the consequence of the disruption of homeostasis through physical or psychological stimuli brought about by the stranger.&lt;ref name="Revisiting"&gt;{{cite book

The stressful stimuli to the child may be mental (stranger is perceived as a threat, malevolent or demanding), physiological (loud and/or high-pitched voice of the stranger that is hurting to the child's eardrum; strong smell of the stranger that irritates the child's nasal nerves), or physical (stranger has heavy hands or is taking up too much space).

The stranger's act of gently placing his finger with his saliva to the child's arm, foot, or any particular part of the child's body, could make him more familiar to the child, and thus, reduce if not remove the stress. As the stranger keeps gently saying, "Pwera usog... pwera usog...," the child is made to feel and assured that he means no harm.  The ''usog'' is said to be counteracted because the child is prevented from succumbing to an illness since the child is no longer in distress. Children or even adults who are shy or have weak personalities are more susceptible to ''usog'' in accordance with observations and theory. Some have observed that at times even praising a shy child by a visiting relative caused an ''usog''.&lt;ref name="100% PINOY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JakqnTEuUsE Usog]&lt;/ref&gt;

The saliva from the stranger, granted that he or she is healthy and consistent with his or her [[oral hygiene]], is relatively clean&lt;ref&gt;http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/11/14/lick-your-wounds/ Neurophilosophy: Lick your wounds&lt;/ref&gt; and contains enough [[antimicrobial]] compounds such as [[lactoferrin]], [[lactoperoxidase]], and secretory [[immunoglobulin A]] which can help clear [[pathogens]] from the child and benefit the child against infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover.com/issues/oct-05/departments/the-biology-of-saliva/ Discover Magazine, "The Biology of ...Saliva" October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, human saliva has [[opiorphin]], a newly researched pain-killing substance. Initial research with mice shows the compound has a painkilling effect of up to six times that of morphine. It works by stopping the normal breakdown of natural pain-killing opioids in the spine, called [[enkephalins]]. Opiorphin in human saliva is a relatively simple molecule, and the child's immune system may trigger a [[biochemical cascade]] ([[complement system]]) to produce other stress-reducing compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wisner |first=Anne |author2=Evelyne Dufour |author3=Michaël Messaoudi |author4=Amine Nejdi |author5=Audrey Marcel |author6=Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer |author7=Catherine Rougeot |title=Human Opiorphin, a natural antinociceptive modulator of opioid-dependent pathways |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=103 |pages=17979–17984 |date=November 13, 2006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605865103 |pmid=17101991 |issue=47 |pmc=1693858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10514|title=Natural-born painkiller found in human saliva|author=Andy Coghlan|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6142842.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Natural chemical 'beats morphine'|date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/2006/1113/3|title=Prolonging Painkillers|author=Mary Beckman|publisher=[[Science (journal)|ScienceNOW]]|date=November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usog can also, though less commonly, affect adults, and it may induce vomiting and stomach ache rather than fever. Supposedly, it can be prevented by stopping a stranger or visitor from greeting the person.

Unlike "[[lihi]]", however, usog is not yet medically accepted. More than the superstitious folks, researchers dealing with Filipino Psychology say they have observed this phenomenon with regularity and suggest that this be added to the Psychiatric Disorders Handbook [[DSM-V]].&lt;ref name ="100% PINOY" /&gt;
