The '''abacost''', abbreviation for the French ''"à bas le costume"'' (literally "down with the suit"), was the distinctive clothing for men that was promoted by [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'' programme in [[Zaire]], between 1972 and 1990. Zairians were banned from wearing Western-style [[suit (clothing)|suits]] with [[shirt]] and [[necktie|tie]] to symbolise the break with their colonial past. The abacost was a lightweight suit, worn without a tie, though sometimes with a [[cravat]]. It closely resembled a [[Mao suit]]. It was seen in long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions.

The abacost was seen as the uniform of Mobutu's supporters, especially those who had benefited from his regime. When Mobutu announced a transition to multiparty democracy in 1990, he said that the Western suit and tie would be allowed, but that he continued to favor the abacost and it would still be considered the national dress. Subsequently, when the transitional government was sworn in, all of the ministers were wearing abacosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0148) ''Zaire: A Country Study'' POLITICAL REFORM IN THE 1990s - Proclamation of the Third Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arzoni]] in [[Asse|Zellik, Belgium]] produced the world's "chicest" abacosts.&lt;ref name=dvr&gt;{{cite book| author=[[David van Reybrouck]]| title=[[Congo: The Epic History of a People]]| publisher=[[HarperCollins]], 2012 |page=381f |isbn=978-0-06-220011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfons Mertens, employed by Arzoni, became Mobutu's personal tailor, also making uniforms for him and his entourage.&lt;ref name=dvr/&gt;

The abacost fell out of favour after Mobutu's fall from power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''Addis Ababa Agreement''', also known as the [[Addis Ababa]] Accord, was a set of compromises within a 1972 treaty that ended the [[First Sudanese Civil War]]  (1955–1972) fighting in [[Sudan]]. The Addis Ababa accords were incorporated in the [[Constitution of Sudan]].

==Preliminaries and Negotiations==
Direct Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the [[Anyanya| Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM)]] in Addis Ababa were preceded in 1971 by a series of discussions through the intermediation of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches| All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC)]] and [[World Council of Churches| World Council of Churches (WCC)]].  In Addis Ababa, in 1972, [[Abel Alier]] led the delegation representing the Government of Sudan.  [[Ezboni Mondiri]] led the delegation of the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9NIrNTedJkC&amp;pg=PA188 |title=Eastern African history |first=Robert O. |last=Collins |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |year=1991 |ISBN=1-55876-016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negotiations were moderated by [[Burgess Carr]], who was then the Secretary General of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Juba University |editor-first=Rift Valley Institute |title=We Have Lived Too Long to Be Deceived: South Sudanese discuss the lessons of historic peace agreements  |url= http://riftvalley.net/publication/we-have-lived-too-long-be-deceived|location= London, UK |publisher=Rift Valley Institute |date=2015 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Agreement had the goal to address and appease concerns of the southern Sudan liberation and secession movement, as the First Sudanese Civil War grew costly in lives and resources to the northern Sudanese government and southern population. The Addis Ababa Agreement's establishment of the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (1972–83)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] gave a degree of [[autonomy]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sudan.html#Southern&lt;/ref&gt; It meant South Sudan would no longer be divided into the three separate regions Al-Istiwāʾiyyah (Equatoria), Baḥr al-Ghazāl, and Aʿālī al-Nīl (Upper Nile). The region would run itself through a separate legislative and executive body. The soldiers of the Anya Nya would be integrated into the Sudanese army and police force. The Addis Ababa Agreement gave Nimeri popularity and prestige both within Sudan and outside of the country. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan/The-Addis-Ababa-Agreement#ref48975&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade of relative peace followed, though the Addis Ababa Agreement failed to dispel the tensions that had originally caused civil war.  The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Resource infringements and marginalisation by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the late 1970s.

==Termination==
In 1983 President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] declared all Sudan an [[Islamic state]] under [[Shari'a]] law, including the non-Islamic majority southern region. The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052232/http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiated the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005).

==Aims==
Al-Muhajiroun's proclaimed aims are to establish public awareness about Islam, to influence public opinion in favour of the [[sharia]], to convince members of society that Islam is inherently political and a viable ideological alternative, to unite Muslims on a global scale in the threats facing the [[Ummah]] and to resume the Islamic way of life by re-establishing the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt; Members have carried out numerous murders and terrorist attacks.

==History==
[[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] and [[Anjem Choudary]] are known to have led Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3110115.stm Police raid Islamic group]| BBC News |30 July 2003 |accessed 2 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakri founded Al-Muhajiroun in [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia on 3 March 1983 following "the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]]," in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia.  According to at least one scholar ([[Sadek Hamid]]), the group was a front for [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] in the Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamid|first=Sadek|title=Islamic Political Radicalism: A European Perspective|date=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-74863-086-4|pages=148|editor=Tahir Abbas|chapter=Islamic Political Radicalism in Britain: the case of Hizb-ut-Tahrir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hilBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |ref=IPRBcHT2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where political parties are illegal). According to Bakri, the Hizb ut-Tahrir leadership did not accept the group. As such, Bakri established Al-Muhajiroun independently from Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI&gt;

Bakri claims that he studied at the universities of Umm ul-Qura' in Makkah and the [[Islamic University of Madinah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Fiqh'', Bakri (London: The Islamic Book Company, 1996), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Bakri also studied with, and was assessed by, Dr. [[Abdur Rahman Dimishqia]].&lt;ref name="Hizb ut-Tahreer"&gt;''Hizb ut-Tahreer'', Dr. Abdur Rahman Dimishqia,  (Istanbul: Maktabah ul-Ghurabaa', 1417 AH/1997 CE)&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Saudi Arabia he worked for ''Eastern Electric'' owned by Shamsan and [[Abdul-Aziz as-Suhaybi]] in [[Riyadh]], and then Bakri moved to its Jeddah branch. Later he traveled to America to study English after which he went to the UK to assume the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name ="Hizb ut-Tahreer" /&gt;

The [[Saudi Arabian government]] banned Al-Muhajiroun in January 1986, prompting Bakri to leave. On 14 January 1986, he arrived in Britain, where he worked as part of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI/&gt; Bakri's involvement in Hizb ut-Tahrir ended on 16 January 1996 when he was dismissed by the group's global leadership. Following the emergence of Al-Muhajiroun in early 1996, Bakri would later become the chief sponsor in Britain of the [[International Islamic Front]], an organization that trained and sent British Citizens to fight in [[Chechnya]] and the [[Balkans]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===NUS ban===
In March 2001 Britain's [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] banned Al-Muhajiroun after they received complaints from Muslim and non-Muslim students about the group distributing [[hate literature]] and the organization training members in militant camps.  Al-Muhajiroun members put up posters and handed out leaflets in [[Manchester University]]'s campus where the police were called and at the [[University of Birmingham]] campus that called for the killing of Jews.  A spokesman for NUS said that if Al-Muhajiroun did not support violence against Jews then they should change their "highly militant and definitely not peaceful" literature.&lt;ref name=GENOCIDE&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122202951/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010921g.html UK Islamic Group, Banned from Campus, Claims Misrepresentation]| [[CNS News]]| Mike Wendling | September 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Council of Britain===
[[Abu Hamza al-Masri]] created the [[Islamic Council of Britain]] to "implement sharia law in Britain," on 11 September 2002, the first anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], primarily through funding from Al-Muhajiroun. Masri celebrated the establishment of the ICB and the 9/11 attacks by holding a conference in [[Finsbury Park mosque]] in [[North London]] entitled "September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History." Bakri, who attended the conference, said, that attendees "look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the [[mujahideen]] against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it." Flyers distributed at the conference referred to the 9/11 hijackers as the "Magnificent 19." Bakri said he saw [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists as "sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country." [[Anjem Choudary]], British spokesman for Al Muhajiroun also attended.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt; Just days after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the Oxford-based Malaysian jurist, [[Afifi al-Akiti|Shaykh Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti]], issued his landmark fatwa against suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians, titled [http://www.livingislam.org/maa/dcmm_e.html ''Defending the Transgressed, by Censuring the Reckless against the Killing of Civilians''], which was written in response to this controversial "Magnificent 19" statement made by Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warda.info/fatwa.pdf ''Defending the Transgressed'' (2005), p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] Tony Blair announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism.&lt;ref name=DISBANDMENT/&gt;

The group was then relaunched in 2009 under the alias "Islam4UK".{{cn|date=April 2017}} A demonstration it made against returning British soldiers in Luton gained media attention and led to the formation of the [[English Defence League]] (EDL).&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8266933.stm

===2014 mutation as Need4Khilafah===

In June 2014, the UK government banned three more groups it suspected of being aliases for the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun:&lt;ref name=bbc14/&gt;

===Statements===
Aside from declaring the [[Hijackers_in_the_September_11_attacks|9/11 hijackers]] "the Magnificent 19", controversial statements made by al-Muhajiroun include one warning the British government that it was "sitting on a box of dynamite and have only themselves to blame if after attacking the Islamic movements and the Islamic scholars, it all blows up in their face".&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE/&gt;

In 2004 [[BBC Newsnight]] quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, [[Sajeel Shahid|Abu Ibrahim]], as saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When they speak about 11 September, when the two planes magnificently run through those buildings, OK and people turn around and say, 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance. ... For us it's retaliation. Islam is not the starter of wars. If you start the war we won't turn the other cheek. ... According to you it can't be right. According to Islam it's right. When you talk about innocent civilians, do you not kill innocent civilians in Iraq?&lt;ref name=IBRAHIM&gt;

===Attacks===
On 29 April 2003, Asif Hanif who attended some of Al-Muhajiroun's circles carried out a bombing of a café in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, that killed three people and injured 60 others.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie|last2=Wander|first2=Andrew|title=The network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/06/terrorism.jamiedoward|work=The Observer|date=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIVILDEATHS&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249521,00.html New poll shows worry over Islamic terror threat, to be detailed in special FNC Report] Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, another individual connected with Al-Muhajiroun allegedly detonated a [[suicide bombing|bomb]] in India, killing himself and destroying an army barracks.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt;

In 2007, five young Muslims with Al-Muhajiroun connections  – [[Omar Khyam]], [[Waheed Mahmood]], Anthony Garcia, [[Jawad Akbar]] and [[Saladhuddin Amin]] – were convicted of a [[Operation Crevice|multiple bombing plot]] to use fertiliser bombs "which police say could have killed hundreds of British people. The men were caught after police and MI5 launched a massive surveillance operation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6153884.stm Fertiliser bomb plot: The story. By Chris Summers and Dominic Casciani. 30 April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The surveillance culminated in a raid called [[Operation Crevice]]. The targets included "the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and Britain's domestic gas network." According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 May 2013, the [[murder of Lee Rigby]] was carried out by two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was corrupted by Bakri and then by Choudary,&lt;ref name=dtlr/&gt; after Bakri left the country in August 2005.&lt;ref name=PUBLICGOOD&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4133150.stm|title=Cleric Bakri 'will return' to UK|publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2005|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former associate said Adebolajo that “locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert. He was spouting all kinds of stuff and said he had changed his name." Adebolajo insisted to be called during the Rigby trial "[[Mujahid]]".&lt;ref name=dtlr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10528365/Lee-Rigby-killers-from-quiet-Christians-to-Islamist-murderers.html |title=Lee Rigby killers: from quiet Christians to Islamist murderers |publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=15 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2154">The '''CSJ Awards''' are an annual event organised by the [[Centre for Social Justice]], a centre right British political thinktank, where grants are awarded to organisations working in the field of [[poverty]] relief. In 2009, a [[Channel 4]] documentary series was made by filmmaker and TV presenter [[Sadie Kaye]] about the award nominees which also featured interviews with the Rt. Hon. [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and awards host [[Esther Rantzen]]. 

==2006 Awards==

The 2006 award ceremony will be held on the 28 June 2006 at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London]]. Grants totalling £25,000 will be given to a number of the 12 short-listed charities nominated this year. All short-listed charities will also be invited to join the [[CSJ Alliance]], a grouping of charities who work in similar fields and wish to cooperate with each other.

==2005 Awards==

The following organisations won grants at the 2005 awards ceremony:

* [[ADAS UK]] (£5000) - providing abstinence-based addiction rehabilitiation in [[Stockport]]
* [[Bristol Community Family Trust]] (£3000) - engaged in relationship education and parenting classes
* [[Eden Failsworth]] - a [[Christian]] youth project in a deprived area of [[Manchester]]
* [[Emmaus UK]] (£1000) - supporting ten communities throughout Britain helping former homeless people
* [[Protest 4]] (£3000) - campaign against people-trafficking

A local authority award (no money) was also made to Salford City Council for its highly developed relationship with voluntary groups as part of its efforts to tackle poverty.

{{Green politics sidebar |Schools}}'''Eco-socialism''', '''green socialism''' or '''socialist ecology''' is an [[ideology]] merging aspects of [[socialism]] with that of [[green politics]], [[ecology]] and [[alter-globalization]] or [[anti-globalization]]. Eco-socialists generally believe that the expansion of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[poverty]], [[war]] and [[environmental degradation]] through [[globalization]] and [[imperialism]], under the supervision of repressive [[State (polity)|states]] and transnational structures.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kovel, J. |author2=Löwy, M. |title=An ecosocialist manifesto |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Eco-socialists advocate dismantling capitalism, focusing on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] by freely associated producers, and restoring the [[commons]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}  [[Caroline Lucas]], former leader of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], has described her party's brand of socialism as appealing to both middle-class environmentalists as well as working-class socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFG3INb7VWU |title=Labour 'never challenged the austerity narrative' {{!}} Owen Jones talks to Caroline Lucas |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-07-31 |accessdate=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==

Eco-socialists are critical of many past and existing forms of both [[Green politics]] and [[socialism]]. They are often described as "[[Red (political adjective)|Red]] Greens" - adherents to Green politics with clear [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] views, often inspired by [[Marxism]] (Red Greens are in contrast to [[Eco-capitalism|eco-capitalists]] and [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]]).

The term "watermelon" is commonly applied, often pejoratively, to [[Green politics|Greens]] who seem to put "[[social justice]]" goals above [[Ecology|ecological]] ones, implying they are "green on the outside but red on the inside"; the term is usually attributed to either [[Petr Beckmann]] or, more frequently, [[Warren T. Brookes]],&lt;ref name="RatsNestWatermelon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.win.net/ratsnest/archive-articles-13/fog0000000219.html |publisher=Rats Nest |format=Blog |title=''A Blogroll, please'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NoWatermelonBlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nowatermelons.blogspot.com/2007_02_25_archive.html |title=No Watermelons Allowed |format=Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAmericanSpectator"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://spectator.org/articles/45094/man-who-saw-tomorrow |journal=The American Spectator |date=13 July 2007 |title=The Man Who Saw Tomorrow }}&lt;/ref&gt; both critics of [[environmentalism]], and is common in Australia,&lt;ref name="AustrailianWatermelon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1198314.htm |publisher=Media Watch |title=Stolen watermelons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AustrailianWatermelon2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/09/07/1194186.htm |title=Brown dismisses Govt name-calling |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=September 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand&lt;ref name="WatermelonNZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewatermelon.org/ |title=The Watermelon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref name=Frontpage&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=7165 FrontPage magazine.com :: ''The Green Menace'' by Christopher Archangelli]&lt;/ref&gt;

A New Zealand website, ''The Watermelon'', uses the term proudly, stating that it is "green on the outside and [[Social liberalism|liberal]] on the inside", while also citing "socialist political leanings", reflecting the use of the term "liberal" to describe the [[left wing]] in many English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=WatermelonNZ/&gt; Red Greens are often considered "[[fundi (politics)|fundies]]" or "fundamentalist greens", a term usually associated with [[Deep ecology|Deep Ecology]] even though the [[German Green Party]] "fundi" faction included eco-socialists, and eco-socialists in other [[Green Parties]], like [[Derek Wall]], have been described in the press as fundies.&lt;ref name=Mail21Sep&gt;"Triumph for 'Fundies' hits Green Party", ''Daily Mail'', 21 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LynasBlog&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200707120024 Mark Lynas' ''New Statesman'' Blog - ''Even Greens need leaders'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-socialists also criticise bureaucratic and elite theories of self-described socialism such as [[Maoism]], [[Stalinism]] and what other critics have termed [[bureaucratic collectivism]] or [[state capitalism]]. Instead, eco-socialists focus on imbuing socialism with ecology while keeping the emancipatory goals of "first-epoch" socialism.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialists aim for communal ownership of the [[means of production]] by "freely associated producers" with all forms of domination eclipsed, especially [[Ecofeminism|gender inequality]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This often includes the restoration of [[commons]] land in opposition to [[private property]],&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;Guha, R. and Martinez-Alier, J., ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in which local control of resources valorizes the Marxist concept of [[use value]] above [[exchange value]].&lt;ref name=Kovel&gt;Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Practically, eco-socialists have generated various strategies to mobilise action on an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] basis, developing networks of grassroots individuals and groups that can radically transform society through [[Non-violence|nonviolent]] "prefigurative projects" for a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Anti-statism|post-statist]] world.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

(ed.), ''The Greening of Marxism'', 1996 (New York: Guildford)&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Productivism|productivist]] who favoured the domination of nature, eco-socialists have revisited Marx's writings and believe that he "was a main originator of the [[Ecology|ecological]] world-view".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialist authors, like [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name=JBF&gt;Foster, J.

[[William Morris]], the [[England|English]] novelist, poet and designer, is largely credited with developing key principles of what was later called eco-socialism.&lt;ref name=Babylon&gt;Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s and 1890s, Morris promoted his eco-socialist ideas within the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]].&lt;ref name=GLSite&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.uk Green Left (Green Party of England and Wales) Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205093251/http://www.greenleft.org.uk/ |date=5 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], some [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]]s and [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]]s attempted to integrate [[Ecology|ecological]] consciousness into [[Bolshevism]], although many such people were later purged from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Gare&gt;Gare, A., ''Soviet Environmentalism: The Path Not Taken'', in Benton, E. (ed.) ''The Greening of Marxism'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The "pre-revolutionary environmental movement", encouraged by revolutionary scientist [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]] and the [[Proletkult|Proletkul't]] organisation, made efforts to "integrate production with natural laws and limits" in the first decade of Soviet rule, before [[Joseph Stalin]] attacked ecologists and the science of ecology and the [[Soviet Union]] fell into the [[pseudo-science]] of the state biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]], who "set about to rearrange the Russian map" in ignorance of environmental limits.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Ecoanarchism ===
{{Green anarchism |Related}}
{{Main article|Green anarchism}}
Green anarchism, or ecoanarchism, is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of thought]] within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA.

[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the [[counterculture]].

''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' is a collection of [[essay]]s written by [[Murray Bookchin]] and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, his book ''The Ecology of Freedom'' had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement, both in the United States and abroad. He was a principal figure in the Burlington Greens in 1986-90, an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to create neighborhood democracy.

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called "[[Communalism (Political Philosophy)|Communalism]]" (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[Social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[Libertarian Municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state.

===1970s–1990s – Rise of environmentalism and engagement with Marxism and 'actually existing socialism'===
In the 1970s, [[Barry Commoner]], suggesting a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] response to ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic [[resource depletion]] and spurred [[environmentalism]], postulated that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for [[environmental degradation]], as opposed to [[Human overpopulation|population pressures]].&lt;ref name=Commoner&gt;Commoner, B., ''The Closing Circle'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Germany|East German]] dissident writer and activist [[Rudolf Bahro]] published two books addressing the relationship between socialism and ecology – ''[[The Alternative in Eastern Europe]]''&lt;ref name=Bahro&gt;Bahro, R., ''The Alternative in Eastern Europe'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Socialism and Survival]]''&lt;ref name=Bahro1&gt;Bahro, R., ''Socialism and Survival'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; – which promoted a 'new party' and led to his arrest, for which he gained international notoriety.

At around the same time, [[Alan Roberts (activist)|Alan Roberts]], an Australian [[Marxism|Marxist]], posited that people's unfulfilled needs fuelled [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, A., ''The Self-Managing Environment'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Australian [[Ted Trainer]] further called upon [[socialists]] to develop a system that met human needs, in contrast to the capitalist system of created wants.&lt;ref name=Trainer&gt;Trainer, T., ''Abandon Affluence!'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A key development in the 1980s was the creation of the journal ''[[Capitalism, Nature, Socialism]]'' (CNS) with [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]] as founding editor and the first issue in 1988. The debates ensued led to a host of theoretical works by O'Connor, [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Paul Burkett]] and others.

The Australian [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Democratic Socialist Party]] launched the [[Green Left Weekly]] newspaper in 1991, following a period of working within Green Alliance and Green Party groups in formation. This ceased when the [[Australian Greens]] adopted a policy of proscription of other political groups in August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;"Green Politics at an impasse" http://www.dsp.org.au/node/140&lt;/ref&gt; The DSP also published a comprehensive policy resolution, "Socialism and Human Survival" in book form in 1990, with an expanded second edition in 1999 entitled "Environment, Capitalism &amp; Socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsp.org.au/node/85|title=Environment, Capitalism and Socialism - DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PERSPECTIVE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s onwards – Engagement with the anti-globalization movement and The Ecosocialist Manifesto===
The 1990s saw the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminists]] [[Mary Mellor]]&lt;ref name=Mellor&gt;Mellor, M., ''Breaking the Boundaries: Towards a Feminist, Green Socialism'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ariel Salleh]]&lt;ref name=Salleh&gt;Saller, A., ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; address environmental issues within an eco-socialist paradigm. With the rising profile of the [[anti-globalization]] movement in the [[Global South]], an "[[environmentalism]] of the poor", combining [[Ecology|ecological]] awareness and [[social justice]], has also become prominent.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; [[David Pepper (Eco-socialist)|David Pepper]] also released his important work, ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', in 1994, which critiques the current approach of many within Green politics, particularly [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]].&lt;ref name=DPepper&gt;Pepper, D., ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Joel Kovel]], a [[Social science|social scientist]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] and former candidate for the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party of the United States]] (GPUS) [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination in 2000, and [[Michael Löwy]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and member of the [[Reunified Fourth International]] (a principal [[Trotskyist]] organisation), released ''An ecosocialist manifesto'', which has been adopted by some organisations&lt;ref name=GLSite/&gt; and suggests possible routes for the growth of eco-socialist consciousness.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel's 2002 work, ''The Enemy of Nature: The End of Capitalism or the End of the World?'',&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt; is considered by many to be the most up-to-date exposition of eco-socialist thought.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

In October 2007, the [[International Ecosocialist Network]] was founded in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2007/10/383067.html|title=Ecosocialist International Founded - UK Indymedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on current Green and socialist movements===
Currently, many [[Green Parties]] around the world, such as the [[GreenLeft|Dutch Green Left Party]] (GroenLinks){{citation needed|date=January 2016}} , contain strong eco-socialist elements. Radical [[Red-green alliance]]s have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical [[Green politics|Greens]] and other radical left groups. In Denmark, the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the [[European Parliament]], a number of [[far-left]] parties from [[Northern Europe]] have organized themselves into the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]]. Red Greens feature heavily in the [[Green Party of Saskatchewan]] (in Canada but not necessarily affiliated to the [[Green Party of Canada]]) and then-recently [[Green Party (United States)|GPUS]] that officially adopted ideology within party.&lt;ref name="gp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=835|title=Green Party of the United States – National Committee Voting – Proposal Details|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], that was founded in June 2005 and whose members hold a number of influential positions within the party, including both the former [[Principal Speaker]]s [[Siân Berry]] and Dr. [[Derek Wall]], himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic, as well as prominent [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate and human rights activist [[Peter Tatchell]].&lt;ref name=GLSite/&gt; Many Marxist organisations also contain eco-socialists, as evidenced by [[Michael Löwy|Löwy's]] involvement in the [[reunified Fourth International]] and ''[[Socialist Resistance]]'', a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist]] newspaper that reports on eco-socialist issues and has published two collections of essays on eco-socialist thought: ''Ecosocialism or Barbarism?'', edited by [[Jane Kelly (eco-socialist)|Jane Kelly]] and [[Sheila Malone]], and ''The Global Fight for Climate Justice'', edited by [[Ian Angus (activist)|Ian Angus]] with a foreword by Derek Wall.&lt;ref name=SR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistresistance.net/|title=socialistresistance.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SRBooks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resistancebooks.blogspot.com/|title=Resistance Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on "existing socialist" regimes===
Eco-socialism has had a minor influence over developments in the [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]] of what can be called "existing [[Socialism|socialist]]" regimes, notably the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Pan Yue (politician)|Pan Yue]], Deputy Director of the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]'s [[State Environmental Protection Administration]], has acknowledged the influence of eco-socialist theory on his championing of [[environmentalism]] within [[People's Republic of China|China]], which has gained him international acclaim (including being nominated for the Person of the Year Award 2006 by ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]'',&lt;ref name=NSYue&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200612180028 ''The New Statesman'' 18 December 2006 - ''Person of the year: The man making China green'']&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United Kingdom|British]] current affairs magazine). [[Pan Yue (politician)|Yue]] stated in an interview that, while he often finds eco-socialist theory "too idealistic" and lacking "ways of solving actual problems", he believes that it provides "political reference for China’s scientific view of development", "gives socialist ideology room to expand" and offers "a theoretical basis for the establishment of fair international rules" on the [[Natural environment|environment]].

He echoes much of eco-socialist thought, attacking international "environmental inequality", refusing to focus on [[technological fix]]es and arguing for the construction of "a harmonious, resource-saving and environmentally-friendly society". He also shows a knowledge of eco-socialist history, from the convergence of radical green politics and socialism and their political "[[red-green alliance]]s" in the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era. This focus on eco-socialism has informed an essay, ''On Socialist Ecological Civilisation'', published in September 2006, which, according to [[chinadialogue]], "sparked debate" in [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name=YueInterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/493--The-rich-consume-and-the-poor-suffer-the-pollution-|title=The rich consume and the poor suffer the pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current [[Constitution of Bolivia]], promulgated in 2009, is the first both ecologic and pro-socialist Constitution in the world, making the Bolivian state officially ecosocialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocon.org/constitution-of/bolivia-2009/ |accessdate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726013753/http://www.ecocon.org/constitution-of/bolivia-2009/ |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosocialist International Network (EIN) and other international eco-socialist organisations===
In 2007, it was announced that attempts to form an [[Ecosocialist International Network]] (EIN) would be made and an inaugural meeting of the International occurred on October 7, 2007 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=InternationalAnnounce&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127193637/http://climateandcapitalism.blogspot.com/2007/06/international-ecosocialist-meeting.html ''Climate and Capitalism'' Blog - ''International Ecosocialist Meeting Planned'']&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting attracted "more than 60 activists from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States" and elected a steering committee featuring representatives from Britain, the United States, Canada, France, Greece, Argentina, Brazil and Australia, including [[Joel Kovel]], [[Michael Löwy]], [[Derek Wall]], [[Ian Angus (activist)|Ian Angus]] (editor of [http://www.climateandcapitalism.com Climate and Capitalism] in Canada) and [[Ariel Salleh]]. The Committee states that it wants "to incorporate members from China, India, Africa, Oceania and Eastern Europe". EIN held its second international conference in January 2009, in association with the next [[World Social Forum]] in Brazil".&lt;ref name=International&gt;[http://www.ecosocialistnetwork.org Ecosocialist International Network Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference released The Belem Ecosocialist Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecosocialistnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

International networking by eco-socialists has already been seen in the [[Praxis Research and Education Center]], a group on international researchers and activists. Based in [[Moscow]] and established in 1997, [[Praxis Research and Education Center|Praxis]], as well as publishing books "by [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], Marxist [[Humanism|humanists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [and] [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]]", running the [[Victor Serge]] Library and opposing [[Second Chechen War|war in Chechnya]], states that it believes "that capitalism has brought life on the planet near to the brink of catastrophe, and that a form of ecosocialism needs to emerge to replace capitalism before it is too late".&lt;ref name=PraxisUSSF&gt;[https://www.ussf2007.org/en/node/2833 United States Social Forum - ''Ecosocialism vs. Capitalist Ecoside: how do we get from here to there?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PraxisRU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praxiscenter.ru|title=Научно-просветительский центр "Праксис"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of capitalist expansion and globalisation==
Merging aspects of [[Marxism]], socialism, [[environmentalism]] and ecology, eco-socialists generally believe that the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]] through [[globalization]] and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures.

In the ''Ecosocialist manifesto'', [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] and [[Michael Löwy|Löwy]] suggest that capitalist expansion causes both "crises of ecology" through "rampant [[industrialization]]" and "societal breakdown" that springs "from the form of imperialism known as globalization". They believe that capitalism's expansion "exposes [[ecosystem]]s" to [[pollutants]], habitat destruction and [[resource depletion]], "reducing the sensuous vitality of [[nature]] to the cold exchangeability required for the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]", while submerging "the majority of the world's people to a mere reservoir of [[Labour (economics)|labor]] power" as it penetrates communities through "[[consumerism]] and depoliticization".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Other eco-socialists, like [[Derek Wall|Wall]], highlight how, in the [[Global South]], [[free-market]] capitalism structures economies to produce [[Cash crop|export-geared crops]] that take water from traditional [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farms]], increasing hunger and the likelihood of [[famine]]; furthermore, forests are increasingly [[Deforestation|cleared]] and [[Enclosure|enclosed]] to produce [[cash crops]] that separate people from their local [[means of production]] and aggravate [[poverty]]. [[Derek Wall|Wall]] shows that many of the world's poor have access to the [[means of production]] through "non-monetised communal [[means of production]]", such as [[subsistence farming]], but, despite providing for need and a level of prosperity, these are not included in conventional economics measures, like [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]].

[[Derek Wall|Wall]] therefore views [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] globalization as "part of the long struggle of the state and commercial interests to steal from those who subsist" by removing "access to the resources that sustain ordinary people across the globe".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; Furthermore, Kovel sees [[neoliberalism]] as "a return to the pure logic of capital" that "has effectively swept away measures which had inhibited capital’s aggressivity, replacing them with naked exploitation of humanity and nature"; for Kovel, this "tearing down of boundaries and limits to accumulation is known as globalization", which was "a deliberate response to a serious accumulation crisis (in the 1970s) that had convinced the leaders of the global economy to install what we know as neoliberalism.".&lt;ref name=KovelNSG&gt;Joel Kovel [http://newsocialist.org/attachments/131_NewSocialist-Issue61.pdf "Why Ecosocialism Today?",] ''New Socialist'', Issue No. 61 (Summer 2007), p.10. Retrieved 13-01-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Juan Martinez-Alier|Martinez-Alier]] blame globalization for creating increased levels of [[waste]] and [[pollution]], and then dumping the [[waste]] on the most vulnerable in society, particularly those in the [[Global South]].&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; Others have also noted that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the [[Global North]] as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the [[environmental justice]] movement in the United States, consisting of [[working-class]] people and [[ethnic minorities]] who highlight the tendency for waste dumps, major road projects and [[incinerator]]s to be constructed around socially excluded areas. However, as [[Derek Wall|Wall]] highlights, such campaigns are often ignored or persecuted precisely because they originate among the most marginalized in society: the [[African-American]] radical green religious group [[MOVE]], campaigning for ecological revolution and [[animal rights]] from [[Philadelphia]], had many members imprisoned or even killed by US authorities from the 1970s onwards.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Eco-socialism disagrees with the elite theories of capitalism, which tend to label a specific [[Social class|class]] or social group as conspirators who construct a system that satisfies their greed and personal desires. Instead, eco-socialists suggest that the very system itself is self-perpetuating, fuelled by "extra-human" or "impersonal" forces. Kovel uses the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal industrial disaster]] as an example. Many [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] observers would blame the avarice of those at the top of many [[Multinational corporation|multi-national corporation]]s, such as the [[Union Carbide]] Corporation in [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal]], for seemingly isolated [[industrial accident]]s. Conversely, Kovel suggests that [[Bhopal disaster|Union Carbide]] were experiencing a decrease in sales that led to falling profits, which, due to [[stock market]] conditions, translated into a drop in share values. The depreciation of share value made many [[shareholders]] sell their stock, weakening the company and leading to cost-cutting measures that eroded the safety procedures and mechanisms at the Bhopal site. Though this did not, in Kovel's mind, make the Bhopal disaster inevitable, he believes that it illustrates the effect [[Free market|market]] forces can have on increasing the likelihood of ecological and social problems.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Use and exchange value===
Eco-socialism focuses closely on [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] posits that, within a [[market economy]], goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods; as we have to keep selling in order to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Such goods, in an eco-socialist analysis, produce [[exchange value]]s but have no [[use value]]. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities - such as caring for relatives full-time and basic [[subsistence]] – are unrewarded, while unnecessary commodities earn individuals huge fortunes and fuel [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The "second contradiction" of capitalism===
[[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]] argues for a "second contradiction" of underproduction, to complement [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s "first" contradiction of capital and labor. While the second contradiction is often considered a theory of environmental degradation, O'Connor's theory in fact goes much further. Building on the work of Karl Polanyi, along with Marx, O'Connor argues that capitalism necessarily undermines the "conditions of production" necessary to sustain the endless accumulation of capital. These conditions of production include soil, water, energy, and so forth. But they also include an adequate public education system, transportation infrastructures, and other services that are not produced directly by capital, but which capital needs in order accumulate effectively. As the conditions of production are exhausted, the costs of production for capital increase. For this reason, the second contradiction generates an underproduction crisis tendency, with the rising cost of inputs and labor, to complement the overproduction tendency of too many commodities for too few customers. Like Marx's contradiction of capital and labor, the second contradiction therefore threatens the system's existence.&lt;ref name=OConnor&gt;O'Connor, J., ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. 2011. "Transcending the Metabolic Rift: A Theory of Crises in the Capitalist World-Ecology," The Journal of Peasant Studies 38(1), 1-46, http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O'Connor believes that, in order to remedy environmental contradictions, the capitalist system innovates new technologies that overcome existing problems but introduce new ones.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt;

O'Connor cites [[nuclear power]] as an example, which he sees as a form of producing energy that is advertised as an alternative to carbon-intensive, non-renewable [[fossil fuels]], but creates long-term [[radioactive waste]] and other dangers to health and security. While O'Connor believes that capitalism is capable of spreading out its economic supports so widely that it can afford to destroy one [[ecosystem]] before moving onto another, he and many other eco-socialists now fear that, with the onset of globalization, the system is running out of new [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt; Kovel adds that capitalist firms have to continue to extract profit through a combination of intensive or extensive exploitation and selling to new markets, meaning that capitalism must [[Economic growth|grow]] indefinitely to exist, which he thinks is impossible on a planet of finite resources.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The role of the state and transnational organisations===
[[capitalism|Capitalist]] expansion is seen by eco-socialists as being "hand in glove" with "corrupt and subservient client states" that repress dissent against the system, governed by [[international organisation]]s "under the overall supervision of the [[Western world|Western powers]] and the [[superpower]] United States", which subordinate peripheral nations economically and militarily.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] further claims that capitalism itself spurs conflict and, ultimately, [[war]]. Kovel states that the '[[War on Terror]]', between [[Islamist extremists]] and the United States, is caused by "oil imperialism", whereby the capitalist nations require control over sources of [[energy]], especially oil, which are necessary to continue intensive [[Economic growth|industrial growth]] - in the quest for control of such resources, Kovel argues that the capitalist nations, specifically the United States, have come into conflict with the predominantly [[Muslim]] nations where oil is often found.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Eco-socialists believe that state or self-[[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of markets does not solve the crisis "because to do so requires setting limits upon accumulation", which is "unacceptable" for a [[Economic growth|growth]]-orientated system; they believe that [[terrorism]] and revolutionary impulses cannot be tackled properly "because to do so would mean abandoning the logic of [[empire]]". Instead, eco-socialists feel that increasing repressive [[counter-terrorism]] increases [[social alienation|alienation]] and causes further [[terrorism]] and believe that state [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] methods are, in Kovel and [[Michael Löwy|Löwy]]'s words, "evolving into a new and malignant variation of [[fascism]]". They echo [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s "stark choice" between "socialism or barbarism", which was believed to be a prediction of the coming of [[fascism]] and further forms of destructive capitalism at the beginning of the twentieth century ([[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]] was in fact murdered by proto-[[Fascism|fascist]] [[Freikorps]] in the revolutionary atmosphere of Germany in 1919).&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Tensions within the eco-socialist discourse==

Reflecting tensions within the environmental and socialist movements, there is some conflict of ideas. In practice however, a synthesis is emerging which calls for democratic regulation of industry in the interests of people and the environment, nationalisation of some key (environmental) industries, local democracy and an extension of co-ops and the library principle.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Scottish Green Peter McColl argues that elected governments should abolish poverty through a Citizens Income scheme, regulate against social and environmental malpractice and encourage environmental good practice through state procurement. At the same time economic and political power should be devolved as far as is possible through co-operatives, and increased local decision making. By putting political and economic power into the hands of the people most likely to be affected by environmental injustice it is less likely that the injustice will take place - see http://www.redflag.org.uk/frontline/frJune08/ecosoc2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of other forms of green politics==
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}
Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green politics|Green movement]] for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], for working within the existing [[Capitalism|capitalist]], [[Statism|statist]] system, for [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], or for reliance on technological fixes. The eco-socialist ideology is based on a critique of other forms of Green politics, including various forms of [[green economics]], [[localism (politics)|localism]], [[deep ecology]], [[bioregionalism]] and even some manifestations of radical green ideologies such as [[eco-feminism]] and [[social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

As Kovel puts it, eco-socialism differs from Green politics at the most fundamental level because the '[[Four Pillars of the Green Party|Four Pillars]]' of Green politics (and the 'Ten Key Values' of the [[Green Party (United States)|US Green Party]]) do not include the demand for the [[emancipation of labour]] and the end of the separation between producers and the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Many eco-socialists also oppose [[Malthusianism]]&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; and are alarmed by the gulf between Green politics in the [[Global North]] and the [[Global South]].&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt;

===Opposition to within-system approaches, voluntarism and technological fixes===
Eco-socialists are highly critical of those Greens who favour "working within the system". While eco-socialists like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] recognise the ability of within-system approaches to raise awareness, and believe that "the struggle for an [[Ecology|ecologically]] rational world must include a struggle for the state", he believes that the mainstream Green movement is too easily co-opted by the current powerful socio-political forces as it "passes from citizen-based [[activism]] to ponderous bureaucracies scuffling for 'a seat at the table'".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

For Kovel, capitalism is "happy to enlist" the Green movement for "convenience", "control over popular dissent" and "rationalization". He further attacks within-system green initiatives like [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]], which he sees as a "capitalist shell game" that turns [[pollution]] "into a fresh source of profit".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[Brian Tokar]] has further criticised carbon trading in this way, suggesting that it augments existing class inequality and gives the "largest 'players'... substantial control over the whole 'game'".&lt;ref name=Tokar&gt;Tokar, B., ''Earth for Sale'', 1997 (Boston:South End Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Kovel criticises the "defeatism" of [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] in some local forms of [[environmentalism]] that do not connect: he suggests that they can be "drawn off into [[individualism]]" or co-opted to the demands of capitalism, as in the case of certain [[recycling]] projects, where citizens are "induced to provide free labor" to [[waste management]] industries who are involved in the "capitalization of nature". He labels the notion on voluntarism "ecopolitics without struggle".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Technological fixes to ecological problems are also rejected by eco-socialists. [[Saral Sarkar]] has updated the thesis of 1970s '[[limits to growth]]' to exemplify the limits of new capitalist technologies such as [[hydrogen fuel cell]]s, which require large amounts of energy to split molecules to obtain hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;Sarkar, S., ''Eco-Socialism or Eco-Capitalism?: A Critical Analysis of Humanity's Fundamental Choices'', 1999 (London:Zed Books)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kovel notes that "events in nature are reciprocal and multi-determined" and can therefore not be predictably "fixed"; socially, technologies cannot solve social problems because they are not "mechanical". He posits an eco-socialist analysis, developed from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], that patterns of production and social organisation are more important than the forms of technology used within a given configuration of society.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Under capitalism, he suggests that technology "has been the ''sine qua non'' of [[Economic growth|growth]]" – thus he believes that, even in a world with hypothetical "free energy", the effect would be to lower the cost of [[automobile]] production, leading to the massive [[overproduction]] of [[vehicle]]s, "collapsing infrastructure", chronic [[resource depletion]] and the "paving over" of the "remainder of [[nature]]". In the modern world, Kovel considers the supposed efficiency of new [[post-industrial]] commodities is a "plain illusion", as [[Miniaturization|miniaturized]] components involve many substances and are therefore non-[[Recycling|recyclable]] (and, theoretically, only simple substances could be retrieved by burning out-of-date equipment, releasing more [[pollutant]]s). He is quick to warn "environmental [[Liberalism|liberals]]" against over-selling the virtues of [[Renewable energy|renewable energies]] that cannot meet the mass energy consumption of the era; although he would still support [[renewable energy]] projects, he believes it is more important to restructure societies to reduce energy use before relying on [[renewable energy]] technologies alone.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of Green economics===
Eco-socialists have based their ideas for political strategy on a critique of several different trends in [[Green economics]]. At the most fundamental level, eco-socialists reject what Kovel calls "[[ecological economics]]" or the "ecological wing of mainstream economics" for being "uninterested in social transformation". He furthers rejects the [[Adam Smith|Neo-Smithian]] school, who believe in [[Adam Smith]]'s vision of "a capitalism of small producers, freely exchanging with each other", which is self-regulating and competitive.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

The school is represented by thinkers like [[David Korten]] who believe in "regulated markets" checked by [[government]] and [[civil society]] but, for Kovel, they do not provide a critique of the expansive nature of capitalism away from localised production and ignore "questions of [[Social class|class]], [[gender]] or any other category of domination". Kovel also criticises their "fairy-tale" view of history, which refers to the abuse of "[[natural capital]]" by the [[materialism]] of the [[Scientific Revolution]], an assumption that, in Kovel's eyes, seems to suggest that "nature had toiled to put the gift of capital into human hands", rather than capitalism being a product of social relations in human history.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Other forms of [[community-based economics]] are also rejected by eco-socialists such as Kovel, including followers of [[E. F. Schumacher]] and some members of the [[cooperative movement]], for advocating "no more than a very halting and isolated first step". He thinks that their principles are "only partially realizable within the institutions of cooperatives in capitalist society" because "the internal cooperation" of cooperatives is "forever hemmed in and compromised" by the need to expand value and compete within the [[Free market|market]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Marx also believed that [[cooperative]]s within capitalism make workers into "their own capitalist... by enabling them to use the [[means of production]] for the employment of their own labour".&lt;ref name=Capital3/&gt;

For Kovel and other eco-socialists, community-based economics and Green [[localism (politics)|localism]] are "a fantasy" because "strict localism belongs to the aboriginal stages of society" and would be an "ecological nightmare at present population levels" due to "heat losses from a multitude of dispersed sites, the squandering of scarce resources, the needless reproduction of effort, and cultural impoverishment". While he feels that small-scale production units are "an essential part of the path towards an ecological society", he sees them not as "an end in itself"; in his view, small enterprises can be either capitalist or [[Socialism|socialist]] in their configuration and therefore must be "consistently anti-capitalist", through recognition and support of the emancipation of labour, and exist "in a dialectic with the whole of things", as human society will need large-scale projects, such as transport infrastructures.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

He highlights the work of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], who exemplifies what eco-socialists see as the good and bad points of [[ecological economics]] — while Daly offers a critique of capitalism and a desire for "workers ownership", he only believes in workers ownership "kept firmly within a capitalist market", ignoring the eco-socialist desire for struggle in the emancipation of labour and hoping that the interests of labour and management today can be improved so that they are "in harmony".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of deep ecology===
Despite the inclusion of both in political factions like the '[[Fundies]]' of the [[German Green Party]], eco-socialists and [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]] hold markedly opposite views. Eco-socialists like Kovel have attacked deep ecology because, like other forms of Green politics and [[Green economics]], it features "virtuous souls" who have "no internal connection with the critique of capitalism and the emancipation of labor". Kovel is particularly scathing about deep ecology and its "fatuous pronouncement" that Green politics is "neither left nor right, but ahead", which, for him, ignores the notion that "that which does not confront the system comes its instrument".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Even more scathingly, Kovel suggests that in "its effort to decentre humanity within nature", deep ecologists can "go too far" and argue for the "splitting away of unwanted people", as evidenced by their desire to preserve [[wilderness]] by removing the groups that have lived there "from [[time immemorial]]". Kovel thinks that this lends legitimacy to "capitalist elites", like the [[US State Department]] and the [[World Bank]], who can make preservation of wilderness a part of their projects that "have added value as sites for [[ecotourism]]" but remove people from their land. Between 1986 and 1996, Kovel notes that over three million people were displaced by "conservation projects"; in the making of the [[US National Parks]], three hundred [[Shoshone]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] were killed in the development of [[Yosemite]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel believes that deep ecology has affected the rest of the Green movement and led to calls from restrictions on [[immigration]], "often allying with reactionaries in a... cryptically [[Racism|racist]] quest".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Indeed, he finds traces of deep ecology in the "biological reduction" of [[Nazism]], an ideology many "organicist thinkers" have found appealing, including [[Herbert Gruhl]], a founder of the German Green Party (who subsequently left when it became more [[left-wing]]) and originator of the phrase "neither left nor right, but ahead". Kovel warns that, while '[[ecofascism]]' is confined to a narrow band of [[far right]] intellectuals and disaffected [[white power skinhead]]s who involved themselves alongside [[far left]] groups in the [[anti-globalization movement]], it may be "imposed as a [[revolution from above]] to install an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime in order to preserve the main workings of the system" in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of bioregionalism===
[[Bioregionalism]], a philosophy developed by writers like [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] who believe in the self-sufficiency of "appropriate bioregional boundaries" drawn up by inhabitants of "an area",&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;Sale, K., 'Principle of Bioregionalism', in Goldsmith, E., and Mander, J. (eds),''The Case against the Global Economy'', Sierra Club Books (San Francisco, CA), 1996&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} has been thoroughly critiqued by [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], who fears that the "vagueness" of the area will lead to conflict and further boundaries between communities.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} While Sale cites the bioregional living of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel notes that such ideas are impossible to translate to populations of modern proportions, and evidences the fact that Native Americans held land in [[commons]], rather than [[private property]] – thus, for eco-socialists, bioregionalism provides no understanding of what is needed to transform society, and what the inevitable "response of the capitalist state" would be to people constructing bioregionalism.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel also attacks the problems of self-sufficiency. Where [[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale]] believes in self-sufficient regions "each developing the energy of its peculiar ecology", such as "wood in the northwest [USA]",&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel asks "how on earth" these can be made sufficient for regional needs, and notes the environmental damage of converting [[Seattle]] into a "forest-destroying and smoke-spewing wood-burning" city. Kovel also questions Sale's insistence on bioregions that do "not require connections with the outside, but within strict limits", and whether this precludes journeys to visit family members and other forms of travel.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of variants of eco-feminism===
Like many variants of socialism and Green politics, eco-socialists recognise the importance of "the gendered bifurcation of nature" and support the emancipation of [[gender]] as it "is at the root of [[patriarchy]] and [[Social class|class]]". Nevertheless, while Kovel believes that "any path out of capitalism must also be [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminist]]", he criticises types of ecofeminism that are not anti-capitalist and can "essentialize women's closeness to nature and build from there, submerging history into nature", becoming more at place in the "comforts of the [[New Age]] Growth Centre". These limitations, for Kovel, "keep ecofeminism from becoming a coherent social movement".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of social ecology===
While having much in common with the radical tradition of [[Social ecology (theory)|Social Ecology]], eco-socialists still see themselves as distinct. [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] believes this is because social ecologists see hierarchy "in-itself" as the cause of [[Ecology|ecological]] destruction, whereas eco-socialists focus on gender and class domination embodied in capitalism and recognise that forms of authority that are not "an expropriation of human power for... self-aggrandizement", such as a student-teacher relationship that is "reciprocal and mutual", are beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In practice, Kovel describes [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] as continuing the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] tradition of [[non-violent direct action]], which is "necessary" but "not sufficient" because "it leaves unspoken the question of building an ecological society beyond capital". Furthermore, Social Ecologists and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] tend to focus on the state alone, rather than the class relations behind state domination (in the view of Marxists). Kovel fears that this is political, springing from historic hostility to [[Marxism]] among anarchists and sectarianism, which he points out as a fault of the "brilliant" but "dogmatic" founder of social ecology, [[Murray Bookchin]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Opposition to Malthusianism and Neo-Malthusianism===
While [[Malthusianism]] and eco-socialism overlap within the Green movement because both address [[Industrialization|over-industrialism]], and despite the fact that Eco-socialists, like many within the Green movement, are described as [[Neo-malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] because of their criticism of [[economic growth]], Eco-socialists are opposed to Malthusianism. This divergence stems from the difference between Marxist and Malthusian examinations of social injustice – whereas Marx blames [[Social inequality|inequality]] on class injustice, [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]] argued that the [[working-class]] remained poor because of their greater [[fertility]] and [[birth rate]]s.

Neo-Malthusians have slightly modified this analysis by increasing their focus on [[overconsumption]] – nonetheless, eco-socialists find this attention inadequate. They point to the fact that Malthus did not thoroughly examine ecology and that [[Garrett Hardin]], a key Neo-Malthusian, suggested that further [[enclosure|enclosed]] and privatised land, as opposed to commons, would solve the chief environmental problem, which Hardin labeled the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

===The "two varieties of environmentalism"===
[[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Juan Martinez-Alier|Martinez-Alier]] attack the gulf between what they see as the two "varieties of [[environmentalism]]" – the environmentalism of the North, an aesthetic environmentalism that is the privilege of wealthy people who no longer have basic material concerns, and the environmentalism of the South, where people's local environment is a source of communal wealth and such issues are a question of survival.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt; Nonetheless, other eco-socialists, such as [[Derek Wall|Wall]], have also pointed out that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the Global North as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the [[environmental justice]] movement in the US and groups like [[MOVE]].&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

==Critique of other forms of socialism==
Eco-socialists choose to use the term '[[socialist]]', despite "the failings of its twentieth century interpretations", because it "still stands for the supersession of [[Capitalism|capital]]" and thus "the name, and the reality" must "become adequate for this time".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Eco-socialists have nonetheless often diverged with other [[Marxist]] movements. Eco-socialism has also been partly influenced by and associated with [[agrarian socialism]] as well as some forms of [[Christian socialism]], especially in the United States.
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}

===Critique of 'Actually Existing Socialisms'===
For Kovel and [[Michael Lowy|Lowy]], eco-socialism is "the realization of the “first-epoch” socialisms" by resurrecting the notion of "free development of all producers", distancing themselves from "the attenuated, reformist aims of [[social democracy]] and the [[Productivism|productivist]] structures of the [[Bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic variations]] of socialism", such as forms of [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} They ground the failure of past [[socialist]] movements in "underdevelopment in the context of hostility by existing [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers", which led to "the denial of internal democracy" and "emulation of capitalist [[productivism]]".&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel believes that the forms of 'actually existing socialism' consisted of "public ownership of the [[means of production]]", rather than meeting "the true definition" of socialism as "a [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]", with the Party-State bureaucracy acting as the "alienating substitute 'public'".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In analysing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Kovel feels that "conspiratorial" revolutionary movements "cut off from the development of society" will "find society an inert mass requiring leadership from above". From this, he notes that the anti-democratic [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] heritage meant that the [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]], who were aided into power by [[World War I|World War One]], were a minority who, when faced with a [[counter-revolution]] and invading [[Western world|Western]] powers, continued "the extraordinary needs of '[[war communism]]'", which "put the seal of [[authoritarianism]]" on the revolution; thus, for Kovel, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] "resorted to terror", shut down the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] (workers' councils) and emulated "capitalist efficiency and [[productivism]] as a means of survival", setting the stage for [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], in Kovel's eyes, came to oppose the nascent [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] [[environmentalism]] and its champion [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]], who was later attacked for "idealism"; Kovel describes [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s philosophy as "a sharply dualistic [[materialism]], rather similar to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] separation of matter and consciousness, and perfectly tooled... to the active working over of the dead, dull matter by the human hand", which led him to want to overcome Russian backwardness through rapid [[industrialization]]. This tendency was, according to Kovel, augmented by a desire to catch-up with the [[Western world|West]] and the "severe crisis" of the revolution's first years.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Furthermore, Kovel quotes [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], who believed in a [[Communism|Communist]] "superman" who would "learn how to move rivers and mountains".&lt;ref name=Trotsky&gt;Trotsky, L., ''Literature and Revolution'', 1924&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Kovel believes that, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s "revolution from above" and mass terror in response to the early 1930s economic crisis, [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s writings "were given official imprimatur", despite the fact that [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] himself was eventually purged, as [[Stalinism]] attacked "the very notion of ecology... in addition to ecologies". Kovel adds that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] "would win the gold medal for enmity to nature", and that, in the face of massive [[environmental degradation]], the inflexible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bureaucracy became increasingly inefficient and unable to emulate capitalist accumulation, leading to a "vicious cycle" that led to its collapse.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Critique of the wider socialist movement===
Beyond the forms of 'actually existing socialism', Kovel criticises [[Socialism|socialists]] in general as treating ecology "as an afterthought" and holding "a naive faith in the ecological capacities of a [[working-class]] defined by generations of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] production". He cites [[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]], who advocates increasing consumption levels under socialism, which, for Kovel, contradicts any notion of natural limits. He also criticises McNally's belief in releasing the "positive side of [[Capitalism|capital]]'s self-expansion"&lt;ref name=McNally&gt;McNally, D., ''Against the Market'', 1993 (London: Verso Books)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} after the emancipation of labor; instead, Kovel argues that a [[socialist]] society would "seek not to become larger" but would rather become "more ''realized''", choosing sufficiency and eschewing [[economic growth]]. Kovel further adds that the [[Socialism|socialist]] movement was historically conditioned by its origins in the era of [[industrialization]] so that, when modern [[Socialism|socialists]] like McNally advocate a socialism that "cannot be at the expense of the range of human satisfaction",&lt;ref name=McNally/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} they fail "to recognize that these satisfactions can be problematic with respect to nature when they have been historically shaped by the domination of nature".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Eco-socialist strategy==
Eco-socialists generally advocate the [[Non-violence|non-violent]] dismantling of capitalism and the state, focusing on collective ownership of the [[means of production]] by freely associated producers and restoration of the [[Commons]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} To get to an eco-socialist society, eco-socialists advocate [[working-class]] [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] resistance but also believe that there is potential for agency in autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups across the world who can build "prefigurative" projects for [[Non-violence|non-violent]] radical social change.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

These prefigurative steps go "beyond the [[Free market|market]] and the state"&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; and base production on the enhancement of [[use value]]s, leading to the internationalization of resistance communities in an 'Eco-socialist Party' or network of grassroots groups focused on [[Non-violence|non-violent]], radical social transformation. An 'Eco-socialist revolution' is then carried out.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}

===Agency===
Many eco-socialists, like Alan Roberts, have encouraged [[working-class]] action and resistance, such as the '[[green ban]]' movement in which workers refuse to participate in projects that are ecologically harmful.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; Similarly, [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] focuses on [[working-class]] involvement in the formation of eco-socialist parties or their increased involvement in existing [[Green Parties]]; however, he believes that, unlike many other forms of [[socialism|socialist]] analysis, "there is no privileged agent" or revolutionary [[Social class|class]], and that there is potential for agency in numerous autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups who can build "prefigurative" projects for [[Non-violence|non-violent]] radical social change. He defines "prefiguration" as "the potential for the given to contain the lineaments of what is to be", meaning that "a moment toward the future exists embedded in every point of the social organism where a need arises".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

If "everything has prefigurative potential", Kovel notes that forms of potential [[Ecology|ecological]] production will be "scattered", and thus suggests that "the task is to free them and connect them". While all "human [[ecosystem]]s" have "ecosocialist potential", Kovel points out that ones such as the [[World Bank]] have low potential, whereas internally democratic [[anti-globalization]] "affinity groups" have a high potential through a dialectic that involves the "active bringing and holding together of negations", such as the group acting as an alternative institution ("production of an [[Ecology|ecological]]/[[Socialism|socialist]] alternative") and trying to shut down a [[G8]] summit meeting ("resistance to capital"). Therefore, "practices that in the same motion enhance [[use-value]]s and diminish [[exchange-value]]s are the ideal" for eco-socialists.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Prefiguration===
For Kovel, the main prefigurative steps "are that people ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system... and that they include in this a consistent attack on the widespread belief that there can be no alternative to it", which will then "deligitimate the system and release people into struggle". Kovel justifies this by stating that "radical criticism of the given... can be a material force", even without an alternative, "because it can seize the mind of the masses of people", leading to "dynamic" and "exponential", rather than "incremental" and "linear", victories that spread rapidly. Following this, he advocates the expansion of the dialectical eco-socialist potential of groups through sustaining the confrontation and internal cohesion of [[human ecosystem]]s, leading to an "activation" of potentials in others that will "spread across the whole social field" as "a new set of orienting principles" that define an ideology or "'party-life' formation".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In the short-term, eco-socialists like Kovel advocate activities that have the "promise of breaking down the commodity form". This includes organizing labor, which is a "reconfiguring of the [[use-value]] of labor power"; forming [[cooperatives]], allowing "a relatively free association of labor"; forming localised currencies, which he sees as "undercutting the value-basis of money"; and supporting "radical media" that, in his eyes, involve an "undoing of the fetishism of commodities". [[Arran Gare]], [[Derek Wall|Wall]] and Kovel have advocated economic [[localism (politics)|localisation]] in the same vein as many in the [[Green politics|Green movement]], although they stress that it must be a prefigurative step rather than an end in itself.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gare2&gt;Gare, A., ''Creating an ecological socialist future'' in ''Capitalism, Nature, Socialism'' 11 (2), 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovel also advises political parties attempting to "democratize the state" that there should be "dialogue but no compromise" with established political parties, and that there must be "a continual association of electoral work with movement work" to avoid "being sucked back into the system". Such parties, he believes, should focus on "the local rungs of the political system" first, before running national campaigns that "challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel believes in building prefigurations around forms of production based on [[use value]]s, which will provide a practical vision of a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Anti-statism|post-statist]] system. Such projects include [[Indymedia]] ("a democratic rendering of the [[use-value]]s of new technologies such as the [[Internet]], and a continual involvement in wider struggle"), [[open-source software]], [[Wikipedia]], [[public libraries]] and many other initiatives, especially those developed within the [[anti-globalisation movement]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} These strategies, in [[Derek Wall|Wall]]'s words, "go beyond the [[Free market|market]] and the state" by rejecting the supposed dichotomy between [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] and [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] production, while also rejecting any combination of the two through a [[mixed economy]]. He states that these present forms of "amphibious politics", which are "half in the dirty water of the present but seeking to move on to a new, unexplored territory".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Wall suggests that [[open source software]], for example, opens up "a new form of [[commons]] regime in [[cyberspace]]", which he praises as production "for the pleasure of invention" that gives "access to resources without exchange". He believes that [[open source]] has "bypassed" both the [[Free market|market]] and the state, and could provide "developing countries with free access to vital computer software". Furthermore, he suggests that an "[[open source]] economy" means that "the barrier between user and provider is eroded", allowing for "cooperative creativity". He links this to [[Marxism]] and the notion of [[usufruct]], asserting that "Marx would have been a [[Firefox]] user".&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

===Internationalization of prefiguration and the 'Eco-socialist Party'===
Many eco-socialists have noted that the potential for building such projects is easier for media workers than for those in heavy industry because of the decline in [[trade unionism]] and the [[Globalization|globalized]] [[division of labor]] which divides workers. However, Kovel believes that examples like the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bruderhof Communities]] (despite elements of [[patriarchy]] that he attacks) show that "communistic" organizations can "survive rather well in a heavily industrialized [[Free market|market]]" if they are "protected" from the dependence on the [[Free market|market]] by "[[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] intentionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further posits that [[class struggle]] is "internationalized in the face of globalization", as evidenced by a wave of [[Strike action|strikes]] across the [[Global South]] in the first half of the year 2000; indeed, he says that "labor's most cherished values are already immanently ecocentric".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Kovel therefore thinks that these universalizing tendencies must lead to the formation of "a consciously 'Ecosocialist Party'" that is neither like a parliamentary or vanguardist party. Instead, Kovel advocates a form of [[political party]] "grounded in communities of resistance", where delegates from these communities form the core of the party's activists, and these delegates and the "open and transparent" assembly they form are subject to [[Recall election|recall]] and regular rotation of members. He holds up the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) and the [[Gaviotas]] movement as examples of such communities, which "are produced outside capitalist circuits" and show that "there can be no single way valid for all peoples".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Nonetheless, he also firmly believes in connecting these movements, stating that "ecosocialism will be international or it will be nothing" and hoping that the Ecosocialist Party can retain the autonomy of local communities while supporting them materially. With an ever-expanding party, Kovel hopes that "defections" by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] will occur, leading eventually to the [[armed forces]] and [[police]] who, in joining the [[revolution]], will signify that "the turning point is reached".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

=='The Revolution' and transition to eco-socialism==
{{One source|section|date=May 2013}}
'The Revolution' as envisaged by eco-socialists involves an immediate socio-political transition. Internationally, eco-socialists believe in a reform of the nature of [[money]] and the formation of a 'World People's Trade Organisation' (WPTO) that democratizes and improves world [[trade]] through the calculation of an 'Ecological Price' (EP) for goods. This would then be followed by a transformation of socioeconomic conditions towards ecological production, [[commons]] land and notions of [[usufruct]] (that seek to improve the common property possessed by society) to end private [[property]]. Eco-socialists assert that this must be carried out with adherence to [[non-violence]]&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===The immediate aftermath of the revolution===
Eco-socialists like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] use the term "Eco-socialist revolution" to describe the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those "whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production" (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those "whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to [[Capitalism|capital]]" (including the [[bourgeoisie]], advertising executives and more) and "the workers whose activity added surplus value to capitalist commodities".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In terms of political organisation, he advocates an "interim assembly" made up of the revolutionaries that can "devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained" (such as short-term continuation of "differential remuneration" for labor), "handle the redistribution of social roles and assets", convene "in widespread locations", and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an "executive council" that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that "productive communities" will "form the political as well as economic unit of society" and "organize others" to make a transition to eco-socialist production.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

He adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with "associate membership" of others, such as a [[Physician|doctor]] having main membership of healthcare communities as a [[Physician|doctor]] and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional "supervisory" roles over localities to monitor the development of [[ecosystem]]ic integrity, and administer "society-wide services" like transport in "state-like functions", before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to "the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Transnational trade and capital reform===
Part of the eco-socialist transition, in Kovel’s eyes, is the reforming [[money]] to retain its use in "enabling exchanges" while reducing its functions as "a commodity in its own right" and "repository of value". He argues for directing [[money]] to "enhancement of [[use-value]]s" through a "subsidization of [[use-value]]s" that "preserves the functioning core of the economy while gaining time and space for rebuilding it". Internationally, he believes in the immediate cessation of [[speculation]] in [[Currency|currencies]] ("breaking down the function of money as commodity, and redirecting funds on [[use-value]]s"), the cancellation of the debt of the [[Global South]] ("breaking the back of the value function" of money) and the redirecting the "vast reservoir of mainly phony value" to reparations and "ecologically sound development". He suggests the end of military aid and other forms of support to "[[comprador elites]] in the [[Global South|South]]" will eventually "lead to their collapse".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In terms of [[trade]], Kovel advocates a ‘World People’s Trade Organization’ (WPTO), "responsible to a confederation of popular bodies", in which "the degree of control over [[trade]] is... proportional to involvement with production", meaning that "farmers would have a special say over food trade" and so on. He posits that the WPTO should have an elected council that will oversee a reform of prices in favour of an ‘Ecological Price’ (EP) "determined by the difference between actual [[use-value]]s and fully realized ones", thus having low [[tariff]]s for forms of ecological production like [[organic agriculture]]; he also envisages the high [[tariff]]s on non-ecological production providing subsidies to ecological production units.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

The EP would also internalize the costs of current [[Externality|externalities]] (like [[pollution]]) and "would be set as a function of the distance traded", reducing the effects of long-distance transport like [[carbon emissions]] and increased [[packaging]] of goods. He thinks that this will provide a "standard of transformation" for non-ecological industries, like the [[automobile industry]], thus spurring changes towards ecological production.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Ecological production===
Eco-socialists pursue "[[ecology|ecological]] production" that, according to [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], goes beyond the [[Socialism|socialist]] vision of the emancipation of labor to "the realization of [[use-value]]s and the appropriation of intrinsic value". He envisions a form of production in which "the making of a thing becomes part of the thing made" so that, using a high quality meal as an analogy, "pleasure would obtain for the cooking of the meal" - thus activities "reserved as hobbies under capitalism" would "compose the fabric of everyday life" under eco-socialism.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This, for Kovel, is achieved if labor is "freely chosen and developed... with a fully realized [[use-value]]" achieved by a "negation" of [[exchange-value]], and he exemplifies the [[Food Not Bombs]] project for adopting this. He believes that the notion of "mutual recognition... for the process as well as the product" will avoid [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[hierarchy]]. With production allowing humanity to "live more directly and receptively embedded in [[nature]]", Kovel predicts that "a reorientation of human need" will occur that recognises [[Ecology|ecological]] limits and sees [[technology]] as "fully participant in the life of [[eco-system]]s", thus removing it from profit-making exercises.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

In the course on an Eco-socialist revolution, writers like Kovel advocate a "rapid conversion to ecosocialist production" for all enterprises, followed by "restoring [[ecosystem]]ic integrity to the workplace" through steps like workers ownership. He then believes that the new enterprises can build "socially developed plans" of production for societal needs, such as efficient light-rail transport components. At the same time, Kovel argues for the transformation of essential but, under capitalism, non-productive labour, such as child care, into productive labour, "thereby giving reproductive labour a status equivalent to productive labour".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

During such a transition, he believes that income should be guaranteed and that money will still be used under "new conditions of value… according to use and to the degree to which ecosystem integrity is developed and advanced by any particular production". Within this structure, Kovel asserts that markets and will become unnecessary – although "market phenomena" in personal exchanges and other small instances might be adopted – and communities and elected assemblies will democratically decide on the allocation of resources.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} [[István Mészáros (professor)|Istvan Meszaros]] believes that such "genuinely planned and self-managed (as opposed to bureaucratically planned from above) productive activities" are essential if eco-socialism is to meet its "fundamental objectives".&lt;ref name=Meszaros&gt;Meszaros, I., ''Beyond Capital'', 1996 (New York:Monthly Review Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-socialists are quick to assert that their focus on "production" does not mean that there will be an increase in production and labor under Eco-socialism. Kovel thinks that the emancipation of labor and the realization of [[use-value]] will allow "the spheres of work and culture to be reintegrated". He cites the example of [[Guarani people|Paraguayan Indian]] communities (organised by [[Jesuits]]) in the eighteenth century who made sure that all community members learned musical instruments, and had labourers take musical instruments to the fields and takes turns playing music or harvesting.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Commons, property and 'usufruct'===
Most eco-socialists, including [[Ramachandra Guha|Guha]] and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Martinez Alier]], echo subsistence [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminists]] like [[Vandana Shiva]] when they argue for the restoration of [[commons]] land over [[private property]]. They blame [[Ecology|ecological]] degradation on the inclination to short-term, profit-inspired decisions inherent within a [[Free market|market]] system. For them, [[privatization]] of land strips people of their local communal resources in the name of creating markets for [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal globalisation]], which benefits a minority. In their view, successful [[commons]] systems have been set up around the world throughout history to manage areas cooperatively, based on long-term needs and [[sustainability]] instead of short-term profit.&lt;ref name=Guha/&gt;

Many eco-socialists focus on a modified version of the notion of ‘[[Usufruct]]’ to replace capitalist private [[property]] arrangements. As a legal term, [[Usufruct]] refers to the legal right to use and derive profit or benefit from [[property]] that belongs to another person, as long as the property is not damaged. According to eco-socialists like Kovel, a modern interpretation of the idea is "where one uses, enjoys – and through that, improves – another’s property", as its [[Latin]] etymology "condenses the two meanings of use – as in [[use-value]], and enjoyment – and as in the gratification expressed in freely associated labour". The idea, according to Kovel, has roots in the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and was first mentioned in [[Roman law]] "where it applied to ambiguities between masters and slaves with respect to property"; it also features in [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia|Sharia law]], [[Aztec#Economy|Aztec]] law and the [[Napoleonic Code]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

Crucially for eco-socialists, Marx mentioned the idea when he stated that human beings are no more than the planet’s "[[usufruct]]aries, and, like ''boni patres familias'', they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition".&lt;ref name=Capital3/&gt; Kovel and others have taken on this reading, asserting that, in an eco-socialist society, "everyone will have... rights of use and ownership over those means of production necessary to express the creativity of human nature", namely "a place of one’s own" to decorate to personal taste, some personal possessions, the body and its attendant sexual and [[reproductive rights]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

However, Kovel sees [[property]] as "self-contradictory" because individuals emerge "in a tissue of social relations" and "nested circles", with the self at the centre and extended circles where "issues of sharing arise from early childhood on". He believes that "the full self is enhanced more by giving than by taking" and that eco-socialism is realized when material possessions weigh "lightly" upon the self – thus restoration of [[use-value]] allows things to be taken "concretely and sensuously" but "lightly, since things are enjoyed for themselves and not as buttresses for a shaky ego".&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

This, for Kovel, reverses what Marxists see as the [[commodity fetishism]] and atomization of individuals (through the "unappeasable craving" for "having and excluding others from having") under capitalism. Under eco-socialism, he therefore believes that enhancement of [[use-value]] will lead to differentiated ownership between the individual and the collective, where there are "distinct limits on the amount of [[property]] individuals control" and no-one can take control of resources that "would permit the alienation of [[means of production]] from another". He then hopes that the "hubris" of the notion of "ownership of the planet" will be replaced with [[usufruct]].&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

===Non-violence===
Most eco-socialists are involved in peace and antiwar movements, and eco-socialist writers, like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]], generally believe that "violence is the rupturing of [[ecosystem]]s" and is therefore "deeply contrary to ecosocialist values". Kovel believes that revolutionary movements must prepare for post-revolutionary violence from counter-revolutionary sources by "prior development of the democratic sphere" within the movement, because "to the degree that people are capable of self-government, so will they turn away from violence and retribution" for "a self-governed people cannot be pushed around by any alien government". It is therefore essential, in [[Joel Kovel|Kovel's]] view, that the revolution "takes place in" or spreads quickly to the United States, which "is capital's gendarme and will crush any serious threat", and that revolutionaries reject the [[death penalty]] and retribution against former opponents or counter-revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}

==Criticisms==
While in many ways the criticisms of eco-socialism combine the traditional criticisms of both socialism and Green politics, there are unique critiques of eco-socialism, which are largely from within the traditional Socialist or Green movements themselves, along with conservative criticisms.

Some socialists are critical of the word 'eco-socialism'. [[David Reilly (Eco-socialist)|David Reilly]], who questions whether his argument is improved by the use of an "exotic word", argues instead that the "real socialism" is "also a green or 'eco'" one that you get to "by dint of struggle".&lt;ref name=LeftClickCritic&gt;[http://leftclickblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/what-is-ecosocialism.html LeftClick Blog: ''What is ecosocialism?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Other socialists, like [[Paul Hampton]] of the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] (a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Third camp|third camp socialist]] party), see eco-socialism as "classless ecology", wherein eco-socialists have "given up on the working class" as the privileged agent of struggle by "borrowing bits from Marx but missing the locus of Marxist politics".&lt;ref name=AWLCritic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/8390|title=Joel Kovel meeting - why I'm sceptical about "eco-socialism"|first=|last=PaulHampton|date=28 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]]'', [[Doug Boucher]], [[Peter Caplan]], [[David Schwartzman]] and [[Jane Zara]] criticise eco-socialists in general (and Joel Kovel in particular) for a deterministic "[[catastrophism]]" that overlooks "the countervailing tendencies of both popular struggles and the efforts of capitalist governments to rationalize the system" and the "accomplishments of the [[labor movement]]" that "demonstrate that despite the interests and desires of capitalists, progress toward [[social justice]] is possible". They argue that an ecological socialism must be "built on hope, not fear".&lt;ref name=CNSCritics&gt;[http://www.dccofc.org/Documents/Review%20of%20Kovel.htm ''Capitalism Nature Socialism'' September 2003 - ''Another look at the end of the world''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112173453/http://www.dccofc.org/Documents/Review%20of%20Kovel.htm |date=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatives have criticised the perceived opportunism of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] groups who have increased their focus on green issues since the fall of [[communism]]. [[Fred L. Smith (political writer)|Fred L. Smith]] Jr., President of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] think-tank, exemplifies the conservative critique of left Greens, attacking the "[[pantheism]]" of the Green movement and conflating "[[neopaganism|eco-paganism]]" with eco-socialism. Like many conservative critics, Smith uses the term 'eco-socialism' to attack non-socialist [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] for advocating restrictions on the market-based solutions to ecological problems. He nevertheless wrongly claims that eco-socialists endorse "the Malthusian view of the relationship between man and nature", and states that [[Al Gore]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Vice President of the United States]] and now a [[climate change]] campaigner, is an eco-socialist, despite the fact that [[Al Gore|Gore]] has never used this term and is not recognised as a such by other followers of either Green politics or socialism.&lt;ref name=SmithCritic&gt;[http://www.policycounsel.org/46101/48601.html Policy Counsel - ''Eco-Paganism - Eco-socialism: Severe Threats to America's Future'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmentalists and [[Conservation movement|conservation]]ists have criticised eco-socialism from within the Green movement. In a review of Joel Kovel's ''The Enemy of Nature'', [[David M. Johns]] criticises eco-socialism for not offering "suggestions about near term [[Conservation movement|conservation]] policy" and focusing exclusively on long-term societal transformation. Johns believes that [[species extinction]] "started much earlier" than capitalism and suggests that eco-socialism neglects the fact that an [[Ecology|ecological]] society will need to transcend the destructiveness found in "all large-scale societies".&lt;ref name=NPSCritic&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cnps/2003/00000025/00000001/art00009?crawler=true|title=Reviews Editor's Introduction|first=JOHN C.|last=BERG|date=1 March 2003|journal=New Political Science|volume=25|issue=1|pages=129–143|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/0739314032000071262}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very tendency that Kovel himself attacks among capitalists and traditional leftists who attempt to reduce nature to "linear" human models.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} Johns questions whether non-hierarchical social systems can provide for billions of people, and criticises eco-socialists for neglecting issues of [[Over-population|population pressure]]. Furthermore, Johns describes Kovel's argument that human hierarchy is founded on raiding to steal women as "archaic".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

{{Fascism sidebar}}
As there have been many different manifestations of [[fascism]], especially during the interwar years, there were also many different symbols of fascist movements. Fascist symbolism typically involved [[nationalism|nationalist]] imagery.

==Common symbolism of fascist movements==
Organized fascist movements have [[militarist]]-appearing uniforms for their members; use national symbols, historical symbols of a nation as symbols of their movement; and use orchestrated rallies for [[propaganda]] purposes. Fascist movements are led by a "Leader" (i.e. ''[[Duce]]'', ''[[Führer]]'', ''[[Caudillo]]'' and so on) who is publicly idolized in propaganda as the nation's saviour. A number of fascist movements use a [[Roman salute|straight-armed salute]].

The use of symbols, graphics, and other artifacts created by fascist, [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments has been noted as a key aspect of their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heller |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Heller (graphic design) |title=Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State |year=2008|publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |location= |isbn=0-7148-4846-8|page=240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Fascist movements adopted symbols of Ancient Roman or Greek origin, for example the German use of Roman standards during rallies, the Italian adoption of the ''[[fasces]]'' symbol, the Spanish "[[Falange]]" from the Spanish word for "Phalanx".

==Italy==
[[File:Flag of the National Fascist Party (PNF).svg|left|thumb|Flag of the National Fascist Party, bearing the fasces, which was the premier symbol of Italian Fascism.]]
[[File:Fascist Eagle.svg|right|thumb|200px|A perched eagle clutching a fasces was a common symbol used on Italian Fascist uniforms.]]
The original symbol of fascism, in Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], was the [[fasces]]. This is an ancient [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] symbol of power carried by [[lictor]]s in front of [[magistrate]]s; a bundle of sticks featuring an [[axe]], indicating the power over [[life]] and [[death]]. Before the Italian Fascists adopted the fasces, the symbol had been used by Italian political organizations of various political ideologies (ranging from socialist to nationalist), called [[Fascio]] ("leagues") as a symbol of strength through unity.

Italian Fascism utilized the color [[black]] as a symbol of their movement, black being the color of the uniforms of their paramilitaries, known as [[Blackshirts]]. The blackshirt derived from Italy's daredevil elite [[shock troops]] known as the ''[[Arditi]]'', soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms.&lt;ref name=rg207&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Fascism and culture. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour black as used by the Arditi, symbolized death.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Oxon, England, UK: Digital Printing, 2005. Pp. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist Italy was not officially racist, unlike its World War II Axis partner of [[Nazi Germany]]. But it equally gave importance to the purity of race, as Mussolini at multiple times expressed alarm towards a possible extinction of white people. Consolidation of gained territory in the northeast of Italy led to state-sanctioned persecution and ethnic cleansing of [[Slovenes]], while closer ties with Hitler caused Mussolini to collaborate in sending Italian Jews to die in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/nyregion/05italians.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]] (Italy), Mussolini stated, "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]".&lt;ref name=nm35&gt;Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was concerned with the low birth rates of the [[white race]] in contrast to the African and Asian races. In 1928, he noted the high birth-rate of blacks in the United States, and that they had surpassed the population of whites in certain areas, such as Harlem in New York City. He described their greater racial consciousness in comparison with American whites as contributing to their growing strength.&lt;ref name=ag43&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symbols used by the Italian Fascists included the ''[[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]]'', the [[Capitoline Wolf]], and the [[SPQR]] motto, each related to Italy's ancient Roman cultural history, which the Fascists attempted to resurrect.

==Germany==

[[File:Parteiadler_der_Nationalsozialistische_Deutsche_Arbeiterpartei_(1933–1945)_(andere).svg|right|thumb|200px|NSDAP Parteiadler eagle variant]]
The nature of German fascism, as encapsulated in [[Nazism]] was similar to Italian Fascism ideologically and borrowed symbolism from the Italian Fascists such as the use of mass rallies, the straight-armed [[Roman salute]], and the use of pageantry. Nazism was different from Italian Fascism in that it was officially [[racism|racist]]. Its symbol was the [[swastika]], at the time a commonly seen symbol in the world that had experienced a [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|revival in use in the western world in the early 20th century]]. German [[Völkisch movement|völkisch Nationalists]] claimed the swastika was a symbol of the [[Aryan race]], who they claimed were the foundation of Germanic civilization and were superior to all other races.

As the Italian Fascists adapted elements of their ethnic heritage to fuel a sense of Nationalism by use of symbolism, so did Nazi Germany. Turn-of-the-century [[Germanic mysticism|German-Austrian mystic]] and author [[Guido von List]] was a big influence on [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]], who introduced various ancient Germanic symbols (filtered through von List's writings) most thoroughly into the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], including the stylized double [[Sig Rune]] (von List's then-contemporary [[Armanen runes|Armanen rune]] version of the ancient ''[[sowilo]]'' [[runic alphabet|rune]]) for the organization itself.

The black-white-red tricolor of the [[German Empire]] was utilized as the color scheme of the Nazi flag. The color [[brown]] was the identifying color of Nazism (and fascism in general), due to it being the color of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] paramilitaries (also known as [[Brownshirts]]).

Other historical symbols that were already in use by the German Army to varying degrees prior to the Nazi Germany, such as the [[Wolfsangel]] and [[Totenkopf]], were also used in a new, more industrialized manner on uniforms and insignia.

Although the swastika was a popular symbol in art prior to the regimental use by [[Nazi Germany]] and has a long heritage in many other cultures throughout history - and although many of the symbols used by the Nazis were ancient or commonly used prior to the advent of Nazi Germany - because of association with Nazi use, the swastika is often considered synonymous with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and some of the other symbols still carry a negative post-[[World War II]] stigma in some Western countries, to the point where some of the symbols are banned from display altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/24/germany_banned_its_ugly_historic_symbols_should_we_do_that_too.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{see also|Symbols of Francoism}}
[[File:Bandera FE JONS.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Spanish Falange, bearing the yoke and arrows, the premier symbol of Falangism.]]
The fascist [[Falange]] in Spain utilized the [[yoke and arrows]] as their symbol. It historically served as the symbol of the shield of the monarchy of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] and subsequent [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] monarchs, representing a united Spain and the "symbol of the heroic virtues of the race".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Parkins. ''Fashioning the body politic: dress, gender, citizenship''. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2002. Pp. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The original uniform of the ''Falangistas'' was the blue shirt – derived from the blue overalls of industrial workers – which was later combined with the red [[beret]] of the [[Carlism|Carlists]] to represent their merger by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

==Militarist uniforms with nationalist insignia==
[[Image:Mussolini young.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in uniform.]]
Organized fascist movements typically use military-like uniforms with the symbol of their movement on them.
[[Image:Hitler Mannerheim.png|thumb|100px|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] in uniform.]]
In Italy, the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 wore black military-like uniforms, and were nicknamed [[Blackshirts]]. In power, uniforms during the Fascist era extended to both the party and the military which typically bore ''fasces'' or an eagle clutching a ''fasces'' on their caps or on the left arm section of the uniform.

In Germany, the fascist Nazi movement was similar to the Italian Fascists in that they initially used a specifically colored uniform for their movement, the tan-brown colored uniform of the SA paramilitary group earned the group and the Nazis themselves the nickname of the Brownshirts. The Nazis used the swastika for their uniforms and copied the Italian Fascists' uniforms, with an eagle clutching a wreathed swastika instead of a fasces, and a Nazi flag arm sash on the left arm section of the uniform for party members.

Other fascist countries largely copied the symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark blue shirts for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore blue shirts. Berets were also used, representing their [[Carlist]] supporters. The Spanish [[Blue Division]] expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WW2 in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore blue shirts, berets and their army trousers.

==Other regions==
[[File:Ustaše symbol.svg|thumb|right|100px|Symbol of the Croatian [[Ustaše]].]]
Many other fascist movements did not win power or were relatively minor regimes in comparison and their symbolism is not well-remembered today in many parts of the world, although the BUF's [[Flash and Circle]] was later used by the non-fascist [[People's Action Party]] of [[Singapore]].

* The symbol of the [[Bulgaria]]n national-socialist [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] movements was a [[sun cross]] named "Bogar".
* Lightning bolts were a common symbol of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]], appearing on uniforms, newspaper mastheads, badges and on the movement's flags. The symbol completely replaced the fasces used from 1932 to 1935 with the adoption of the [[Flash and Circle]].
* The symbol of the [[Croatia]]n [[Ustaše]] movement was capital letter U with the flaming grenade and the [[Coat of arms of Croatia|Croatian coat of arms]].
* A prominent symbol of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[4th of August Regime]] was the [[Labrys]]/Pelekys, the double-headed axe which [[Ioannis Metaxas]] thought to be the oldest symbol of all Hellenic civilizations.
* The symbol of [[Hungary]]'s fascistic [[Arrow Cross Party]] was the [[Arrow Cross]].
* Austria's [[Fatherland's Front (Austria)|Fatherland's Front]], that ruled the country from 1933 to 1938, used the [[crutch cross]] as its symbol.
* The symbol of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Nasjonal Samling]] was as golden/yellow [[sun cross]] on red background.
* The symbol of [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was a stylized version of the [[Armillary sphere]] and shield found on the national flag; its rivals in the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista]] used the [[Order of Christ Cross]].
* The symbol of the [[Romania]]n [[Iron Guard]] was a triple [[cross]] (a variant of the triple parted and fretted) – three parallel verticals intersected with three parallel horizontals, usually in black; it was meant to represent prison bars, as a badge of [[martyr]]dom. It was sometimes deemed the ''[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] Cross'', after the [[patron saint]] of the movement.
* The [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB) used the [[Wolfsangel]] as its main symbol.
* The [[Brazilian Integralist Action]] used an upper case [[sigma]] (Σ), to represent the [[summation]] of all things under the State.
* The Russian [[Movement Against Illegal Immigration]], which is often considered to be a moderate and legal neo-Nazi movement, uses the black-colored road sign "Stop Prohibited" (similar to the swastika) as their main symbol.
*The quasi-Fascist [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Yugoslav National Movement|ZBOR]] used a green shield with a blade of wheat on it, with a sword crossing the shield.

==Contemporary usage==
[[File:Neo-Nazi celtic cross flag.svg|thumb|[[Celtic cross]] on a Neo-Nazi flag]]
Some [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organizations continue to use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some [[neo-fascist]] groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke nationalistic sentiment but do not carry the same racist connotations.

==Pejorative symbolism==
Opponents of fascism have identified symbols seen in a pejorative manner such as the [[jackboot]].

==Non-fascist usage==
[[File:Swastik on head.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hindu]] boy with swastika painted on his shaven head as a religious rite]]
Some of these symbols are also used by a variety of non-fascist movements and organizations. The swastika has been a notable symbol in [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], as well as in modern pagan religions, such as in [[Germanic neopaganism]]. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) states:
{{quote|Nazi Germany glorified an idealized "Aryan/Norse" heritage, consequently extremists have appropriated many symbols from pre-Christian Europe for their own uses. They give such symbols a racist significance, even though the symbols did not originally have such meaning and are often used by nonracists today, especially practitioners of [[modern paganism|modern pagan religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/Pagan_graphics.asp adl.org], accessed 19 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fasces are used in the [[national emblem of France]], the coat of arms and [[wordmark]] of the Swedish Police and the [[Swedish Security Service]], the coat of arms of the Swiss [[Canton of St. Gallen]], and the coat of arms of the Spanish Civil Guard.

'''Fractionalism''' is the [[System of government|government system]] that is the closest to a [[confederation]] but differs when the [[market system]] is a central market owned mostly by the government and very little by the people, yet the people have more control over it than the control of the government. This is possible by the fact that in fractionalism, the central government, on the federal level, is made up of several levels to ensure the utmost security for the people's government.

The whole nation is broken down into several small city-states. The national government cannot intervene in any acts that the city-state chooses to enforce unless it could weaken the unity of the country as a whole. Other than that, the national government cannot intervene unless there is an almost guaranteed economic collapse in the city state, a widespread famine or biological plague, or other state of emergencies declared by that city state. However, in the case of war, the national military can inhabit any city state without the need to ask permission of any form of state or local government.

A '''government district''' or '''government area''' is any part of a city or town in which the primary land use by state institutions ([[national legislature]], [[official residences]]s, [[foreign ministry headquarters]], and so on), as opposed to a [[residential neighbourhood]], [[commercial district]] and [[industrial park|industrial zone]], or other types of [[neighborhood]]s. In some cities, authorities use planning or [[zoning]] laws to define the boundaries of government districts.

In most national and many sub-national (state, provincial, etc.) [[capital cities]] there are distinct government districts centred on the [[national legislature]].  However, non-capitals may also have an administrative district centered on city hall or a government office building.

== Examples ==

=== Canada ===
In the national capital, [[Ottawa]], the main government district, centered on [[Parliament Hill]] is within [[Downtown Ottawa]] (part of [[Centretown]]), but could be extended to include small parts of [[Lower Town]] and [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]] if the prime minister's and government general's residences are included, as well as the district of [[Hull, Quebec]] in the neighboring city of [[Gatineau]] where several ministries are headquartered.  These areas are all linked by the ceremonial route known as "[[Confederation Boulevard]]".

In Quebec City, the provincial capital of Quebec, the ''[[Complexe du Parlement]]'' (including the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]]) and several other government buildings, are located within the neighborhood of [[Parliament Hill (Quebec City)|Parliament Hill]].  This is within the districts of [[Vieux-Québec—Cap-Blanc—colline Parlementaire]] and [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Quebec City|Saint-Jean-Baptiste]], which are themselves in the borough of [[La Cité-Limoilou]].

Toronto, Ontario's government district is centered on [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] home of the provincial parliament.

Edmonton Alberta's main government district, is centered on Capital Boulevard ([[107 Street, Edmonton|107 Street]] south of [[Jasper Avenue]]) which is home to the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] and the [[Federal Public Building]].  However [[Edmonton City Hall]] and [[Canada Place (Edmonton)|Canada Place]] anchor another government cluster to the east.

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Istjude''''', in the [[Nazi]] jargon, was a person with at least three ethnic [[Jews|Jewish]] grandparents. 

''Istjuden'' were legally equated with the so-called ''[[Geltungsjude]]n'' (''gelten'' = to be considered as, ''ist'' = is).

'''Italian irredentism in Switzerland''' was a political movement that promoted the unification to [[Italy]] of the Italian-speaking areas of [[Switzerland]] during the [[Risorgimento]].

==History==

In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian speaking people created the [[Italian irredentism]].

In southern Switzerland those ideals were minimally followed until the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 and up to [[World War I]].

Following the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]], however, the initial moderate irredentism started to change to one full of aggression: the same [[Benito Mussolini]] created in the early 1930s the ''Partito Fascista Ticinese'' (Ticino Fascist Party).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml Fra Roma e Berna, di Mauro Cerutti (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830110602/http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main ideal of this party was to bring the Italian frontier up to the [[Gotthard Pass|Gottardo Pass]] (''Catena mediana delle Alpi'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/img-schede/8-img1.jpg Map of "Catena mediana delle Alpi" as possible northern Italian border in Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;)  in the Alps through political unrest and possible referendums (supported, in case of need, by the Italian Army).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/studenti.cfm?target=8|title=Italia-Svizzera: la storia dal 1861 al 2011|first=Contechnet.it massimo|last=rossi|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 was done a small tentative by the Ticino fascists: the March on Bellinzona", similar to the [[March on Rome]]. But it was successfully contrasted by socialist organizations, like "Liberi e Svizzeri" of Guglielmo Canevascini, promoted even by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cerutti, Fra Roma e Berna. La Svizzera italiana nel ventennio fascista, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successively, in the 1935 elections the fascists obtained just 2% of the votes and since then their movement faded away to less than 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wArTkIKE7WAC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7NuGyUtLJ&amp;sig=B8Mka8gIAdIpIFTalz1R9NVqWDk&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=UUmFTNraH5qKnAe4v5yTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;f=false|title=Il cattolicesimo ticinese e i fascismi: la Chiesa e il partito conservatore ticinese nel periodo tra le due guerre mondiali|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Saint-Paul|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Italian areas called "irredente" in 1918. Ticino in green]]
Before [[World War II]] the Italian irredentism in Switzerland was reduced to have followers mainly between the descendants of Italians emigrated to Ticino at the end of the 19th century, but was ruled and promoted by a small group of ticino intellectuals with their active newspapers and propaganda.

The most important of these intellectuals was Teresina Bontempi, who created the magazine ''L'Adula''.  She denounced in her writings, together with Rosetta Colombi, the [[germanization]] of Canton Ticino promoted by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps-ticino.ch/sonvico/mondo/pubblicazioni/Crespi,Ticino%20irredento04.htm  Il sogno irredentista del Ticino (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the German speaking population in Canton Ticino went from  2.6%  in 1837 to 5.34% in 1920 and nearly 10% in 1940.

As a consequence of this political activity she was involved in continuous problems with the Swiss government, that finally jailed her in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ilse Shneiderfranken.Le industrie del Canton Ticino. Belinzona, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to move to Italy as a political refugee after some months.

The most renowned fascist born in Canton Ticino was Aurelio Garobbio, who tried to imitate [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] with his organization called ''Giovani Ticinesi''.&lt;ref&gt;Garobbio, Aurelio. ''Gabriele D'Annunzio e i «Giovani Ticinesi»: le vicende de «L'Adula»'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After 1935 Garobbio was the main responsible of the Italian irredentism in Switzerland and was with Mussolini until his death in spring 1945, when tried to organize a last fascist area of defense in [[Valtellina]] next to Ticino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m_xg6W8oGUC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eL5Ipaj9P7&amp;sig=Pn59UpC7B2OtcpxsUeI5toJj08I&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=RG2FTKqQHNOfnQeG4ZTxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;f=false|title=Com'era rossa la mia valle: una storia di antiresistenza in Valtellina|first=Giuseppe|last=Rocco|date=1 January 1992|publisher=GRECO &amp; GRECO Editori|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Justice Party USA''' is a [[Political parties in the United States|political party]] in the [[United States]]. It was organized in November 2011 by a group of political activists including former [[Mayor of Salt Lake City]] [[Rocky Anderson]] as an alternative to what he saw as a [[duopoly]] of the [[Political parties in the United States|two major political parties]]. One of the major goals of the Justice Party is removing corporate influence and other concentrated wealth from politics.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;Romboy, Dennis [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705395124/Rocky-Anderson-forms-Justice-Party-plans-to-run-for-president.html "Rocky Anderson forms Justice Party, plans to run for president"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', November 30, 2011.

It was the fifth largest third party in terms of presidential ballot access in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Winger, Richard (October 1, 2012) [http://www.ballot-access.org/2012/10/27/ballot-access-news-october-2012-print-edition/ "2012 Ballot Status for President"] ''Ballot Access News''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8793">{{About|the concept of liberal paternalism, which is sometimes described as a form of soft paternalism|other uses of "soft paternalism"|paternalism}}

'''Libertarian paternalism''' is the idea that it is both possible and legitimate for private and public institutions to affect behavior while also respecting freedom of choice, as well as the implementation of that idea. The term was coined by behavioral economist [[Richard Thaler]] and legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] in a 2003 article in the ''American Economic Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Richard and Sunstein, Cass. 2003. "Libertarian[sic!] Paternalism". ''The American Economic Review'' 93: 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors further elaborated upon their ideas in a more in-depth article published in the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass; Thaler, Richard. 2003. "Libertarian Paternalism is Not an Oxymoron". ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 70(4): 1159–202.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that libertarian paternalism is [[paternalism]] in the sense that "it tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves" (p. 5); note and consider, the concept paternalism specifically requires a restriction of choice. It is [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in the sense that it aims to ensure that "people should be free to opt out of specified arrangements if they choose to do so" (p. 1161). The possibility to opt-out is said to "preserve freedom of choice" (p. 1182). Thaler and Sunstein published ''Nudge'', a book-length defense of this political doctrine, in 2008 (new edition 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Sunstein, C.R. 2009. ''[[Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness]]''. 2d edition. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Libertarian paternalism is similar to asymmetric paternalism, which refers to policies designed to help people who behave irrationally and so are not advancing their own interests, while interfering only minimally with people who behave rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Camerer, Samuel Issacharoff, George Loewenstein, Ted O’Donoghue &amp; Matthew Rabin. 2003. "Regulation for Conservatives: Behavioral Economics and the Case for “Asymmetric Paternalism”. 151 ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' 101: 1211–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such policies are also asymmetric in the sense that they should be acceptable both to those who believe that people behave rationally and to those who believe that people often behave irrationally.

==Examples of policies==
Setting the default in order to exploit the [[default effect]] is a typical example of a soft paternalist policy. Countries that have an "opt-out" system for voluntary [[Organ donation#Opt-in vs. opt-out|organ donation]] (anyone who did not explicitly refuse to donate their organs in the case of accident is considered a donor) experience dramatically higher levels of organ donation consent, than countries with an opt-in system. [[Austria]], with an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%, while [[Germany]], with a very similar culture and economic situation, but an opt-in system, has a consent rate of only 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |title=Opting In vs. Opting Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=4 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68tvQex6c?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html?_r=1 |archivedate= 4 July 2012 |date=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cab drivers in [[New York City]] have seen an increase in tips from 10% to 22% after passengers had the ability to pay using credit cards on a device installed in the cab whose screen presented them with three default tip options, ranging from 15% to 30%.&lt;ref name="NYCcabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/nyregion/08taxi.html|title=New York’s Cabbies Like Credit Cards? Go Figure|author=Michael M. Grynbaum|date=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the default contribution rate for most tax-deferred retirement savings plans in the [[United States]] was zero, and despite the enormous tax advantages, many people took years to start contributing if they ever did. [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral economists]] attribute this to the "[[status quo bias]]", the common human resistance to changing one's behavior, combined with another common problem: the tendency to [[procrastination|procrastinate]].  Research by behavioral economists demonstrated, moreover, that firms which raised the default rate instantly and dramatically raised the contribution rates of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Benartzi, S. 2004. "Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving". ''Journal of Political Economy'' 112:164–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising default contribution rates is also an example of asymmetric paternalism. Those who are making an informed deliberate choice to put aside zero percent of their income in tax deferred savings still have this option, but those who were not saving simply out of inertia or due to procrastination are helped by higher default contribution rates.  It is also asymmetric in the second sense: If you do not believe that defaults matter, because you believe that people will make rational decisions about something as important as retirement saving, then you should not care about the default rate. If you believe that defaults matter, on the other hand, you should want to set defaults at the level that you believe will be best for the largest number of people.

==Criticism of the choice of term==
There has been much criticism of the ideology behind the term, ''libertarian paternalism''. For example, it has been argued that it fails to appreciate the traditional libertarian concern with [[coercion]] in particular, and instead focuses on freedom of choice in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. 2004. "Statist Quo Bias" ''Economic Journal Watch'' 1: 260–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that, while libertarian paternalism aims to promote wellbeing, there may be more libertarian aims that could be promoted, such as maximizing future liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Gregory. 2004–2005. "Libertarian Paternalism Is an Oxymoron" ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 99: 1245–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a chronological list of political catchphrases throughout the history of the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. This is not necessarily a list of historical quotes, but phrases that have been commonly referenced or repeated within various political contexts.

==19th-century==
*"We are all Republicans – we are all federalists", [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s First Inaugural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH35/onuf1.html Thomas Jefferson, Federalist Papers.

*"Our Federal Union. It must be preserved", toast famously made by [[Andrew Jackson]] during a formal gala commemorating Thomas Jefferson's birthday on April 13, 1830.

This is a '''list of people declared ''persona non grata'''''. ''[[Persona non grata]]'' ([[Latin]], [[plural]]: ''personae non gratae''), literally meaning "an unwelcome person", is a legal term used in [[diplomacy]] that indicates a proscription against a foreign person entering or remaining in the country. It is the most serious form of censure that one country can apply to foreign diplomats, who are otherwise protected by [[diplomatic immunity]] from [[arrest]] and other normal kinds of prosecution.

* The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 included the list of [[150 personae non gratae of Turkey|150 ''personae non gratae'' of Turkey]], which forbade the entry of mainly a group of former [[Ottoman Empire]] officials and about 100 other persons to [[Turkey]], until the lifting of this status in 1938.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

* [[Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain]] was obliged to leave Italy in 1942 having become ''persona non grata'' to the Italian government. According to [[Harold Tittmann]], a United States representative at the Vatican at the time, this was due to her "ill-disguised leanings to the Allied cause."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Tittmann, ''Inside the Vatican of Pius XI'', p. 32, Image book, Doubleday, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harald Edelstam]], Swedish ambassador to Chile, was declared ''persona non grata'' for his efforts to hide and assist members of the opposition facing persecution by the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|Chilean junta]] of 1973–1990, including occupying the Embassy of [[Cuba]] in [[Santiago]], containing hundreds of refugees, and declaring it Swedish soil.
* [[Kurt Waldheim]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and [[President of Austria]], and his wife were given ''persona non grata'' status in the United States and other countries when he was accused of having known about [[Nazi war crime]]s and not having done anything about them.&lt;ref name="waldheim1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/kurt_waldheim/index.html |title=Kurt Waldheim |access-date=January 1, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=Serge|last=Schmemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 1952, the American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, [[George F.

Mithoefer Jr, who had accompanied him on his visit, were both barred from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19760315&amp;id=sP0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YuUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6878,2150846|title=Snub snaps U.S. ties with Equatorial Guinea|work=Lawrence Journal-World|date=March 15, 1976|access-date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 1990s, [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], who would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], was "''persona non grata'' in [[Peru]], discredited and insulted in the official press" of [[Alberto Fujimori]]'s regime. According to [[Ilan Stavans]], "Peruvians have made it a sport to hate Vargas Llosa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Maya Jaggi|first=Maya|last=Jaggi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/16/fiction.books?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fiction and hyper-reality|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 16, 2002|quote="During Fujimori's first two years I was very discreet," he says. "But I've been against dictatorships all my life. My situation became very difficult: I was persona non grata in Peru, discredited and insulted in the official press&amp;nbsp;— Fujimori controlled everything.

Generally, a '''local administrative unit (LAU)''' is a low level [[administrative division]] of a country, ranked below a [[province]], [[region]], or [[State (administrative division)|state]].  Not all countries describe their locally governed areas this way, but it can be descriptively applied anywhere to refer to counties, municipalities, etc.

In the [[European Union]], LAUs are basic components of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions. For each [[Member of the European Union|EU member country]], two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) are defined: LAU 1 and LAU 2, which were previously called NUTS 4 and NUTS 5 respectively, until the NUTS regulation went into force in July 2003. For some countries, the LAU 1 level is not defined, and thus equivalent to the NUTS 3 level. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]].

In [[philosophy]], '''meta-rights''' are the [[entitlement]]s of individuals to their [[rights]], including the possibility to [[waive]], transfer or sell their rights. When we talk of the rights of individuals, we do not always distinguish between rights which can be waived or sold and rights which are non-negotiable. Yet that distinction and often the distinction is made implicitly. When we say a person has a right to her house, we usually mean that she also has the meta right to sell the right. On the other hand, when we say a person has the right to his body parts, we usually assume this comes without the accompanying meta right to sell these rights. Economic efficiency usually comes with having rights which come together with the meta right to sell the right. It is arguable that we should be much more explicit about when rights come together with meta rights and when without, and the moral basis that accompany these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaushik Basu |title=The right to give up rights |journal=Economica |volume=51 |year=1984|doi=10.2307/2554226 |jstor=2554226 |pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/basic-rights-and-meta-rights#axzz2SSpJJAeL&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades that followed, the use of the term "neoliberal" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more ''laissez-faire'' doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a [[market economy]] under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the [[social market economy]].

In the 1960s, usage of the term "neoliberal" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Economic history of Chile#"Neoliberal" reforms (1973–90)|economic reforms]] in [[Chile]], the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism|capitalist]] set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of [[Mont Pelerin Society]] economists [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], along with politicians and policy-makers such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Alan Greenspan]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Springer|editor1-first= Simon |editor2-last= Birch|editor2-first= Kean |editor3-last= MacLeavy|editor3-first= Julie|date= 2016 |title= The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Handbook-of-Neoliberalism/Springer-Birch-MacLeavy/p/book/9781138844001|location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3] |isbn= 978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; By 1994, with the passage of [[NAFTA]] and with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' reaction to this development in [[Chiapas]], the term entered global circulation.&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="Handbookscholarship"/&gt;

==Terminology==

===Origins===
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
An early use of the term in English was in 1898 by the French economist [[Charles Gide]] to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gide|first=Charles|date=1898-01-01|title=Has Co-operation Introduced a New Principle into Economics?|jstor=2957091|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=8|issue=32|pages=490–511|doi=10.2307/2957091}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term "néo-libéralisme" previously existing in French,&lt;ref name="OxfordNeoliberalism"/&gt; and the term was later used by others including the classical liberal economist [[Milton Friedman]] in a 1951 essay.&lt;ref name="Burgin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Burgin|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&amp;pg=PA170|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]], the term "neoliberalism" was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving "the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state".&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} To be "neoliberal" meant advocating a modern economic policy with [[state intervention]].&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing ''laissez-faire'' camp of classical liberals, like [[Ludwig von Mises]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Guido Hülsmann]], [https://mises.org/daily/6022/ Against the Neoliberals], Ludwig von Mises Institute, May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Eucken, Röpke, Rüstow and Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |author=Taylor C. Boas, Jordan Gans-Morse |journal=Studies in Comparative International Development |date=June 2009 |volume=44 |issue=2 |page=147 |doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military rule under Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression to describe the [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973–1990)|economic reforms implemented there]] and its proponents (the "[[Chicago Boys]]").&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Once this new meaning was established among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to one study of 148 scholarly articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has largely become a term of condemnation employed by critics and suggests a [[market fundamentalism]] closer to the ''laissez-faire'' principles of the paleoliberals{{who|date=October 2016}} than to the ideas of those who originally attended the colloquium. This leaves some controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the [[social science]]s, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

Another center-left movement from [[modern American liberalism]] that used the term "neoliberalism" to describe its ideology formed in the United States in the 1970s. According to David Brooks, prominent neoliberal politicians included Al Gore and Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/opinion/11brooks.html?_r=0 The Vanishing Neoliberal], The New York Times, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and the ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/chait-neoliberal-new-inquiry-democrats-socialism/|title=The First Neoliberals|last= Robin|first=Corey|date= April 28, 2016|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|publisher= |access-date= April 23, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "godfather" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist [[Charles Peters]],&lt;ref&gt;Matt Welch, [http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/25/the-death-of-contrarianism The Death of Contrarianism.

===Current usage===
Elizabeth Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left-leaning academics in the 1970s "to describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, "Review," ''Journal of Modern History''  (Dec 2014) 86#4 pp. 884–90&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberal theory argues that a free market will allow efficiency, economic growth, income distribution, and technological progress to occur. Any state intervention to encourage these phenomena will worsen economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism|last=Kotz|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, neoliberalism is commonly used as a [[catchphrase]] and [[pejorative]] term, outpacing similar terms such as [[monetarism]], [[neoconservatism]], the [[Washington Consensus]] and "market reform" in much scholarly writing,&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; The term has been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/neoliberalism-making-a-boogeyman-out-of-a-buzzword/|title=Neoliberalism: Making a Boogeyman Out of a Buzzword {{!}} Max Borders|last=Borders|first=Max|date=2015-06-26|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/archives/2001/07/01/global-village-or-global-pilla|title=Global Village or Global Pillage?|date=2001-07-01|newspaper=Reason.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly by those who often advocate for policies characterized as neoliberal.&lt;ref name="kotz"/&gt;{{rp|74}} Historian Daniel Stedman Jones says the term "is too often used as a catch-all shorthand for the horrors associated with globalization and recurring financial crises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics |last=Stedman Jones |first=Daniel |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691151571 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} ''The Handbook of Neoliberalism'' posits that the term has "become a means of identifying a seemingly ubiquitous set of market-oriented policies as being largely responsible for a wide range of social, political, ecological and economic problems". Yet the handbook argues to view the term as merely a pejorative or "radical political slogan" is to "reduce its capacity as an analytic frame. If neoliberalism is to serve as a way of understanding the transformation of society over the last few decades then the concept is in need of unpacking".&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Currently, neoliberalism is most commonly used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating [[price control]]s, [[deregulation|deregulating]] capital markets, lowering trade barriers" and reducing state influence on the economy, especially through [[privatization]] and [[austerity]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Other scholars note that neoliberalism is associated with the economic policies introduced by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States.&lt;ref name = "For Business Ethics"/&gt;

There are several distinct usages of the term that can be identified:
* As a [[development model]], it refers to the rejection of [[structuralist economics]] in favor of the Washington Consensus.
* As an [[ideology]], it denotes a conception of freedom as an overarching [[Value (ethics)|social value]] associated with reducing state functions to those of a [[minimal state]].

Sociologists [[Fred L. Block]] and Margaret R. Somers claim there is a dispute over what to call the influence of free market ideas which have been used to justify the retrenchment of [[New Deal]] programs and policies over the last thirty years: neoliberalism, ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or "free market ideology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred L.

==Early history==

===Colloque Walter Lippmann===

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought about high unemployment and widespread poverty and was widely regarded as a failure of [[economic liberalism]]. To renew liberalism, a group of 25 intellectuals organised the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann Colloquium]] at Paris in August 1938. It brought together [[Louis Rougier]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]] and [[Alexander Rüstow]] among others. Most agreed that the liberalism of ''laissez-faire'' had failed and that a new liberalism needed to take its place with a major role for the state. Mises and Hayek refused to condemn ''laissez-faire'', but all participants were united in their call for a new project they dubbed "neoliberalism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} They agreed to develop the Colloquium into a permanent think tank called Centre International d’Études pour la Rénovation du Libéralisme based in Paris.

Deep disagreements in the group separated "true (third way) neoliberals" around Rüstow and Lippmann on the one hand and old school liberals around Mises and Hayek on the other. The first group wanted a strong state to supervise, while the second insisted that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Rüstow wrote that Hayek and Mises were relics of the liberalism that caused the Great Depression. Mises denounced the other faction, complaining that [[ordoliberalism]] really meant "ordo-interventionism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

===Mont Pelerin Society===
Neoliberalism began accelerating in importance with the establishment of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947, whose founding members included [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Karl Popper]], [[George Stigler]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The Colloque Walter Lippmann was largely forgotten.&lt;ref name="JACKSON p=129"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal | last=Jackson | first=Ben | title=At the Origins of Neo-Liberalism: The Free Economy and the Strong State, 1930–1947 | journal=The Historical Journal | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=53 | issue=1 | date=2010-01-29 | issn=0018-246X | doi=10.1017/s0018246x09990392 |subscription=yes | pages=129–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new society brought together the widely scattered free market thinkers and political figures.

{{quote|Hayek and others believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws and that the only way to diagnose and rectify them was to withdraw into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16}}}}

With [[central planning]] in the ascendancy worldwide and few avenues to influence policymakers, the society served to bring together isolated advocates of liberalism as a "rallying point" – as Milton Friedman phrased it. Meeting annually, it would soon be a "kind of international 'who's who' of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Nash]], ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1976, {{ISBN|978-1-882926-12-1}}, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the epicenter of the community with Europeans dominating the leadership.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

==Post-World War II neo-liberal currents==

===Argentina===
{{further|José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|Domingo Cavallo}}
In the 1960s, [[Latin America]]n intellectuals began to notice the ideas of [[ordoliberalism]]; these intellectuals often used the Spanish term "neoliberalismo" to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly impressed by the social market economy and the Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Neoliberalism in 1960s meant essentially a philosophy that was more moderate than classical liberalism and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency toward monopoly.&lt;ref name="Boas2009" /&gt;

In 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by Martínez de Hoz was the first attempt at a neoliberalist plan in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal austerity plan, whose goal was to reduce money printing and thus inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen, but they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. Aiming for a free market, they also decided to open the country's borders, so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for the last 20 years since Frondizi's economic plan, rapidly declined, because it wasn't able to compete with foreign goods. Finally, the deregulation of the financial sector, gave a short-term growth, but then rapidly fell apart when capital fled to the United States in the Reagan years.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1989 to 2001, another neoliberalist plan was attempted by Domingo Cavallo. This time, the privatization of public services was the main objective of the government; although financial deregulation and open borders to foreign goods were also re-implemented. While some privatizations were welcomed, the majority of them were criticized for not being in the people's best interests. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the final result of this plan was an unemployment rate of 25% and 60% of people living under the poverty line, alongside 33 people killed by the police in protests that ended up with the president, Fernando de la Rúa, resigning two years before his term as president was completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Australia===
In Australia, neoliberal economic policies (known at the time as "economic rationalism"&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, M., 2003. Economic rationalism in Canberra: A nation-building state changes its mind. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "economic fundamentalism") were embraced by governments of both the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] since the 1980s. The Labor governments of [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] from 1983-96 pursued economic liberalisation and a program of micro-economic reform. These governments privatised government corporations, deregulated factor markets, floated the [[Australian dollar]] and reduced trade protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803004406/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html |date=2012-08-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating, as federal treasurer, implemented a compulsory [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation guarantee]] system in 1992 to increase national savings and reduce future government liability for old age pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson L and Harris B ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/BN/2008-09/Chron_Superannuation.htm Chronology of superannuation and retirement income in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909175528/http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/BN/2008-09/Chron_Superannuation.htm |date=2011-09-09 }} Parliamentary Library, Canberra, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The financing of universities was deregulated, requiring students to contribute to [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|university fees]] through a repayable loan system known as the [[Higher Education Contribution Scheme]] (HECS) and encouraging universities to increase income by admitting full-fee-paying students, including foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Marginson S [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3310 Tertiary Education: A revolution to what end?]'' Online Opinion, 5 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of domestic fee-paying students to public universities was abolished in 2009 by the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Labor government]].&lt;ref name="Ministers Media Centre, Australian Government 2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Government Delivers on Promise to Phase Out Full Fee Degrees |website=Ministers' Media Centre, Australian Government |date=2008-10-29 |url=https://ministers.jobs.gov.au/gillard/government-delivers-promise-phase-out-full-fee-degrees |access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to the mainland capitals by refugees had seen capital flows follow soon after, such as from war-torn [[Lebanon]] and [[Vietnam]]. Latter economic-migrants from mainland [[China]] also, up to recent restrictions, had invested significantly in the property markets.

In 1955, a select group of Chilean students (later known as the [[Chicago Boys]]) were invited to the [[University of Chicago]] to pursue postgraduate studies in economics. They worked directly under Friedman and his disciple, [[Arnold Harberger]], while also being exposed to Hayek. When they returned to Chile in the 1960s, they began a concerted effort to spread the philosophy and policy recommendations of the Chicago and Austrian schools, setting up think tanks and publishing in ideologically sympathetic media. Under the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship headed by Pinochet]] and severe social repression, the Chicago boys implemented [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973-1990)|radical economic reform]]. The latter half of the 1970s witnessed rapid and extensive privatization, deregulation and reductions in trade barriers. In 1978, policies that would reduce the role of the state and infuse competition and individualism into areas such as labor relations, pensions, health and education were introduced.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; These policies resulted in widening inequality as they negatively impacted the wages, benefits and working conditions of Chile's working class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Peter Winn]] (ed), ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/Victims-of-the-Chilean-Miracle/ Victims of the Chilean Miracle: Workers and Neoliberalism in the Pinochet Era, 1973–2002]'', ([[Duke University Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|082233321X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Constable and Arturo Valenzuela, ''A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet,'' ([[W.

Retrieved December 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Naomi Klein|Klien]], by the late 1980s the economy had stabilized and was growing, but around 45% of the population had fallen into poverty while the wealthiest 10% saw their incomes rise by 83%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2008).

In 1990, the military dictatorship ended. Hayek argued that increased economic freedom had put pressure on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. Years earlier, he argued that "economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean scholars Martínez and Díaz rejected this argument, pointing to the long tradition of democracy in Chile. The return of democracy required the defeat of the Pinochet regime, though it had been fundamental in saving capitalism. The essential contribution came from profound mass rebellions and finally, old party elites using old institutional mechanisms to bring back democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Martínez, Alvaro Díaz, The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8157-5478-7}}, pp. 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union (EU) is sometimes considered as a neoliberal organization as it facilitates free trade and freedom of movement.

===Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F015320-0010, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludwig Erhard]]]]
Neoliberal ideas were first implemented in [[West Germany]]. The economists around [[Ludwig Erhard]] drew on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contributed to West Germany's reconstruction after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepted this classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Erhard, [http://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/le64a.htm Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund], In: Ludwig Erhard, Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, hrsg. v. Karl Hohmann, Düsseldorf u. a. 1988, S. 861, Rede zu Oppenheimers 100. Geburtstag, gehalten in der Freien Universität Berlin (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] was more pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] coined the phrase "social market economy" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that "social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time".&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]
Erhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt; He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a "reluctant expansion of the welfare state". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Abelshauser, Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945, C.H.Beck, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-406-510946}}, Seite 192&lt;/ref&gt; Rüstow, who had coined the label "neoliberalism", criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare program.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;

Hayek did not like the expression "social market economy", but stated in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using that phrase. However, in Hayek's view the social market economy's aiming for both a market economy and [[social justice]] was a muddle of inconsistent aims.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Drexl, ''Die wirtschaftliche Selbstbestimmung des Verbrauchers'', J.C.B. Mohr, 1998, {{ISBN|3-16-146938-0}}, Abschnitt: Freiheitssicherung auch gegen den Sozialstaat, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his controversies with the German neoliberals at the Mont Pelerin Society, [[Ludwig von Mises]] stated that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this "a lesson for the US".&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Ptak, Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland, 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to different research Mises believed that the ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwig's complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the ordoliberals, Mises wrote: "I have no illusions about the true character of the politics and politicians of the social market economy". According to Mises, Erhard's teacher [[Franz Oppenheimer]] "taught more or less the [[New Frontier]] line of" [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy's]] "Harvard consultants ([[Arthur M. Schlesinger|Schlesinger]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Guido Jorg Hulsmann, Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, {{ISBN|978-1933550183}}, pp. 1007–08&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, neoliberalism at first was synonymous with both ordoliberalism and social market economy. But over time the original term neoliberalism gradually disappeared since social market economy was a much more positive term and fit better into the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) mentality of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hartwich" /&gt;

During the 1990s, the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] also embraced neoliberalism&lt;ref name="Handbook144"/&gt; by supporting the passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), continuing the deregulation of the financial sector through passage of the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000|Commodity Futures Modernization Act]] and the repeal of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] and implementing cuts to the [[Welfare state#United States|welfare state]] through passage of the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]].&lt;ref name="Karagiannis"&gt;Nikolaos Karagiannis, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, Swapan Sen (eds).

=== New Zealand ===
{{See also|Rogernomics}}
In New Zealand, neoliberal economic policies were implemented under the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] led by Prime Minister [[David Lange]]. These neoliberal policies are commonly referred to as [[Rogernomics]], a portmanteau of “Roger” and “economics”,  after Lange appointed Roger Douglas minister of finance in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Life|last=Lange|first=David|publisher=Viking|year=2005|isbn=0-670-04556-X|location=|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange's government had inherited a severe balance of payments crisis as a result of the deficits from the previously implemented two-year freeze on wages and prices by preceding Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] who had also stubbornly maintained an unsustainable exchange rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Schools Compete: A Cautionary Tale|last=Fiske|first=Edward B.|last2=Ladd|first2=Helen F.|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8157-2835-2|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherited economic conditions lead Lange to remark “We ended up being run very similarly to a Polish shipyard.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=David Lange, in his own words|last=|first=|date=15 August 2005|work=The New Zealand Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September 1984 Lange's government held an Economic Summit to discuss the underlying problems in the New Zealand economy, which lead to advocacy of radical economic reform previously proposed by the Treasury Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution: New Zealand from Fortress to Free Market|last=Russell|first=Marcia|publisher=Hodder Moa Beckett|year=1996|isbn=1869584287|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reform program consisting of deregulation and the removal of tariffs and subsidies was put in place which consequently affected [[New Zealand's agricultural community|New Zealand's agricultural community]], who were hit hard by the loss of subsidies to farmers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution: New Zealand from Fortress to Free Market|last=Russell|first=Marcia|publisher=Hodder Moa Becket|year=1996|isbn=1869584287|location=|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A superannuation surcharge was introduced, despite having promised not to reduce [[superannuation]], resulting in [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] losing support from the elderly. The finance markets were also deregulated, removing restrictions on interests rates, lending and foreign exchange and in March 1985, the New Zealand dollar was floated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/cartoon/33456/floating-the-new-zealand-dollar|title=Reserve Bank - Reverse Bank, 1936 to 1984|last=Singleton|first=John|date=20 June 2012|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of government departments were converted into state-owned enterprises which lead to great job loss: Electricity Corporation 3,000; Coal Corporation 4,000; Forestry Corporation 5,000; New Zealand Post 8,000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

New Zealand became a part of a global economy. The focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance as a result of zero restrictions on overseas money coming into the country. Finance capital outstripped industrial capital and subsequently, the manufacturing industry suffered approximately 76,000 job losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I See Red|last=Bell|first=Judith|publisher=Awa Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives its name from its origin in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of economic analysis, Oxford University Press 1996, {{ISBN|978-0195105599}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st century usage by such economists as [[Mark Skousen]], reference to the Austrian school often denotes a reference to the free-market economics of [[Friedrich Hayek]] who began his teaching in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skouzen. ''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the contributions of the Austrian School to economic theory are the [[subjective theory of value]], [[marginalism]] in price theory and the formulation of the [[economic calculation problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Birner | first1 = Jack| first2 = Rudy | last2 = van Zijp| title = Hayek, Co-ordination and Evolution: His Legacy in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and the History of Ideas| location = London, New York| publisher = [[Routledge]]|date=1994| page = 94| isbn = 978-0-415-09397-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theories developed by "first wave" Austrian economists have been absorbed into most [[Mainstream economics|mainstream]] schools of economics. These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on [[opportunity cost]] and Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's theories on time preference as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of [[Marxian economics]]. The Austrian School follows an approach, termed [[methodological individualism]], a version of which was codified by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and termed "[[praxeology]]" in his book published in English as ''[[Human Action]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Ludwigvon"&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1949] 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000 that "the Austrian School have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan.

===Chicago School===
{{Chicago school sidebar|expanded=movements}}
The [[Chicago school of economics]] describes a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of [[University of Chicago]]. Chicago [[macroeconomic]] theory rejected [[Keynesianism]] in favor of [[monetarism]] until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations.&lt;ref name=ElgarComp&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmet|first=Ross|title=The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics|date=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-1840648744|page=133|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is strongly associated with economists such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref name=Mirowski&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirowski|first=Philip|title=The Road from Mont Pelerin: The Making of the Neoliberal Thought Collective|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674033183|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21 century, economists such as [[Mark Skousen]] refer to [[Friedrich Hayek]] as a key economist who influenced this school in the 20th century having started his career in Vienna and the Austrian school of economics.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skousen. ''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). Although the school's association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents,&lt;ref name="ElgarComp" /&gt; its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.&lt;ref name="FPIF-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biglaiser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biglaiser|first=Glen|title=The Internationalization of Chicago's Economics in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=January 2002|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1086/322875|pages=269–86|jstor=322875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political policy aspects==

===Political freedom===
In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek has argued: "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"/&gt;

[[File:Milton friedman y richard nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Richard Nixon]]]]
Later in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman developed the argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression.

In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Milton Friedman.

Amplifying Friedman's argument, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tend to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy. Other scholars see the existence of non-democratic yet market-liberal regimes and the undermining of democratic control by market processes as strong evidence that such a general, ahistorical nexus cannot be upheld.&lt;ref name="WBrown"/&gt; Contemporary discussion on the relationship between neoliberalism and democracy shifted to a more historical perspective, studying extent and circumstances of how much the two are mutually dependent, contradictory or incompatible.

[[Stanley Fish]] argues that neoliberalization of academic life may promote a narrower and in his opinion more accurate definition of [[academic freedom]] "as the freedom to do the academic job, not the freedom to expand it to the point where its goals are infinite". What Fish urges is "not an inability to take political stands, but a refraining from doing so in the name of academic responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/ Academic Freedom Against Itself] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228071627/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/# |date=2018-02-28 }}, New York Times Opionator, 28 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on economic efficiency===
Much of the literature in support of neoliberalism relies on the idea that neoliberal market logic improves a very narrow monetized conception of performance, which is not necessarily the best approach. This focus on economic efficiency can compromise other, perhaps more important factors. Anthropologist Mark Fleming argues that when the performance of a transit system is assessed purely in terms of economic efficiency, social goods such as strong workers' rights are considered impediments to maximum performance, which given the monetization of time means timely premium rapid networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=Mark|title=Mass Transit Workers and Neoliberal Time Discipline in San Francisco|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2016|volume=118|issue=4|pages=784–95|accessdate=|doi=10.1111/aman.12683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the case study of the San Francisco Muni, Fleming shows that neoliberal worldview has resulted in vicious attacks on the drivers' union, for example through the setting of impossible schedules so that drivers are necessarily late and through brutal public smear campaigns. This ultimately resulted in the passing of Proposition G, which severely undermined the powers of the Muni drivers' union. Workers' rights are by no means the only victims of the neoliberal focus on economic efficiency as it is important to recognize that this vision and metric of performance judgment de-emphasizes literally every public good that is not conventionally monetized. For example, the geographers Birch and Siemiatycki contend that the growth of marketization ideology has shifted discourse such that it focuses on monetary rather than social objectives, making it harder to justify public goods driven by equity, environmental concerns and social justice.&lt;ref name="Birch Siemiatycki pp. 177–198"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Birch |first=Kean |last2=Siemiatycki |first2=Matti |title=Neoliberalism and the geographies of marketization |journal=Progress in Human Geography |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=40 |issue=2 |date=2015-03-05 |issn=0309-1325 |doi=10.1177/0309132515570512 |pages=177–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Thomas Volscho argues that the imposition of neoliberalism in the United States arose from a conscious political mobilization by capitalist elites in the 1970s who faced two crises: the legitimacy of capitalism and a falling rate of profitability in industry. Various neoliberal ideologies (such as [[monetarism]] and [[supply-side economics]]) had been long advanced by elites, translated into policies by the Reagan administration and ultimately resulted in less governmental regulation and a shift from a tax-financed state to a debt-financed one. While the profitability of industry and the rate of economic growth never recovered to the heyday of the 1960s, the political and economic power of Wall Street and finance capital vastly increased due to the debt-financing of the state.&lt;ref name="Volscho pp. 249–266"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volscho |first=Thomas |title=The Revenge of the Capitalist Class: Crisis, the Legitimacy of Capitalism and the Restoration of Finance from the 1970s to Present |journal=Critical Sociology |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=43 |issue=2 |date=2016-07-28 |issn=0896-9205 |ssrn=2602893 |id={{OCLC|7374542920|6962223812}} |doi=10.1177/0896920515589003 |pages=249–266}} SSRN Pre-publication is free access {{free access}}; SAGE Journals doi publication is closed access {{closed access}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In expanding upon Wacquant's thesis, sociologist and political economist John L. Campbell of [[Dartmouth College]] suggests that through [[Private prison|privatization]], the prison system exemplifies the centaur state: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand, it punishes the lower class, which populates the prisons; on the other hand, it profits the upper class, which owns the prisons, and it employs the middle class, which runs them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, he says the prison system benefits corporations through outsourcing as the inmates are "slowly becoming a source of low-wage labor for some US corporations". Both through privatization and outsourcing, Campbell argues, the penal state reflects neoliberalism.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Neoliberalism's penal and debtor states |author=[http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/john-l-campbell John L.

===Global health===
The effect of neoliberalism on global health, particularly the aspect of international aid, involves key players such as [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. According to James Pfeiffer,&lt;ref name="Pfieffer UW faculty page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/james-pfeiffer|title=James Pfeiffer |publisher=University of Washington - Department of Global Health|website=globalhealth.washington.edu|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; neoliberal emphasis has been placed on free markets and privatization which has been tied to the "new policy agenda" in which NGOs are seen as being able to provide better social welfare than governments. International NGOs have been promoted to fill holes in public services created by the World Bank and IMF through their promotion of [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) which reduce government health spending and which Pfeiffer criticized as unsustainable. The reduced health spending and the gain of the public health sector by NGOs causes the local health system to become fragmented, undermines local control of health programs and contributes to local social inequality between NGO workers and local individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Pfeiffer |first1 = J |year = 2003 |title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration |doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0 |journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume = 56 |issue = 4 |pages =  725–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers for the IMF released a paper entitled "Neoliberalism: Oversold?", which stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is much to cheer in the neoliberal agenda. The expansion of global trade has rescued millions from abject poverty. Foreign direct investment has often been a way to transfer technology and know-how to developing economies. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has in many instances led to more efficient provision of services and lowered the fiscal burden on governments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.
* The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.
* Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-neoliberalism-warnings-2016-5 IMF: The last generation of economic policies may have been a complete failure].

Rowden wrote that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritising price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure, resulting in chronically underfunded public health systems, demoralising working conditions that have fueled a "[[brain drain]]" of medical personnel and the undermining of public health and the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]] in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS|last=Rowden|first=Rick|publisher=Zed Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1848132856|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the rise of neoliberalism eroded the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower-era Republican centrism]] that had resulted in the massive allocation of public capital to large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in both [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]: "In the pre-Reagan era, infrastructure was an apolitical, positively connoted, technocratic term shared by mainstream economists and policy makers […] including President Eisenhower, a praetorian Republican leader who had championed investment in the Interstate Highway System, America’s national road grid […] But Reagan, Thatcher, Delors and their many admirers amongst Clintonian, ‘[[New Labour]]’ and EU Social-Democrat decision makers in Brussels sought to dismantle the generous state subsidies for social infrastructure and public transportation across the United States, Britain and the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas J. Firzli, [https://www.academia.edu/26978017/After_The_Neoliberals_A_New_Middle_Way_for_Britain_and_America_Rescuing_Native_Workers_and_Jumpstarting_the_Economy/ The End of 'Globalization’? Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age], ''Revue Analyse Financière'' (July 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Brexit]], the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] and the progressive emergence of a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" ("[[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]]") moving away to some extent from the neoliberal orthodoxies of the past, we may witness a "massive increase in infrastructure investment" in the United States, Britain and other advanced economies:&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman : [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age', Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2016 – Issue N°60]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;With the victory of [[Donald J. Trump]] on November 8, 2016, the 'neoliberal-neoconservative' policy consensus that had crystalized in 1979–1980 (Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States, election of Reagan and Thatcher) finally came to an end [...] The deliberate neglect of America's creaking infrastructure assets (notably public transportation and water sanitation) from the early 1980s on eventually fueled a widespread popular discontent that came back to haunt both [[Hillary Clinton]] and the Republican establishment. Donald Trump was quick to seize on the issue to make a broader slap against the ''laissez-faire'' complacency of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [http://www.analysefinanciere.org/2017/01/26/understanding-trumponomics 'Understanding Trumponomics', Revue Analyse Financière, 26 January 2017 – Supplement to Issue N°62]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others such as Catherine Rottenberg do not see Trump's victory as an end to neoliberalism, but rather a new phase of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/trumping-neoliberalism-steroids-161215144834626.html|title=Trumping it up: Neoliberalism on steroids|last= Rottenberg|first=Catherine|date=December 18, 2016 |website=Al Jazeera|publisher= |access-date= April 20, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporatocracy===
{{main|Corporatocracy}}
Mark Arthur has written that the influence of neoliberalism has given rise to an "[[anti-corporatists|anti-corporatist]]" movement in opposition to it. This "anti-corporatist" movement is articulated around the need to re-claim the power that corporations and global institutions have stripped governments of. He says that [[Adam Smith]]'s "rules for mindful markets" served as a basis for the anti-corporate movement, "following government's failure to restrain corporations from hurting or disturbing the happiness of the neighbor [Smith]".&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and the Prospects for World Government. Mark Arthur, Trafford Publishing, 2003, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the neoliberal era was essentially defined by "the economic ideas of Milton Friedman, who wrote that 'if anything is certain to destroy our free society, to undermine its very foundation, it would be a widespread acceptance by management of social responsibilities in some sense other than to make as much money as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine'".&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

===Political opposition===

Counterpoints to neoliberalism:
* Globalization can subvert nations' ability for [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Terrence McDonough, "The Irish Crash in Global Context", Department of Economics, National University of Ireland, Galway, and ''World Review of Political Economy 1.3'' (Fall 2010): 442–62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The replacement of a government-owned monopoly with private companies, each supposedly trying to provide the consumer with better value service than all of its private competitors, removes the efficiency that can be gained from the economy of scale.&lt;ref&gt;Katter, Bob (2012) 'An incredible race of people: a passionate history of Australia', (page numbers to be provided)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even if it could be shown that neoliberal capitalism increases productivity, it erodes the conditions in which production occurs long term, i.e. resources/nature, requiring expansion into new areas. It is therefore not sustainable within the world's limited geographical space.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. (2011) 'Transcending the metabolic rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist worldecology', Journal of Peasant Studies, 38: 1, 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social and ecological damages: heterodox economists argue that neoliberalism is a system that socializes costs and privatizes profits. It is thus a system of unpaid costs and avoidance of responsibility. The main solution are seen in social controls of the economy to prevent damages, namely the precautionary principle and the reversal of the burden of proof. This markedly differs from neoclassical and neoliberal solutions that propose taxes, bargaining, or judicial process.&lt;ref name="Berger 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Sebastian |title=The social costs of neoliberalism : essays on the economics of K.

According to the economists Howell and Diallo, neoliberal policies have contributed to a United States economy in which 30% of workers earn low wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers) and 35% of the labor force is underemployed as only 40% of the working-age population in the country is adequately employed.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, David R. and Mamadou Diallo. 2007.

The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR) Dean Baker (2006) argued that the driving force behind rising inequality in the United States has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including anti-inflationary bias, anti-[[Trade union|unionism]] and profiteering in the health industry.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. 2006. "Increasing Inequality in the United States.[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue40/Baker40.pdf]" Post-autistic Economics Review 40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, countries have applied neoliberal policies at varying levels of intensity—for example, the [[OECD]] has calculated that only 6% of Swedish workers are beset with wages it considers low and that Swedish wages are overall lower.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2007. "[http://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/38749309.pdf OECD Employment Outlook.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], asserts that the [[Triumphalism|triumphalist]] attitudes of Western powers at the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fixation with linking all leftist political ideals with the excesses of [[Stalinism]], permitted neoliberal, free market capitalism to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment and rising inequality throughout the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and much of the West in the following decades that has fueled the resurgence of extremist [[nationalism]]s in both the former and the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=xix–xx, 134, 197–99 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

Ruth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the [[University of Sheffield]], accuses the United States and its allies of fomenting [[state terrorism]] and mass killings during the Cold War as a means to buttress and promote the expansion of capitalism and neoliberalism in the developing world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">The ''' New Man ''' is a [[utopia]]n concept that involves the creation of a new ideal human being or [[citizen]] replacing un-ideal human beings or citizens. The meaning of a New Man has widely varied and various alternatives have been suggested by a variety of religions and political ideologies, including [[Christianity]], [[communism]], [[classical liberalism]], [[fascism]], and [[utopian socialism]].

==Philosophical and religious versions==

===Christian New Man===
The doctrines of [[Paul the Apostle]] speak of [[Adam]] both as the fallen "Old Adam" and a "New Adam" as referring collectively to the fallen Old Man of humanity and a resurrected "New Man" (Ephesians 2:15, The Holy Bible) following [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung Hoon Kim, Chŏng-hun Kim. ''The significance of clothing imagery in the Pauline Corpus''. New York, New York, USA: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004. Pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzschean ''Übermensch''===
Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of an ''[[Übermensch]]'' ("Overman") was that of a New Man who would be a leader by example to humanity through an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[will to power]] that was [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and [[Irrationalism|irrationalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Stralen. ''Choices and conflict: essays on literature and existentialism''. Pp. Brussels, Belgium: Peter Lang, 2005. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche developed the concept in response to his view of the [[herd mentality]] of and inherent [[nihilism]] of Christianity, and the void in existential meaning that is realized with the [[death of God]]. The Übermensch emerges as the new meaning of the Earth, a norm-repudiating individual who overcomes himself and is the master in control of his impulses and passions.

==Political versions==

===Liberal New Man===
[[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Godwin]] believed that the spread of liberalism in [[France]] and the [[United States]] constituted the birth of a New Man and a new era.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopian Socialist New Man===
[[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]] such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] saw a future [[Golden Age]] led by a New Man who would reconstruct society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist New Man===
{{see also|New Soviet man}}
[[Marxism]], though heavily critical of [[utopianism]], postulates the development of a New Man and New Woman in a [[communist society]] following the values of a non-essential nature of the state and the importance of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated]] work for the affirmation of a person's humanity. Marxism does not see the New Man/Woman as a goal or prerequisite for achieving full communism, but rather as a product of the social conditions of pure communism. [[Che Guevara]]'s essay "Socialism and man in [[Cuba]]" and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' are two examples of the 'new man' archetype in socialist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm|title=Socialism and man in Cuba|first=Che|last=Guevara|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist New Man===
[[Fascism]] supports the creation of a New Man who is a figure of action, violence, and [[masculinity]], committed as a component of a disciplined mass that has shorn itself of [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. Pp. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this was the idea of the [[Political Soldier]], which was developed by the leaders of the [[Official National Front]] in the UK in the 1980s and became part of the ideology of the [[Third Position]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2010/04/26/political-soldiers-and-the-new-man-part-one |title=Political Soldiers and the New Man - part one |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 April 2010 |website=[[Community Security Trust]] |access-date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2010/04/27/political-soldiers-and-the-new-man-part-two |title=Political Soldiers and the New Man - part two |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 April 2010 |website=[[Community Security Trust]] |access-date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhumanist New Man===
[[Transhumanism]] welcomes the creation of a literal ''new man'' by enhancements through cybernetics and other "human enhancements", and look to the [[Transhumanism#Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity|singularity]] as that point in time when the new man arrives, his birthday if you will.  Scholar [[Klaus Vondung]] argues that Transhumanism represents the final revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364|title=Revolutions: Finished and Unfinished, From Primal to Final|first1=Paul|last1=Caringella|first2=Wayne|last2=Cristaudo|first3=Glenn|last3=Hughes|date=21 February 2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have made similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5|title=New man in utopian and transhumanist perspective|first=Richard|last=Saage|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Futures Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3rABgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 Knowing New Biotechnologies: Social Aspects of Technological Convergence], p. 77-91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the "New Man" ==

===Poetic parody===

The poem "[[The Unknown Citizen]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15549
 |title       = The Unknown Citizen
 |accessdate  = January 28, 2013
 |authorlink  = W. H. Auden
 |work        = Another Time
 |publisher   = Random House
 |year        = 1940
 |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/6E0z51d11?url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15549
 |archivedate = January 28, 2013
 |deadurl     = yes
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[W. H. Auden]] is considered&lt;ref&gt;(see the [[The Unknown Citizen#Interpretation|Interpretation]] section of the [[Wikipedia]] article about that poem)&lt;/ref&gt; a parody of attempts to honor (and hence, to encourage) a certain kind of behavior in modern society.  It challenges the "New Man" ideologies listed here and deprecates the [[Viral phenomenon|meme]] of encouraging [[conformity]] via [[Normative social influence|societal pressure]].

A '''political gaffe''' is an error made by a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gaffe?q=gaffe |title=Definition for gaffe – Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaffe'' is of French origin, originally a 'boat hook' as in '[[gaff rig]]' where the relation is apparent, but the sense association to a blundering remark is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gaffe|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinsley gaffe==
A Kinsley gaffe occurs when a political gaffe reveals some truth that a politician did not intend to admit.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gaffe  | first=Merriam | last=Webster  |authorlink=Merriam Webster| date= June 3, 1972  | title=Merriam Webster definition of Gaffe |publisher=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politicaldictionary.com/index/g/ |first1=Taegan |last1=Goddard |work=Taegan Goddard's Political Dictionary |publisher=[[Political Wire]] |title=Kinsley Gaffe |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from journalist [[Michael Kinsley]], who said, "A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say."&lt;ref name="Kinsley"&gt;{{citation |first=Michael |last=Kinsley|date=April 23, 1988 |title= Commentary: The gaffer speaks |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |title=Word of the Week: Kinsley Gaffe |first1=Nancy |last1=Friedman |date=August 22, 2011 |work=Fritinancy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ouyRf44?url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |archivedate=April 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gaffe may be used to describe an inadvertent statement by a politician that the politician believes is true while the politician has not fully analyzed the consequences of publicly stating it. Another definition is a statement made when the politician privately believes it to be true, realizes the dire consequences of saying it, and yet inadvertently utters, in public, the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brill makes a "Kinsley gaffe" |url=http://sheckymagazine.com/2012/01/brill-makes-a-kinsley-gaffe/ |first1=Brian |last1=McKim |first2=Tracy |last2=Skene |publisher=Shecky Magazine.com|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is a politician's statement of what is on his or her mind{{mdash}}this may or may not be inadvertent{{mdash}}thereby leading to a ritualized 'gaffe dance' between candidates. While exhibiting umbrage or shock, and playing on the mistake, the 'offended candidate' must not exhibit anything resembling glee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jon.smajda.com/2008/10/23/michael-kinsey-on-the-ritual-of-the-gaffe/ |first1=Jon |last1=Smajda |title=Michael Kinsley on the ritual of the gaffe |date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kinsley2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/06/opinion/la-oe-kinsley-limbaugh-20120306 |date=March 6, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Kinsley: Limbaugh and the hypocrisy of the gaffe |first1=Michael |last1=Kinsley |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A propensity to concentrate on so-called 'gaffes' in campaigns has been criticized as a journalistic device that can lead to distraction from real issues.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;". . . the episode is a perfect gaffe precisely because its content was so meaningless. . ." {{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/origins-of-the-gaffe-politics-idiot-maker.html  |title=The Origins of the Gaffe, Politics’ Idiot-Maker |first1=Jonathan |last1=Chait |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=June 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsley gaffe is said to be a species of the general 'political gaffe.'&lt;ref name="Amira"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/taxonomy-of-gaffes.html |date=June 14, 2012 |title=A Taxonomy of Gaffes |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |first1=Dan |last1=Amira |location=New York, NY USA|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsley himself posed the question: "Why should something a politician says by accident automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?"&lt;ref name="kinsley2"/&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] says that politicians use vague and indirect language to avoid making concrete statements, and that lazy journalists base political coverage around "gaffe spotting" rather than analysis of political platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS4xVcko9qw|title=Political Rhetoric, Explained - Steven Pinker|date=14 October 2008|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Internet activism]] has created a new generation of [[negative campaigning]] where a political campaign can create [[attack ad]]s within an hour of a politician making a gaffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/the-man-who-will-watch-every-word-tony-abbott-says-20130731-2qysi.html|title=Matthew McGregor Kevin Rudd Attack Dog, Mitt Romney Gaffe Video|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/rudd-flies-in-team-obama-20130730-2qxet.html|title=Rudd flies in Team Obama|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18043">The exploration of [[politics]] in [[science fiction]] is arguably older than the identification of the [[genre]].  One of the earliest works of modern science fiction, [[H. G. Wells]]’ ''[[The Time Machine]]'', is an extrapolation of the class structure of the [[United Kingdom]] of his time, an extreme form of [[Social Darwinism]]; during tens of thousands of years, human beings have [[evolution|evolved]] into two different species based on their social class.

==Speculative societies==
Most story and novel-length works of science fiction include speculation (directly or indirectly) on modes of life and [[behaviour]]. They are sometimes [[Allegory|allegorical]] and often serious attempts to model possible future societies, political institutions and systems. Examples include [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's]] novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]; and the [[Hostile Takeover Trilogy|''Hostile Takeover'' Trilogy]] by [[S. Andrew Swann]]. 
Imagined societies may be based on very different assumptions. Often the future is modeled on historic forms - feudalism,  or in the case of The Foundation series, the Roman Empire.  A common theme is the integration of humanity into some greater interstellar society. A popular modern example is the [[Uplift series|''Uplift'' series]] by David Brin where a species' status is defined based on the concept of [[biological uplift|biologically uplifting]] other species.

==Utopian societies==
{{main|Utopia}}
The term Utopia was invented by [[Thomas More]] as the title of his Latin book ''[[De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia]]'' (circa 1516), known more commonly as Utopia. He created the word "utopia" to suggest two Greek neologisms simultaneously: outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). More depicts a rationally organised society, through the narration of an explorer who discovers it—Raphael Hythlodaeus. Utopia is a republic where all property is held in common. In addition, it has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbours.

Generally speaking, utopias are generally societies whose author believes either perfect, or as perfect as can be attainable.  [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s ''[[Ecotopia]]'' is a contemporary example.  This can cause some confusion, in that some works generally recognized as “utopian”, such as [[Republic (Plato)|Plato’s ''Republic'']], can come across as much less than ideal to a modern reader.  They are one of the smaller subsets of political science fiction, possibly because it is difficult to create dramatic tension in a world the author believes is perfect.  Various authors get around this problem by postulating problems in the utopian society, such [[L. Neil Smith]] does.  Other ways of presenting a utopian society in science fiction, is to send characters outside it to explore beyond its confines (ala ''[[Star Trek]]''), or focus on an outsider character entering the society, as in [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]''.  This last method is often used to show that the utopian society shown is actually a [[dystopia]].  [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s approach in ''The [[Mars Trilogy]]'' involved exploring the creation of utopian and [[ecotopia]]n societies on Mars.

Another option for a Utopian society can be found in [[robotocracy]], or the rule of Robots or Computers, with the theory that a programmed machine can dispassionately provide for the welfare of all.  Examples of this include various works of [[Isaac Asimov]] and the planet of Sigma Draconis VI in the Star Trek episode "[[Spock's Brain (TOS episode)|Spock's Brain]]".  If the machine rule becomes harsh or oppressive, it may become a dystopia instead.

==Dystopian societies==
{{main|Dystopia}}
Dystopias are societies where the author illustrates the worst that can happen.  Usually this encompasses extrapolating trends the author sees as dangerous. During the 20th century many examples were written in reaction to the rise of [[Nazism]], [[Communism]] and [[Religious Fundamentalism]]:

*''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] which illustrates the ultimate [[totalitarian]] state in which the government is in control of every aspect of human existence, using [[propaganda]], universal [[surveillance]], and [[torture]].
*''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] was written after the war in response to [[Fascism]]. It is set in a world where the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces have won [[World War II]] and are rival [[superpower]]s. In it the main characters argue and are involved in politics and power.
*''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] tells the tale of a woman caught up in a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] [[dictatorship]] where women are forced into a system of sexual [[slavery]] for the ruling [[patriarchy]].

It is important to keep in mind that scenarios which some would describe as dystopic, others would describe as utopian. [[Norman Spinrad|Norman Spinrad's]] novel'' [[The Iron Dream]]'' was generally recognised to be a dystopic novel, but lauded by neo-Nazis as a utopia.

==Politics==
Often the political focus of a science fiction novel is less on the social order, but how people maneuver and achieve their agendas within a given system. Many [[space opera]]s rely on vast interstellar bureaucracies to drive their plots ''(see: [[Galactic empire]])''. [[George Lucas]]'s famous ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga [[Star Wars#Themes|features political science]] modeled after historic events. The Retief stories by [[Keith Laumer]] and the [[The Chanur Novels|Chanur books]] by [[C. J. Cherryh]] have politics and political maneuverings as some of the main themes, and [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' books offer advanced explorations of human politics, including the dovetailing economics. Often this focus can descend into [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] and [[paranoia]] where the premise is that there are secret forces out to get the protagonists, the seminal example of which is the ''[[Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''. Most commonly, science fiction deals with the political fallout of its own premises.  A story will posit some new event or technology and explore its political dimensions; this includes most [[techno-thriller]]s but also encompasses a large body of traditional science fiction. An example is the [[Philip K. Dick]] story ''[[The Minority Report]]'' (upon which the [[Minority Report (film)|film]] starring [[Tom Cruise]] is based), which introduces the idea of perfectly predicting a crime of violence so the perpetrator can be arrested before the crime is committed, and the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7701">{{Immanuel Kant}}

The '''[[political philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]]''' (1724–1804) favoured a [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=358 Kant’s Principles of Politics, including his essay on Perpetual Peace. A Contribution to Political Science]'', translation by W. Hastie, Edinburgh: Clark, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' (1795), Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics  by establishment of political [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (377). For a summary and&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in ''Doctrine of Right'' (1797), the first part of ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Riedel]] ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century Kant's political philosophy had been enjoying a remarkable renaissance in English-speaking countries with more major studies in a few years than had appeared in the preceding many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kant's Political Philosophy: Rechtsstaat or Council Democracy?|jstor = 1406673|journal = The Review of Politics|date = 1985-04-01|pages = 253–280|volume = 47|issue = 2|first = A. Anthony|last = Smith|doi=10.1017/s003467050003672x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kant's most significant contribution to political philosophy and the [[philosophy of law]] is the doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]''. According to this doctrine, the power of the state is limited in order to protect [[citizen]]s from the arbitrary exercise of [[authority]]. The ''Rechtsstaat'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Rechtsstaat|Rechtsstaat]]}}) is a concept in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking, originally borrowed from [[Germany|German]] [[jurisprudence]], which can be translated as "the legal state" or "state of rights". It is a  "constitutional [[State (polity)|state]]" in which the exercise of [[government]]al power is constrained by the [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], ''The Concept of the Political'', ch. 7; ''Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt; and is often tied to the [[Anglo-America]]n concept of the [[rule of law]]. Kant's political philosophy has been described as [[liberalism|liberal]] for its presumption of limits on the state based on the [[social contract]] as a regulative matter.&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland,  2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part 1), Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Rechtsstaat'', the citizens share legally based [[civil liberties]] and they can use the [[court]]s. A country cannot be a [[liberal democracy]] without first being a ''Rechtsstaat''. German writers usually place [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the ''Rechtsstaat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rechtsstaat'' in the meaning of "constitutional state" was introduced in the latest works of Immanuel Kant after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and constitutional government. Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a state is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty century.

The ''Rechtsstaat'' concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'': "The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of the theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, in ''History of Political Philosophy'', edited by [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''Rechtsstaat'' appeared in the German context in [[Robert von Mohl]]'s book ''Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates'' ("German police science according to the principles of the constitutional state", 1832–1834), and was contrasted with the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[police state]].

Kant opposed "democracy"{{spaced ndash}}which, in that era, meant [[direct democracy]]{{spaced ndash}}believing that [[majority rule]] posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "…democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which "all" decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, "all", who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As most writers at the time he distinguished three forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of government.

A distinctive feature of Kant's political philosophy is his conviction that the university should be a model of creative conflict: the philosopher's role within the university should be to "police" the higher faculties (which in his day were theology, law and medicine), making sure their teaching conforms to the principles of reason; likewise, the goal of perpetual peace in society can be achieved only when the rulers consult with philosophers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation and defense of these two aspects of Kant's political theory, see Stephen Palmquist's essays: [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KIUMWP.htm "Kant's Ideal of the University as a Model for World Peace"], in ''Papers of International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant'' (Tehran, Iran: Allame Tabataba'i University Press, 2005), pp.207-222; and [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/PSAP.htm "The Philosopher as a 'Secret Agent' for Peace: Taking Seriously Kant's Revival of the 'Old Question'"], in Valerio Rohden, Ricardo R. Terra and Guido A. de Almeida (eds.), ''Recht und Frieden in der Philosophie Kants'', vol. 4 of ''Akten des X. Internationalen Kant-Kongresses'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp.601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''political statement''' is used to refer to any act or non-verbal form of communication that is intended to influence a decision to be made for or by a political party.

A political statement can vary from a [[mass demonstration]] to the wearing of a badge with a [[political slogan]]. It was a term popularised in the 1960s but still has some currency.

The term has also been used to describe negotiated statements such as the [[Seville Statement on Violence]] or the [[Waldorf Statement]], or [[extempore]] utterances with political implications.

'''Public interest''' is "the [[welfare]] or [[well-being]] of the [[general public]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415664660/ Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

{{globalize|date=February 2017}}

Public interest has been considered as the core of "[[democratic theories of government]]” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest. With an appendix, containing the modern politico-commercial geography of the several countries of Europe. Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion.

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

{{Update|reason=Uniform Guidance in 2 CFR 200 Subpart F has superseded OMB Circular A-133|date=February 2018}}
In the United States, the '''Single Audit''', Subpart F of the '''OMB Uniform Guidance''', is a rigorous, organization-wide [[audit]] or examination of an entity that expends $750,000 or more of [[administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance]] (commonly known as [[federal funds]], [[federal grant]]s, or federal awards) received for its operations.&lt;ref name="OFFM"&gt;OMB Office of Federal Financial Management, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html The Single Audit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211049/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html |date=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a133/a133_revised_2007.pdf OMB Circular A-133]; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.200 – ''Audit requirements'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;[http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp ''Understanding Single Audits''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920140654/http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp |date=2006-09-20 }} by Henry Flood, Grantsmanship Center Magazine, Fall 2002, retrieved on June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Usually performed annually,&lt;ref name="a133_220"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.220 – ''Frequency of audits''&lt;/ref&gt; the Single Audit's objective is to provide [[Assurance (accounting)|assurance]] to the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] as to the management and use of such funds by [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States#Recipients|recipients]] such as states, cities, universities, non-profit organizations, and Indian Tribes. The audit is typically performed by an independent [[certified public accountant]] (CPA) and encompasses both financial and [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] components. The Single Audits must be submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] along with a data collection form, Form SF-SAC.

==History==
Before implementing the Single Audit, the federal government relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time consuming. To improve this situation, the Single Audit Act of 1984 standardized audit requirements for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments that receive and use federal financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Background; pg. 1-1, par. 1 through 4 and pg. 1–2, par. 1 through 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations" which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Subpart A – ''General''; §___.100 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200(1)"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Title 1 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/26/2013-30465/uniform-administrative-requirements-cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for-federal-awards|title=Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards|date=26 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consolidated requirements are codified in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 200 with the single audit requirements in Subpart F of this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ab9ff8f4b35e7a1839a52514e2e69c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=sp2.1.200.f&amp;rgn=div6|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|website=www.ecfr.gov|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms 2 CFR 200 and Uniform Guidance can be used interchangeably.

==Purpose and components==
The federal government provides an extensive array of federal assistance to recipients reaching over $400 billion annually.&lt;ref name="OFFM"/&gt; This assistance is provided through thousands of individual grants and awards annually for the purpose of benefiting the general public in the areas of education, health, public safety, welfare, and public works, among others. However, as a condition of receiving this assistance recipients must comply with applicable federal and state [[United States law|laws and regulations]], as well as any particular provisions tied with the specific assistance.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro3"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Overview of this Supplement; Internal Control; pg. 1–6, par. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit provides the Federal government with assurance that these recipients comply with such directives by having an independent external source (the CPA) report on such compliance. However, it only applies to state, local government, and nonprofit recipients that expend $750,000 or more of such assistance in one year.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070621150845/http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/financial/fin_single_audit.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041012/http://www.aicpa.org/audcommctr/toolkitsnpo/Single_Audit_Act.htm|title=Single Audits Circular No. A-133: Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Single Audit encompasses an examination of a recipient's financial records, [[financial statements]], federal award transactions and [[expenditure]]s, the general management of its operations, internal control systems, and federal assistance it received during the audit period (the time period of recipient operations examined in the Single Audit, which is usually covers a natural or fiscal year).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of Audit''&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit is divided into two areas: Compliance and Financial.

The compliance component of a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) as well as the testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The financial component is exactly like a [[financial audit]] of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.

For these reasons, the federal government requires auditors to perform the compliance audit of a recipient with a planning stage and an exam stage. During the first stage, or planning stage, the auditor must study the recipient, determine whether there is a high or low risk that the recipient does not comply with laws and regulations, identify federal programs, and evaluate such programs. The second stage, or exam or audit stage, is where the auditor actually audits the federal assistance and programs.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The planning stage is considered an integral part of the Single Audit because it allows the auditor to design and perform the audit based on the qualities, characteristics and needs of the recipient to be audited.

==Compliance audit: planning stage==

===Low- or high-risk auditee===
Before determining which federal programs to examine, the auditor must first determine, based on specific criteria, whether the recipient is a '''high-risk''' auditee or a '''low-risk''' auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has a high risk of not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. The Uniform Guidance has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk auditee. This includes the following to be evaluated for each of the preceding two audit periods:&lt;ref name="a133_530"&gt;2 CFR 200.520&lt;/ref&gt;

* Single audits have been performed on an annual basis in prior years.
* The auditor's opinions on the [[financial statements]] and the Schedule of Federal Expenditures (discussed later) were unmodified.
* There are no material weaknesses identified.
* The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.
*None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:
**Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs;
**A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs; or
**Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.

The Uniform Guidance uses the high and low risk determination to regulate the dollar amount of federal expenditures to be audited. Although the actual work necessary for a Single Audit is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and low-risk auditees. For high-risk auditees, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For low-risk auditees, that limit is decreased to 20%.&lt;ref name="a133_520f"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(f)&lt;/ref&gt;

This determination affects the entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the scope of the audit accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion to the federal government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient procedures to confirm the opinion is correct.&lt;ref name="a133_500d4"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d)(4) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of major programs===

==== Step 1: Type A or Type B ====
To determine which federal programs to audit under the compliance audit, federal assistance expended by the recipient (also called '''federal expenditures''') during one year is identified by federal program name, Federal agency and [[Federal assistance in the United States#Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance#CFDA number|CFDA number]]. These federal expenditures are then combined to determine the total amount expended during the year. Any recipient whose total federal expenditures during a year equal or exceed $750,000 requires a Single Audit.&lt;ref&gt;2 CFR 200.501&lt;/ref&gt; If the recipient does not meet this threshold, a Single Audit is not required, although the recipient may elect to have a program-specific audit (an audit of a single federal program, without auditing the entire entity). Once this determination is performed, 2 CFR 200.518 requires that federal programs be categorized in two groups: Type A programs and Type B programs.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"&gt;2 CFR 200.518&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Type A program''' – a Type A program is any federal program within a recipient that meets the following criteria:
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than or equal to $750,000 and less than or equal to $25 million, then any program that expends more than $750,000 is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $25 million and less than or equal to $100 million, then any program that expends more than 3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $100 million and less than or equal to $1 billion, then any program that expends more than $3 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $1 billion and less than or equal to $10 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $10 billion and less than or equal to $20 billion, then any program that expends more than $30 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $20 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.15% of total federal awards is Type A.
In other words, if a recipient expended a total of $25 million or less in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $750,000 or more is considered a Type A. If a recipient expended $30 million in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $900,000 or more (3% × $30,000,000) is considered a Type A program.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt; Special consideration must be given to large loan programs in determining the Type A threshold.
* '''Type B program''' – A Type B program is any single program which does not meet the Type A requirements.&lt;ref name="a133_520b2"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(b)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
Example 1 – The City of Example operates a Section 8 program, and expended $950,000 in Section 8 funds and $5,000,000 of total federal assistance during the year. Since this amount does not exceed $25,000,000, the Section 8 program is considered a Type A program because $950,000 exceeds the $750,000 threshold.

Example 2 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $30,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is greater than $30,000,000 x 3% ($900,000).

Example 3 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $100,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would not meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is less than $3 million, and would be considered a Type B program.

====Step 2 &amp; 3: Risk assessment====
{{main|Risk assessment}}

After determining which programs are Type A and Type B, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor study and understand the operations and internal controls of such programs within the entity, and perform&lt;ref name="a133_520c"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (c) – ''Step 2''&lt;/ref&gt; and document&lt;ref name="a133_520g"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (g) – ''Documentation of risk''&lt;/ref&gt; a [[risk assessment]] based on such study to determine whether each program has either a high or low risk of not complying with laws and regulations. Auditor may consider numerous factors including current and prior audit experience, good or poor internal controls over Federal programs, many or no prior audit findings, continuous or lack of oversight exercised by the federal government over the recipient, evidence or knowledge of fraud, and the inherent risk of the Federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_525"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.525 – ''Criteria for Federal program risk''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Type A program to be considered low risk according to 2 CFR 200.518, it must have been audited as a major program at least once in the past two years and must not have had:&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;
* Material weaknesses in internal control
* A modified opinion in the audit report
* Known or likely questioned costs exceeding 5% of total federal award expenditures

For any Type A program considered to be a high risk of not complying, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program.&lt;ref name="a133_520e"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (e) – ''Step 4''&lt;/ref&gt; For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the Uniform Guidance allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to.&lt;ref name="a133_520e" /&gt; Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment,&lt;ref name="a133_525" /&gt; the Uniform Guidance does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk.

In assessing the risk of Type B programs, auditors should use professional judgement and criteria established in the Uniform Guidance. According to 2 CFR 200.518, a minimum number of Type B programs must be identified as high risk, calculated as 25% of the number of low-risk Type A programs (rounded up). In assessing risk, auditors are encouraged to use an approach that allows different programs to be identified as high risk over time. The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on smaller Type B programs with expenditures that do not exceed 25% of the Type A threshold determined in step 1. Type B programs which have a low risk of not complying are not required to be audited.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==== Step 4: Major program determination &amp; percentage of coverage ====
High-risk Type A and high-risk Type B programs are considered major programs and must be audited. The auditor then totals all of the federal award expenditures for the identified major programs and divides by the total federal award expenditures for the entity as a whole. For low-risk auditees, major program expenditures as a percentage of total award expenditures must be at least 20%. For high-risk auditees, the required coverage percentage is increased to 40%. If the identified major programs do not meet the required coverage percentage, then the auditor must select additional programs to audit until the required coverage percentage is met.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==Compliance audit: exam stage==
After the auditor determines which federal programs to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes operations of the program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program to see if they complied or not. The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500d"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the amount of federal regulations, the federal government has provided certain guides and literature to assist the auditor in the examination, which includes the OMB Compliance Supplement and the Compliance requirements:&lt;ref name="a133_500d"/&gt;

===OMB compliance supplement===
The OMB Compliance Supplement is a large and extensive guide created by the OMB for Single Audits, and is considered the most important tool of both the auditor and the recipient when performing, or being subject to, a Single Audit.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt; It was created following amendments in 1996 to the Single Audit Act and serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of a Single Audit. Without it, auditors would need to research thousands of laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;

===Compliance requirements===
{{main|Compliance requirements}}

Compliance requirements are series of directives provided by Federal agencies that summarize hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance and are important to the successful management of such assistance. The OMB created 14 basic and standard compliance requirements for which recipients must always comply with when receiving and using federal assistance, and provided detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB Compliance Supplement.&lt;ref name="OMB_cr"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements&lt;/ref&gt; These compliance requirements only serve as guidelines for compliance with the specific laws and regulations applicable to the assistance and their objectives are designed to be generic in nature, because of the amount of different federal programs provided by the government. For example, many federal programs have eligibility requirements for individuals or organizations to participate in such programs because they have been established by either laws, regulations, or contract provisions. However, while the criterion for determining eligibility varies from program to program, the objective of the Eligibility compliance requirement that "only eligible and qualified individuals or organizations participate" is consistent and universal across all federal assistance programs. This eligibility universal criteria is called the '''Eligibility''' compliance requirement.&lt;ref name="OMB_E"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements, pg. 3-E-1, Eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial audit==
{{main|Financial audit}}

The Single Audit requires that a recipient prepare [[financial statements]] that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited.&lt;ref name="a133_310a"&gt;2 CFR 200.510(a)&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires that a [[financial audit]] be performed on the recipient, which includes the federal assistance operations as well as the non-federal assistance operations. Tests of transactions and account balances are performed to ensure that the information presented in the financial statements, and [[notes to the financial statements|notes]] thereof, are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&lt;ref name="a133_500b"&gt;2 CFR 200.514(b)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the recipient must prepare a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), which is supplementary information to the financial statements unique to recipients of federal assistance that details all the federal assistance expended by the recipient during the year, categorized by federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_310b"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.310 – ''Financial Statements''; section (b) – ''Schedule of Federal Expenditures''&lt;/ref&gt; The auditor must then audit and report on this Schedule "in relation to" the financial statements as a whole.

==Data Collection and Reporting Package==
After the Single Audit is concluded, the recipient prepares two documents: a "Data Collection Form and a "Reporting Package". The data collection form, Form SF-SAC, is a standard form which is basically a summary of the Single Audit. It includes details of the auditor, a list of the federal programs audited, and a summary of any audit findings reported by the auditor. The Reporting Package includes all the auditor's final reports along with the recipient's financial statements. It includes:&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (c) – ''Reporting Package''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Auditor's reports
* Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) – This serves as an introduction to the recipient's financial statements where the recipient's management (e.g., Governors, in the case of states; Mayors, in the case of cities; President, in the case of non-profit organizations, etc.) discusses the results of operations and other financial information, offering insight and detailed description about the recipient itself.
* Recipient's financial statements – This contains the financial statements required by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB), which includes the Government-wide statements as well as the Fund Financial Statements.
* Recipient's [[notes to the financial statements]] – This includes any notes and disclosures for the financial statements as required by [[US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP).
* Supplemental Information – This section includes both financial and non-financial information relative to the recipient which is not covered in the MD&amp;A or the financial statements and their respective notes.
* Schedule of Federal Award Expenditures – This document details all federal assistance expenditures made by the recipient during the audit period, categorized by the federal program and federal agency.
* Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs – If the auditor finds situations where the recipient did not comply with laws and regulations, where internal controls are deficient, or a situation of illegal acts or fraud, the auditor is required to report such situations to the federal government in this section, as well as any questioned costs. Questioned costs are amounts that the recipient expended, but which the auditor has determined that they were not permitted and must be returned to the federal government.&lt;ref name="a133_505"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.505 – ''Audit reporting''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schedule of Prior Audit Findings – In this section, the auditor is required to follow up and report about the recipient's corrective action on any audit findings reported in prior years.

Both the Data Collection and the Reporting Package are kept by the recipient with copies submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] (FAC), and to any Federal agency who specifically requests it.&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (d) – Submission to clearinghouse''&lt;/ref&gt; Federal guidelines require recipients to submit the documents no more than 30 days after the auditor submits his reports or 9 months after the final day of the audit period, whichever comes first.&lt;ref name="a133_320"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditor responsibility==
The auditor is responsible for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with [[Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards]] (GAGAS)&lt;ref name="a133_500a"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (a) – ''General''&lt;/ref&gt; and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient's federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.

The auditor must understand the recipient's internal control system to determine if the recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient's internal control system works properly, and the recipient's federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (c) – ''Internal control''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"&gt;''The Single Audit Act'', AICPA&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Single Audit, the auditor must prepare and submit three individual reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient's financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit's report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is about the status of internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on the degree to which the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.&lt;ref name="a133_505"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"/&gt;

The auditor's judgment is necessary to determine which audit procedures are sufficient to achieve the audit objectives, and whether additional or alternative audit procedures are needed to achieve such objectives. The auditor is responsible for determining the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures necessary to meet the audit objectives (i.e., it is the auditor who determines the necessary amount of his/her audit work needed to form an opinion on whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations).

'''Tacitean studies''', centred on the work of [[Tacitus]] ({{circa|56}} &amp;ndash; {{circa|120 AD}}) the [[Ancient Roman]] historian, constitute an area of scholarship extending beyond the field of history. The work has traditionally been read for its moral instruction, its narrative, and its inimitable prose style; Tacitus has been (and still is) most influential as a political theorist, outside the field of history.{{ref|remembrance}} The political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps (as identified by [[Giuseppe Toffanin]]): the "red Tacitists", who used him to support [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, and the "black Tacitists", those who read his accounts as a lesson in [[Machiavellian]] ''[[Realpolitik]]''.{{ref|redandblack}}

Though his work is the most reliable source for the history of his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned: the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' are based in part on secondary sources of unknown reliability, and there are some obvious minor mistakes (for instance confusing the two daughters of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], both named Antonia). The ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', written from primary documents and personal knowledge of the Flavian period, is thought to be more accurate, though Tacitus's hatred of Domitian seemingly colored its tone and interpretations.

==Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Tacitus's contemporaries were well-acquainted with his work; [[Pliny the Younger]], one of his first admirers, congratulated him for his better-than-usual precision and predicted that his ''Histories'' would be immortal: only a third of his known work has survived and then through a very tenuous textual tradition; we depend on a single manuscript for books I-VI of the ''Annales'' and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI-XVI) and for the five books extant of the ''Historiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael, ''Latin Literature: an anthology'', Penguin Classics, London, 1978 p.378f&lt;/ref&gt; His books were clearly used by 2nd-early 3rd century historians such as [[Cassius Dio]]'s report on Agricola's exploration of Britain, and [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] may have borrowed from his account of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]].{{ref|dio}} His difficult historical methods and elliptic literary style, however, went unimitated except by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], who consciously set out to write a continuation of his works.{{ref|ammianus}} His popularity waned with time: his unfavorable portrayals of the early emperors could not have earned him favor with Rome's increasingly autocratic rulers, and his obvious contempt for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] (both troublesome foreign cults in the eyes of a 1st-century Roman aristocrat) made him unpopular among the early [[Church Fathers]].{{ref|patres}} The 3rd century writer [[Tertullian]], for example, blames him (incorrectly&amp;mdash;see [[history of anti-Semitism]]) for originating the story that the Jews worshipped a donkey's head in the [[Holy of Holies]] and calls him "''ille mendaciorum loquacissimus''", 'the most loquacious of liars'.{{ref|tertullian}}

[[Image:Einhard.jpg|thumb|left|Monks like [[Einhard]] were the only readers of Tacitus for most of the [[Middle Ages]].]]
In the 4th century there are scattered references to his life and work. Flavius Vopiscus, one of the supposed ''[[Augustan History|Scriptores Historiae Augustae]]'', mentions him twice ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/1*.html#2 ''Aurelian'' 2.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html#2.7 ''Probus'' 2.7.]) and names him among the ''disertissimos viros'', the most eloquent men. Ammianus Marcellinus, as mentioned, started his history where Tacitus had finished. [[Jerome]] knew of him, and [[Sulpicius Severus]] either used his [[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]] as a source for passages on [[Nero]]{{ref|4thcentury}} or, according to Aurthur Drews, the passage in [[Sulpicius Severus]]'s Chronicles later found its way into [[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]]. By the 5th century only a few authors seem aware of him: [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], who admires him, and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], who alternately derides him as a fool and borrows passages (including many that are otherwise lost) from his works.{{ref|5thcentury}} [[Cassiodorus]] and his disciple [[Jordanes]] (middle of the 6th century) make the last known antique references; Cassiodorus draws on parts of the ''Germania'' and Jordanes cites the ''Agricola'', but both know the author only as ''Cornelius''.{{ref|Cassiodorus}}

After Jordanes, Tacitus disappeared from literature for the better part of two centuries, and only four certain references appear until 1360. Two come from [[Franks|Frankish]] monks of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' from the [[Fulda|monastery of Fulda]] used Tacitus's ''Annals'', and [[Rudolf of Fulda]] borrowed from the ''Germania'' for his ''Translatio Sancti Alexandri''.{{ref|fulda}} Some of Tacitus's works were known at [[Monte Cassino]] by 1100, where the other two certain references appear: [[Peter the Deacon]]'s ''Vita Sancti Severi'' used the ''Agricola'', and [[Paulinus Venetus]], [[Bishop of Pozzuoli]], plagiarized passages from the ''Annals'' in his ''[[mappa mundi]]''.{{ref|montecassino}} Hints and reminiscences of Tacitus appear in French and English literature, as well as German and Italian, from the 12th to the 14th century, but none of them are at all certain.{{ref|hints}} It was not until [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] brought the manuscript of the ''Annals'' 11-16 and the ''Histories'' out of Monte Cassino to [[Florence]], in the 1360s or 1370s, that Tacitus began to regain some of his old literary importance. His Annals survive only in single copies of two halves of the works, one from Fulda and one from Cassino.

==Italian Renaissance==
[[Image:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo Bruni was the first to use Tacitus as a source for political philosophy.]]
Boccaccio's efforts brought the works of Tacitus back into public circulation&amp;mdash;where they were largely passed over by the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanists]] of the 14th and 15th centuries, who preferred the smooth style of Cicero and the patriotic history of [[Livy]], who was by far their favorite historian.{{ref|livy}} The first to read his works&amp;mdash;they were four: Boccacio, Benvenuto Rambaldi, Domenico Bandini, and [[Coluccio Salutati]]&amp;mdash;read them solely for their historical information and their literary style. On the merits of these they were divided.{{ref|humanists}} Bandini called him "[a] most eloquent orator and historian",{{ref|bandini}} while Salutati commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For what shall I say about Cornelius Tacitus? Although a very learned man, he wasn't able to equal those closest [to Cicero]. But he was even way behind Livy&amp;mdash;whom he proposed to follow&amp;mdash;not only in historical series but in imitation of eloquence.{{ref|salutati}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of Tacitus as a source for [[political philosophy]], however, began in this era, triggered by the [[Florentine Republic]]'s struggle against the imperial ambitions of [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]]. Visconti's death from an illness did more than lift his siege of Florence; it sparked [[Leonardo Bruni]] to write his ''Panegyric to the City of Florence'' (c. 1403), in which he quoted Tacitus (''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]) to buttress his [[republicanism|republican]] theory that monarchy was inimical to virtue, nobility, and (especially) genius.{{ref|bruni}} The inspiration was novel&amp;mdash;Bruni had probably learned of Tacitus from Salutati. The thesis likewise: Tacitus himself had acknowledged that the good emperors Nerva and Trajan posed no threat to his endeavors.{{ref|bruni_thesis}}

Tacitus, and the theory which Bruni based on him, played a vital role in the spirited debate between the republicans of Florence and the proponents of monarchy and aristocracy elsewhere. [[Guarino da Verona]], in 1435, used the literary flowering of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus's]] era&amp;mdash;which included Livy, [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]&amp;mdash;to argue against Bruni's contention; [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini]] countered with the argument that all the authors had been born during the waning years of the [[Roman Republic]]. [[Pietro Candido Decembrio|Pier Candido Decembrio]], a [[Milan]]ese courtier, addressed the same argument to Bruni in the following year, which Bruni did not bother to rebut, the best counterargument having been made already.{{ref|15thc_political}} The rule of [[Cosimo de Medici]], however, saw the end of these political readings of Tacitus, though his works were now readily available in the public library of Florence. Instead, scholars such as [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] used him in academic works on the history and architecture of 1st century Rome. His laconic style and bleak outlook remained unpopular.{{ref|15thc_academic}}

[[Image:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|right|Niccolò Machiavelli occasionally resembles Tacitus in his pessimistic realism, but he himself preferred Livy.]]
At the beginning of the 15th century, following the expulsion of the [[Medici]] from Florence, their return, and the [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification|foreign invasions of Italy]], Tacitus returned to prominence among the theorists of [[classical republicanism]]. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was the first to revive him, but not (at first) in the republican model which Bruni and others had followed. One quotation from the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.19 13.19]) appears in ''[[The Prince]]'' (ch. [http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince13.htm 13]), advising the ruler that "it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength".{{ref|principe}} The idealized Prince bears some resemblance to Tacitus's Tiberius; a few (most notably Giuseppe Toffanin) have argued that Machiavelli had made more use of Tacitus than he let on. In fact, though, Machiavelli had probably not read the first books of the ''Annals'' at that time&amp;mdash;they were published after ''The Prince''.{{ref|toffanin}}

In his overtly republican ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy]]'', Machiavelli returned to Bruni's republican perspective on Tacitus. Four overt references appear in the work. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm#1:10 1.10] follows Tacitus (''Histories'' 1.1), and Bruni, on the chilling effects of monarchy. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm#1:29 1.29] quotes the ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+4.3 4.3]) on the burden of gratitude and the pleasure of revenge. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm#3:06 3.6] quotes Tacitus&lt;!--not sure exactly which passage--&gt;: "men have to honor things past but obey the present, and ought to desire good Princes, but tolerate the ones they have". [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm#3:19 3.19] twists a line from Tacitus ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+3.55 3.55]) into something very similar to Machiavelli's famous maxim that it is better for a prince to be feared than loved. (The original made a very different point: that respect for the Emperor and a desire to conform, not fear and punishment, kept certain senators in line.) Many covert references appear: Machiavelli generally follows Tacitus's decidedly negative slant on the history of Rome under the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]].{{ref|Machiavelli}}

Machiavelli had read Tacitus for instruction on [[form of government|forms of government]], republican as well as autocratic, but after his books were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', writers on political philosophy (the so-called "black Tacitists"&amp;mdash;see above) frequently used the Roman as a stand-in for the Florentine (that is the ''Machiavellian'' part of the Florentine), and the Emperor Tiberius as a mask for the ideal Prince. So, writers like [[Francesco Guicciardini]] considered Tacitus' work to be an instruction on how to build a despotic state. Following that line of thought (Catholics in appearance reading ''Tacitus'' instead of Machiavelli's still forbidden ''Prince''), the thinkers of the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the age of absolute monarchies used his works as a set of rules and principles for political action.
Girolamo Cardano in his 1562 book ''Encomium Neronis'' describes Tacitus as a scoundrel of the worst kind, belonging to the rich senatorial class and always taking their side against the conmmon people.

==Enlightenment and revolutions==
Early theoreticians of ''[[raison d'état]]'' used Tacitus to defend an ideal of Imperial rule. Other readers used him to construct a method for living under a despotic state, avoiding both servility and useless opposition. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], for example, used Tacitus' works, in his apology for Seneca, to justify the collaboration of philosophers with the sovereign.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Tacitus was mostly admired for his opposition to despotism. In literature, some great tragedians such as [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Vittorio Alfieri|Alfieri]], took inspirations from Tacitus for their dramatic characters.

[[Edward Gibbon]] was strongly influenced by Tacitus' historical style in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'',

The [[French Revolution]]aries, for whom Tacitus had been a central part of their early education,
made much use of his criticisms of tyranny and love of the [[republic]]&amp;mdash;he is one of the authors most often quoted (behind Cicero, Horace, and Plutarch) by the members of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National]] and [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assemblies]] and by revolutionary authors such as [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]]. Later, during the [[Reign of Terror]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] and the writers of the ''[[Actes des apôtres]]'' used him to denounce the excesses of the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]].{{ref|frevolution}}

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], on the other hand, attacked his works furiously, both for style and contents. This would-be founder of an Imperial dynasty, praised by amongst others [[Goethe]] for his insight in literature, knew the danger that Tacitus's histories might pose to one who wished to go around grabbing for power. [[François-René de Chateaubriand|François de Chateaubriand]], for one, had already compared the new Emperor of the French to the worst emperors of Rome, warning that a new Tacitus would someday do for Napoleon what Tacitus had done for Nero. The Emperor's reaction was vicious: to Goethe and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] he complained that "[[Tacitus]] finds criminal intention in the simplest acts; he makes complete scoundrels out of all the emperors to make us admire his genius in exposing them". To others he swore that Tacitus, ''ce [[pamphleteer|pamphlétaire]]'', had "slandered the emperors" whom, he averred, the Roman people had loved.{{ref|Napoleon}}

==Twentieth century==
By the 20th century authenticity of the remaining texts ascribed to Tacitus was generally acknowledged, apart from some difference of opinion about the ''[[dialogus de oratoribus|Dialogus]]''. Tacitus became a stock part of any education in classical literature&amp;nbsp;– usually, however, only after the study of Caesar, Livy, Cicero, etc., while Tacitus' style requires a greater understanding of the Latin language, and is perceived as less "classical" than the authors of the Augustan age.

A remarkable feat was accomplished by [[Robert Graves]]: the major gap of text that had gone lost of the ''Annals'' regarded parts of the end of [[Tiberius]]' reign, the whole of [[Caligula]]'s reign, and the major part of [[Claudius]]' reign (the remaining part of Tacitus' manuscript only took up again at this Emperor's death, for the transition to the reign of [[Nero]]). Robert Graves' 1934 ''[[I, Claudius]]'', and the ensuing ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (1935) filled the gap perfectly: all the missing parts of the Annals, up to the latter part of the reign of Claudius himself, were covered by a coherent story. Of course part of it can be considered "mockumentary" in the ''[[Augustan History]]'' tradition (for example how Claudius really felt about [[republicanism]], heavily elaborated by Graves sometimes based on "reconstructed" historical documents, will probably never be really established). Graves borrowed much from Tacitus' style: apart from the "directness" of an Emperor pictured to write down his ''memoires'' for private use (linked to the "lost testament of Claudius" mentioned in Tacitus' ''Annals''), the treatment is also on a year-by-year basis, with digressions not unlike Tacitus' "moralising" digressions, so that in the introduction of the second of these two volumes Graves saw fit to defend himself as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some reviewers of ''I, Claudius'', the prefatory volume to ''Claudius the God'', suggested that in writing it I had merely consulted Tacitus's ''Annals'' and [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]'', run them together, and expanded the result with my own "vigorous fancy." This was not so; nor is it the case here. Among the Classical writers who have been borrowed from in the composition of ''Claudius the God'' are Tacitus, Cassius Dio, Suetonius, [[Pliny (disambiguation)|Pliny]]&lt;!--ambiguity is deliberate, please don't fix it--&gt;, [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Frontinus]], [[Strabo]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Columella]], [[Plutarch]], [[Josephus]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], [[John Xiphilinus|Xiphilinus]], [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Petronius]], [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], [[Philo]], [[Celsus]], the authors of the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' and of the pseudo-gospels of [[Nicodemus]] and [[James the Just|St. James]], and Claudius himself in his surviving letters and speeches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...no doubt, Tacitus remains the first author mentioned in this list.

Graves' work reflected back on the perception of Tacitus' work: Graves curbed the "slandering of Emperors" by portraying Claudius as a good-humoured emperor, at heart a ''republican'' (...probably stretching some of Claudius' ''naivety'' to accomplish that effect) - resulting in the perception that if the "Claudius" part of Tacitus' annals had survived it probably wouldn't have been all slander towards the emperors of the 1st century.{{ref|series}} The more explicit defence of republicanism in Graves' work (that is: ''much more'' explicit than in Tacitus' work) also made any further direct defense of ''black Tacitism'' quite impossible (as far as Napoleon, by ''not'' advocating a ''black Tacitism'' line of thought hadn't already made such interpretation obsolete).

By the end of 20th century, however, a sort of ''inverted red tacitism'' (as the new variant of black tacitism could be called) appeared, for example in publications like [[#References|Woodman's ''Tacitus reviewed'']]: the new theories described the emperors of the [[principate]] no longer as ''[[monarch]]s'' ruling as [[Autocracy|autocrat]]s, but as "magistrates" in essence defending a "republican" form of government (which might excuse some of their rash actions), very much in line with Graves' lenient posture regarding crimes committed under the rule of ''princeps'' Claudius (for instance the putting aside of the [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus|elder L. Silanus]], showing the emperor's lack of conscience according to Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' XII,3; while Graves' account of the same incident appears not to incriminate Claudius).

==Twenty-first century==
One of Tacitus' polemics against the evils of empire, from his ''Agricola'' (ch. 30), was often quoted during the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasions of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], by those who found its warnings as applicable to the modern era as to the ancient (see for example
[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,930843,00.html ''The Guardian'']). It reads, in part:
:{|-
|Raptores orbis, postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere terrae, iam mare scrutantur: si locuples hostis est, avari, si pauper, ambitiosi, quos non Oriens, non Occidens satiaverit [...]&lt;br /&gt;Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.
|&amp;nbsp;
|Brigands of the world, after the earth has failed their all-devastating hands, they probe even the sea; if their enemy be wealthy, they are greedy; if he be poor, they are ambitious; neither the East nor the West has glutted them [...]&lt;br /&gt;They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal: this they falsely name Empire, and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.
|}

#{{note|Napoleon}} Mellor, pp. xlviii&amp;ndash;xlix, 194&amp;ndash;199. Tacitus couldn't be worried less (''Ann.'' IV,35): "''quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet qui praesenti potentia credunt extingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memoriam. nam contra punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas, neque aliud externi reges aut qui eadem saevitia usi sunt nisi dedecus sibi atque illis gloriam peperere.''" - "And so one is all the more inclined to laugh at the stupidity of men who suppose that the despotism of the present can actually efface the remembrances of the next generation. On the contrary, the persecution of genius fosters its influence; foreign tyrants, and all who have imitated their oppression, have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their victims."
#{{note|series}} A website discussing the ''I, Claudius'' television series, which were based on Graves work, qualifies Tacitus as being of a "somewhat suspect" reliability because of Tacitus' so-called "malice" towards the emperors (see: http://www.anselm.edu/internet/classics/I%2CCLAUDIUS/tacitus.html ). The books by Graves, discussed at the same website (see: http://www.anselm.edu/internet/classics/I%2CCLAUDIUS/graves.html ) are free of such reliability suspicions. So, in sum that website says: Tacitus is not very reliable because he slanders Emperors. Graves is reliable because his story-telling of the Imperial household is so ''convincing''.

As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"/&gt;

==History of art and social and political change==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."&lt;ref name=Groys&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;[[Cf.]] Silver 11, as qtd. in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n2_v55/ai_18533947/pg_3 book rev.] by Graham: "Power attracts artists and in turn promotes the artists who succeed within that power structure."  Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."&lt;ref name=Slackman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== The role of poetry ==

{{Quote|text=Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.|sign=[[Percy B. Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]|source=''[[A Defence of Poetry]]''}}

The Italian poet [[Ungaretti]], when interviewed on transgression by director [[Pasolini]] for the 1964 ''[[Love Meetings]]'' documentary, said that the foundation of [[poetry]] is to transgress all laws: "I am a poet and as such I begin transgressing all the laws by doing poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pasolini]] (1964) ''[[Love Meetings]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EerTTC-YO8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].&lt;ref name=Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Poli|first=Francesco|others=Trans. F. Scarpelli and A. Andreacchio|title=I situazionisti e la loro storia|editor=Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti|publisher=Manifestolibri|location=Rome|year=2006|pages=63|isbn=978-88-7285-438-9 |quote=caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms .&lt;ref name=Bandini&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandini|first=Mirella|title=L'estetico, il politico. Da Cobra all'Internazionale situazionista 1948-1957|publisher=Costa &amp; Nolan|year=1999|pages=408|isbn=978-88-7648-344-8|language=Italian|quote=Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Poster art===
"Not content with claiming [[Left-wing politics|leftwing]] music", posters for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK recycled iconic art styles of "[[Socialism|socialist]] revolution" to communicate its political message in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

===''Entropa''===
Czech [[sculptor]] [[David Černý]]'s ''[[Entropa]]'', a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the [[European Council|European Union Council]] during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entropa'' attracted controversy both for its [[stereotype]]d depictions of the various [[European Union|EU]] member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than, as Černý purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;  Some [[European Union|EU]] members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with [[Bulgaria]], for instance, deciding to summon the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Ambassador to [[Sofia]] in order to discuss the illustration of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] country as a collection of [[squat toilet]]s (ČTK).  This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former [[East Germany|East German]]&amp;ndash;[[West Germany|West German]] border in Berlin, a concert [[Public Broadcasting Service|telecast nationally]] in the United States, he substituted ''Freedom'' for ''Joy'' to reflect his own "personal message".&lt;ref&gt;

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".&lt;ref name="Robeson"&gt;

|accessdate=2009-07-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the account of the "Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration": "Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."&lt;ref name="Robeson"/&gt;

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Restrictions on live-music venues===
====In the United States====
In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a [[Draco (lawgiver)#"Draconian"|Draconian]] "anti-music law", the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in [[Seattle]], Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in [[United States Federal Courts|U.S. Federal Court]] in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPAC's suit, finding no Constitutional infringement of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and deciding that the matter is a political one for the [[Seattle City Council]] to decide, not the courts; during the course of the suit, Mayor Schell's successor, [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council, and, on 12 August 2002, the new All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) replaced the TDO,&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2008 a "Promoters Ordinance" proposed by the [[Chicago City Council]] aroused opposition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], for being regarded as overly restrictive and stifling [[Freedom of speech|free expression]].&lt;ref&gt;

Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the perceived "demand" for the information solicited on such "[[risk assessment]]" forms motivated [[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and The Makers]], to post an [[Internet petition|electronic petition]] in the "E-Petitions" section of the official website of [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], at  Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is "[[Racism|racial discrimination]]" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints,&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;

However all musical performances – from one man playing a guitar on up – are subject to the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue'. ... UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year. He said they weren't [[Wiktionary:compulsory|compulsory]]: ... 'We can't demand it – we recommend that you provide it as best practice. But you're bloody silly if you don't, because you're putting your venue at risk.'&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  By early March 2009, over 16,000 British citizens or residents had signed McClure's E-Petition, which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

'''''Theologia Poetica''''' ("poetic theology") was a designation adopted throughout the [[Renaissance]] for [[political philosophy]] independent of Biblical revelation.  In Italy, discussions on "poetic theology" were articulated most notably by [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]], both of whom promoted a philosophical life capable of withstanding the inquisitorial scrutiny of theological orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Meltzoff. 1987.  ''Botticelli, Signorelli and Savonarola: "Theologia Poetica" and Painting from Boccaccio to Poliziano''.  Firenze: S. Olschki.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian appeal to poetic theology finds its historical consummation in the works of [[Giambattista Vico]], and most notably in his [[Scienza Nuova]] (1730 and 1744), where the political philosopher highlights the independence of pre-philosophical poetic theologians ("authors of gentile nations") from Biblical revelation, and thus too, Christianity's sacred history.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Vico, ''Scienza Nuova'' (1744), "Of the Method," final paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;   Vico argues at length that the "authors" (''autori'') of civil society preceded by far its "writers" (''scrittori''), so that a problematic hiatus separates the two, as it does things and the records we have of them in words.  Vico's enterprise consists of discovering the inherence of order in things—and of "right in human nature"—lest order and right be conceived as merely imposed upon things by "writers" according to their whims (''a placito''), as is the case with all dogmatic theology, but also—so argues Vico already in his ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia''—with modern "science," insofar as it identifies what is true with what is "most certain" (''certissima'').&lt;ref&gt;''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'', Ch. I.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Vico's references to "poet theologians" (''poeti teologi'') point overtly to pre-philosophical authorities, Vico presents himself, if only tacitly or obliquely, as a poet theologian in his own right.  In this respect, as Paolo Cristofolini &lt;ref&gt;Paolo Cristofolini, "Da Dante a Omero, Da Gravina a Vico," in 2007.  ''Giambattista Vico e l'Enciclopedia dei saperi''.  A. Battistini and P. Guaragnella, eds.  Lecce: Pensa Multimedia.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown, Vico recognizes himself as a "new Dante," or a poet theologian who is at once a philosopher.  Vico's own ''Scienza Nuova'' presents itself—most notably in the first and last paragraphs of the work—as discovering the providence of a "metaphysical" human mind in the world of human wills (''animi umani'').  If our own intellect (''intelligenza'') is at work in us prior to our recognizing it (indeed even when we live as brutes),&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Vico, ''Scienza Nuova'' (1744), "Of the Method," par. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy too must "covertly" precede sensory experience as the hidden author of our world (hence Vico's dictum, included in his ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'', Ch. VII.3, to the effect that just as God is the artifex of nature, so is man the God of artifices: ''ut Deus sit naturae artifex, homo artificiorum Deus'').&lt;ref&gt;Marco Andreacchio.  2013.  "[https://www.academia.edu/7431201/Autobiography_as_History_of_Ideas_an_Intimate_Reading_of_Vicos_Vita_from_Lord_Vico_to_The_Names_of_Law_ Autobiography as History of Ideas: an Intimate Reading of Vico's ''Vita'' (from «Lord Vico» to «The Names of Law»)]," in ''Historia Philosophica: An International Journal'', Vol. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Pennsylvania Voter Laws==

If a citizen consistently votes in Pennsylvania, they do not need to re-register before the next election except to update information such as address, name, party if anything has changed. In order to become a registered voter in Pennsylvania, one must obtain US citizenship at least one month prior to the election date, be at least 18 years old by the next election date, and live in the district they will be voting in for at least 30 days prior to the election date. Those in prison for a felony are not permitted to vote, but one can vote if they are on parole or probation. To be eligible to vote, one must complete registration a minimum of 30 days prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Voter Law|url=http://www.dmv.pa.gov/Information-Centers/Laws-Regulations/Pages/Motor-Voter-Law.aspx|website=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in Pennsylvania, no identification is required if it is not one’s first time voting, and they should not be asked to provide any form of identification. If it is one’s first time voting, or voting in a particular district, they will be required to show some form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include: driver’s license; US passport; military, student, or employee ID; voter registration card; firearm permit; current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government check; any other form of identification issued by the commonwealth or federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.pa.gov/guides/voting-and-elections/|website=PA.gov|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no documents are required to vote in Pennsylvania, voters are asked to provide their signature to verify with a signature kept on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Underhill|first1=Wendy|title=Voter Identification Requirements {{!}} Voter ID Laws|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Voter ID Law==

On March 14th, 2012, Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a Voter ID bill into law, after it had been passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Voter ID law would require everyone who sought to vote to have specified types of photo identification before they could vote. The bill was pushed for and passed by Republican legislators who claimed that the bill was imperative to preventing voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Voter ID law was one of the most prohibitive in the entire country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of the law claimed that this would prevent groups such as the older population and minorities from voting as they would be less likely to possess or be able to obtain the kinds of identifications specified by the law. This was substantiated in 2014 when a 2012 video of then Majority Leader Mike Turzai was leaked. In the recording, he described the passage of the Voter ID law as a successful plan to help Mitt Romney’s chances of winning Pennsylvania in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Everything you need to know about the Pennsylvania voter ID fight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2012/10/02/the-pennsylvania-voter-id-fight-explained/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also cited data from the Commonwealth that showed they had no evidence to corroborate the claim that voter fraud was a large issue as they had zero cases of a casting of a fraudulent vote on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Constitutional challenge ===

When the Voter ID bill was taken to court in 2012, it was initially upheld by Commonwealth Judge Robert Simpson. Judge Simpson did say that Mike Turzai’s comments about the law concerned him, but despite his concern, he decided to uphold the law because regardless of what burdens it placed on people, the verbiage of the law and its implementation applied its stipulations to everybody in the state. He also argued that although he did see how it could impose upon the liberty of the voters, he felt that the actual purpose of the law was fair and outweighed the costs of its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richey|first1=W|title=Why judge refused to block Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=The Christian Science Monitor|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court, but sent back to Simpson who then issued a decision saying that the law would not be implemented for the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laslo|first1=B|title=Commentary: Real fraud is in Pennsylvania Voter ID law|agency=The Daily Record|publisher=The Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voter ID law while technically in effect was not enforced at polling places in 2012l&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A group of civil rights and legal organizations banded together to contest the law in court. Their goal was to have the law struck down by the 2012 presidential elections, as they felt the law was more about Republican advantage than preventing voter fraud, however it was not decided until 2014{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The official lawsuit was Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The group of rights organizations represented 10 plaintiffs, all of which would be prevented from voting in the 2012 presidential election if the Voter ID law would be allowed to remain in place. Vic Walczak, a representative from the Pennsylvania ACLU, argued on behalf of these plaintiffs and pointed out that people who will not be able to produce the necessary forms of identification mostly fit into two categories: annual income of less than $20,000 and not possessing a GED. Hispanics and women were also populations with large amounts facing difficulty with obtaining these proper forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaynor|first1=Gerren Keith|title=Coalition files lawsuit against Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=New York New Amsterdam Times|publisher=New York New Amsterdam Times|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was heard by Honorable Bernard L. McGinley. McGinley declared the law to be unconstitutional, and that it placed unfair pressure on the rights of the citizen to vote and participate in elections as it required such specific forms of identification to cast a ballot, types of IDs that were not necessarily feasible for everyone to obtain or were equally accessible. He ruled that the law could not be put into action. In his opinion, he alluded to the fact that although the law did not specifically target people through its language, it would disenfranchise certain groups and people who had more trouble obtaining the necessary identification required under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Full Order|url=https://www.pubintlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voter-ID-Final-Order.pdf|website=The Public Interest Law Center|publisher=The Public Interest Law Center|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinley also said in his decision that the state’s argument that photo identification was necessary to prove people’s identities and protect the elections did not clearly show a link between photo IDs and safer, better elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malloy|first1=Allie|title=Judge strikes down Pennsylvania voter ID law, calls it burdensome|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/17/politics/pennsylvania-voter-id-law/index.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fallout===
The decision in Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the Voter ID law led to similar challenges to voter ID laws in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Ari|title=Pennsylvania Ruling Shows the Problem With Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/pennsylvania-ruling-shows-problem-voter-id-laws/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Nation|publisher=The Nation|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the 2012 Voter ID law in Pennsylvania had been struck down in 2014, people were still experiencing problems with being asked for identification beyond their voter card when they went to the polls for the 2016 presidential election. There were several reports from people across the state that they had been asked for some form of identification that was not required under law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC)''' was an international [[Advocacy group|advocacy]] organization, created in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424602884.html]&lt;/ref&gt; representing [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish refugees from Arab countries]]. The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries was created to make certain that any "just settlement of the refugee problem" recognizes those Jews who were forced to flee from lands where they had lived for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm THE OTHER REFUGEES: JEWS OF THE ARAB WORLD]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WOJAC functioned for approximately 25 years (from 1975 until 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav. ''Ethnicity and National Memory: The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) in the Context of the Palestinian National Struggle''. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2016}} WOJAC's aspiration was to operate in the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the Palestinian leadership on the right to the land and on the refugee question.
